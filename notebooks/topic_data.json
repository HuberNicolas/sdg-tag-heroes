        "document": "Title: Internal consistency reliability is a poor predictor of responsiveness\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Whether responsiveness represents a measurement property of health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments that is distinct from reliability and validity is an issue of debate. We addressed the claims of a recent study, which suggested that investigators could rely on internal consistency to reflect instrument responsiveness. METHODS: 516 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or knee injury participating in four longitudinal studies completed generic and disease-specific HRQL questionnaires before and after an intervention that impacted on HRQL. We used Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression to assess the relationship between internal consistency reliability (expressed as Cronbach's alpha), instrument type (generic and disease-specific) and responsiveness (expressed as the standardised response mean, SRM). RESULTS: Mean Cronbach's alpha was 0.83 (SD 0.08) and mean SRM was 0.59 (SD 0.33). The correlation between Cronbach's alpha and SRMs was 0.10 (95% CI -0.12 to 0.32) across all studies. Cronbach's alpha alone did not explain variability in SRMs (p = 0.59, r2 = 0.01) whereas the type of instrument was a strong predictor of the SRM (p = 0.012, r2 = 0.37). In multivariable models applied to individual studies Cronbach's alpha consistently failed to predict SRMs (regression coefficients between -0.45 and 1.58, p-values between 0.15 and 0.98) whereas the type of instrument did predict SRMs (regression coefficients between -0.25 to -0.59, p-values between <0.01 and 0.05). CONCLUSION: Investigators must look to data other than internal consistency reliability to select a responsive instrument for use as an outcome in clinical trials.",

However, few studies have investigated the genealogy in complete social groups of free-living animals with low reproductive skew. This holds particularly true for bats. Although almost all bat species are social, their sociobiology is not well understood. Because they are volant, nocturnal and have a rather cryptic life-style, bats are difficult to observe in the wild. Furthermore females are generally gregarious making genetic parent-offspring assignment a challenging task. We used genetic markers in combination with knowledge about age and colony membership of individually marked bats to construct pedigrees in completely sampled maternity colonies of Bechstein's bats (Myotis bechsteinii). Despite considerable fluctuations in population size, no immigration occurred over 5 years in four colonies living in close proximity. Additionally, confrontation tests showed that females of one maternity colony were able to detect and attempted to prevent the intrusion of foreign females into a roost they occupy. Although colonies were absolutely closed, and 75% of the colony members lived together with close relatives (rS=0.25), mean colony relatedness was nearly zero (0.02). Average relatedness therefore is a poor estimator for the potential of kin selection in Bechstein's bat colonies and may be misleading when attempting to understand the social structure of animals living in groups where many members breed. Based on our results we discuss the potential adaptive value of living in closed societies with low reproductive skew.",

This paper describes such circumstances in a two-class model. Social stability constraints define the acceptable set of income distributions, the range of which is determined by the extent to which income-generating abilities are vulnerable to disruption. Opportunities for disruption vary across stages of economic development. There is possibly no stable distribution in a low developed economy, whereas in an advanced economy, characterized by complex and interdependent production, stable distributions exist. This distinction provides a basis for the observed increasing significance of social stabilization by redistributive policy in the course of economic development.",

It starts by noting that a high and increasing share of health care expenditure in the GDP does not per se indicate a need for reform. Rather, the guiding idea is that decisions in the health care sector should be tied more closely to the preferences of consumers, who must obtain more ways to express their willingness-to-pay. The 10 proposals are directed to health insurers, physicians and medical associations, hospital management, and policy makers proper. Moreover, initial steps for implementing them are sketched, such as abolishing the division of lines in the regulation of (private) insurance, freeing health insurers from any-willing-provider clauses, refraining from imposing uniform nationwide fee schedules, and directly subsidizing poor consumers for buying health insurance rather than institutions such as hospitals and homes for long-term care.",

        "document": "Title: Secondary manifestation of medulloblastoma: metastases and local recurrences in 66 patients\nAbstract: Although primary treatment of medulloblastoma is now successful in a high percentage of patients, its secondary manifestations still bear a poor prognosis. Thorough studies of secondary manifestations are therefore pivotal to plan therapeutic approaches for the long-term management of medulloblastoma. Here we describe the incidence of secondary tumour manifestations in 66 patients of a single centre who underwent surgery for medulloblastoma between 1975 and 1990. No patient was excluded due to a poor postoperative course. Thirty-five patients showed evidence of secondary tumour growth. Of these, 17 suffered from local recurrence, and 27 developed metastastatic disease. The median latencies for secondary manifestations were 25 months for local recurrence (n = 17), 11 months for spinal metastases (n = 10), 15 months for supratentorial metastases (n = 8), 8 months for subleptomeningeal dissemination (n = 6), and 23 months for systemic metastases (n = 8). Two patients developed primary metastatic spread to the posterior fossa. Of 8 patients with supratentorial metastases, 6 developed fronto-basal lesions. In our patients, 89% of secondary lesions occurred within less than 3 years after primary diagnosis. 85% of patients with extra-axial tumour spread had been treated with a permanent shunt. Radical tumour resection and radiotherapy with 30 Gy to the neuraxis and 20 Gy boost to the posterior fossa was an important prognostic factor in this series. Patients with additional chemotherapy did not benefit significantly from this treatment. We conclude that optimal management of the primary lesions should aim at (i) total resection, (ii) avoid permanent shunting, and (iii) completion of the radiotherapy with inclusion of the medial frontobasal cisterns in the radiotherapeutic regimen. Our analysis suggests that adequate postoperative screening programmes should consist of 3-monthly scans of the neuraxis in the first three postoperative years and 6-monthly scans thereafter.",

METHODS: Seven consecutive patients with definite sCJD underwent a systematic assessment of sleep-wake disturbances, including clinical history, video-polysomnography, and actigraphy. Extent and distribution of neurodegeneration was estimated by brain autopsy in six patients. Western blot analyses enabling classification and quantification of the protease-resistant isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, in thalamus and occipital cortex was available in four patients. RESULTS: Sleep-wake symptoms were observed in all patients, and were prominent in four of them. All patients had severe sleep EEG abnormalities with loss of sleep spindles, very low sleep efficiency, and virtual absence of REM sleep. The correlation between different methods to assess sleep-wake functions (history, polysomnography, actigraphy, videography) was generally poor. Brain autopsy revealed prominent changes in cortical areas, but only mild changes in the thalamus. No mutation of the PRNP gene was found. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, first, the existence of sleep-wake disturbances similar to those reported in fatal familial insomnia in the absence of prominent and isolated thalamic neuronal loss, and second, the need of a multimodal approach for the unambiguous assessment of sleep-wake functions in these patients.",

Some observations suggested that virion-associated p24 is suboptimally detected using Triton X-100-based virus dissociation buffer (kit buffer). A new reagent (SNCR buffer) containing both denaturing and non-denaturing detergents was therefore developed and evaluated. The SNCR buffer increased the measured p24 concentration about 1.5- to 3-fold in HIV-negative plasma reconstituted with purified HIV-1 particles, while not increasing the background. Among 127 samples of HIV-1-positive patients with moderate to high concentrations of HIV-1 RNA the increase was about threefold across the entire concentration range (P < 0.0001). Specificity before neutralization among prospectively tested clinical samples ruled HIV-negative was 828 of 845 (98.0%) for the SNCR buffer and 464 of 479 (96.9%) for kit buffer. Specificity after confirmatory neutralization of reactive samples or a follow-up test was 100% with either buffer. Surprisingly, the SNCR buffer revealed a p24 reactivity in 115 of 187 samples (61.5%) from adult patients exhibiting undetectable HIV-1 RNA below 5 copies/ml for a duration of 6-30 months under HAART (3.7% with kit buffer). The rate of p24 reactivity in these patients did not decrease with duration of HAART. In conclusion, the SNCR buffer improves the detection of particle-associated HIV-1 p24, thereby increasing the measured p24 concentration in samples with medium to high HIV-1 RNA. It also uncovers the presence of a p24 reactivity, whose identity remains to be determined, in a significant fraction of samples with undetectable HIV-1 RNA under long-term HAART.",

        "document": "Title: Measurement of HIV-1 p24 antigen by signal-amplification-boosted ELISA of heat-denatured plasma is a simple and inexpensive alternative to tests for viral RNA.\nAbstract: Assessment of HIV-1 RNA concentration is widely used for monitoring antiretroviral therapies. Tests are, however, expensive and require technically advanced equipment and highly trained personnel. Increasing availability of antiretroviral treatment in resource-poor settings calls for simple and inexpensive virus tests. HIV-1 p24 antigen tests were frequently used before the availability of nucleic acid tests (NAT). Two simple modifications, heat-mediated destruction of test-interfering antibodies and increased sensitivity achieved by signal amplification, have shaped the p24 antigen test into a tool that rivals NAT. This improved p24 antigen test, for which all reagents are available from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, was evaluated in clinical studies in comparison with the most sensitive PCR methods available at a given time. In a prospective study over 4 years, HIV-1 infection among 859 samples from 307 infants born to HIV-positive mothers in Switzerland was detected as sensitively by p24 antigen assay as by PCR for viral DNA or RNA: 100% sensitivity of all methods after 10 days of age; 99.2% diagnostic specificity of p24 after neutralization (RNA, 98.6%). A study conducted in Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) found 123 of 125 samples from 76 PCR-positive infants positive for p24 antigen (sensitivity = 98.7%). In 169 infected Swiss adults with a median CD4+ T-cell count of 140 cells/microliter followed for a median of 2.7 years, p24 at baseline correlated as well as or better than HIV-1 RNA with the ensuing CD4+ T-lymphocyte decline and was independently predictive of progression to clinical AIDS (P = 0.043) and survival (P = 0.032). RNA predicted AIDS (P < 0.005), but not survival (P = 0.19). Another study of first-visit samples from 496 mostly black IVDU in the U.S. with a median CD4+ count of 518 cells/microliter showed equally strong prediction of progression to clinical AIDS for p24 antigen, HIV-1 RNA, and CD4+ T-lymphocyte concentrations at baseline. Treatment-associated changes in p24 and RNA levels in adults and children correlated well in three Swiss studies. The half-life of p24 antigen in the first phase of effective treatment was 1.6 +/- 0.4 days (RNA, 1.7 +/- 0.8). A second, slower decay phase had a half-life of 42 +/- 16 days. One study suggested that a strategy involving a somewhat more frequent testing for p24 antigen permitted detection of viral failures significantly earlier than tests for HIV-1 RNA conducted at 3-month intervals, while at the same time significantly saving on costs. Experience from three studies indicates that the p24 antigen test recognizes viruses of subtypes A-G and O, as well as some recombinant isolates, but leaves open the possibility that some non-B p24 antigens may be suboptimally detected. This improved p24 antigen test provides diagnosis of pediatric HIV infection, prediction of prognosis and treatment monitoring in quality comparable to tests for HIV-1 RNA, but at much lower costs. There is no problem with sample instability and no need for cumbersome nucleic acid extraction. The test is validated for subtype B, but requires further studies for non-B subtypes.",

The introduction of child labor laws can be triggered by skill-biased technological change, which induces parents to choose smaller families.

We identify a (positive) price effect -- where increasing inequality allows innovators to charge higher prices and (negative) market-size effects -- with higher inequality implying smaller markets for new goods and/or a slower transition of new goods into mass markets. It turns out that price effects dominate market-size effects. We also show that a redistribution from the poor to the rich may be Pareto improving for low levels of inequality.",

US federal states share about 50% of their permanent idiosyncratic risk through cross-state capital income flows. While insurance against transitory fluctuations in output is virtually complete, OECD countries do not share any of their permanent idiosyncratic risk. Our results suggest that purely transaction cost based theories cannot explain the home bias, since the potential welfare gains from insurance against permanent shocks would by far outweigh that of insuring against transitory variation. We conclude that permanent and transitory shocks constitute two qualitatively different kinds of risk and that various forms of endogenous market incompleteness may render permanent shocks a lot harder to insure, in particular at the international level.",

We build a macroeconomic model with credit market imperfections and heterogeneous agents to explore the roots and consequences of this type of corruption. We find that credit market imperfections, by generating rents for the incumbent entrepreneurs, create strong incentives for corrupt behavior by state officials. However, non-collusive corruption not only redistributes income from non-officials towards officials but also within the group of potential entrepreneurs. If borrowing is limited, bribes prevent poorer but talented individuals from starting a business. But this is likely to benefit those who may enter anyway; the cost of capital is lower and there is less competition on the goods markets.",

Well informed and educated patients ideally manage to prevent or delay the onset of severe chronic diseases. With respect to erectile dysfunction (ED) this is of importance because ED is considered to herald debilitating cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease. Aim. This survey aimed to assess patient's knowledge about risk factors (RF) for ED and to identify their preferred source of information. Main Outcome Measures. Knowledge of RF for ED and sources used to gather information about ED as reported by patients with ED. Methods. Between July 2004 and June 2006, 126 patients who presented at our outpatient clinic for an assessment of their ED were prospectively evaluated. The patients received a questionnaire about their demographic and socioeconomic circumstances, their strategies to gather information about ED, and their knowledge of specific RF for this disease. The questionnaire was completed by 81 patients (64%). Results. Forty-one patients (51%) could not name one single RF for ED. Three men knew more than three RF. The two most popular sources of information were the Internet and general practitioners. Well-educated patients were significantly better informed than others. Patients using the Internet as source for health information were significantly younger and had a better knowledge about RF for ED compared to those not using the Internet. Conclusions. Patients' knowledge about RF for ED is poor. The Internet seems to be the most useful information source for patients with ED and is predominantly used by younger and better educated patients. Given that ED is considered to be a precursor lesion of severe cardiovascular diseases, patient information and education deserves more attention.",

Given the frequent occurrence of poor dental health in captive animals reported in the literature, one would expect tooth health to be a limiting factor in captivity as well. Additionally, it could be assumed that brachydont (browsing) animals are more susceptible to dental health problems than hypsodont (grazing) animals, given current indications for systematic increased tooth wear in some browsing species. A pilot survey of necropsy reports of adult captive wild ruminants (n=294, 12 species) in one facility was performed in order to test these hypotheses and to calculate the incidence of irregular tooth wear. The overall incidence of irregular tooth wear was 20 %, with a very high proportion of reports that did not mention the teeth at all. In contrast to the expectations, animals with irregular tooth were older than animals that died from other causes, indicating that reaching above-average age was a prerequisite for the development of reported abnormalities in this data set. A grazing species (blackbuck, Antilope cervicapra) was most affected, whereas two browsing species were not. Affected species had been regularly fed on sandy soil, whereas browsers had received feeds from racks, suggesting that husbandry practices are most important for dental health. There was a high proportion of reported serous fat atrophy in animals with irregular tooth wear, suggesting a clinical relevance of the problem. On average, adult individuals of the species investigated reached 41% of the maximum reported lifespan. Although this number appears low, the lack of comparative data from other facilities does not allow to draw conclusions on the adequacy of the husbandry practices used.",

DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 7 cats with diabetes mellitus. Procedures-BGCs generated at home on 2 consecutive days and within 1 week at the clinic were obtained twice. On each occasion, insulin dose, amount of food, and type of food were consistent for all 3 BGCs. Results of curves generated at home were compared with each other and with the corresponding clinic curve. RESULTS: Differences between blood glucose concentration determined after food was withheld (fasting), nadir concentration, time to nadir concentration, maximum concentration, and mean concentration during 12 hours had high coefficients of variation, as did the difference between fasting blood glucose and nadir concentrations and area under the curve of home curves. Differences between home curve variables were not smaller than those between home and clinic curves, indicating large day-to-day variability in both home and clinic curves. Evaluation of the paired home curves led to the same theoretical recommendation for adjustment of insulin dose on 6 of 14 occasions, and evaluation of home and clinic curves resulted in the same recommendation on 14 of 28 occasions. Four of the 6 paired home curves in cats with good glycemic control and 2 of the 8 paired home curves in cats with poor glycemic control led to the same recommendation. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Considerable day-to-day variability was detected in BGCs generated at home. Cats with good glycemic control may have more reproducible curves generated during blood collection at home than cats with poorer control.",

METHODS: tSSEPs were assessed in 297 patients within five standardized time intervals throughout the first year after injury, along with neurological and functional parameters. RESULTS: Roughly 60% of the patients did not show any recordable tSSEP throughout the first year after injury. Approximately 20% had recordable potentials at every assessment stage and showed an improvement of tSSEP parameters over time. In about 10% of the patients, a potential recovered during the first year. In the remaining cases, potentials were inconsistently recordable. All groups showed a similar amount of neurological and functional improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Recordability, latencies and amplitudes of tSSEPs can change over time after SCI. The early recordability of a tSSEP is associated with a favorable functional and neurological status and outcome. In contrast, an initially absent tSSEP is not always associated with a poorer status and outcome but only in those 75% of the patients in whom the potential remains absent. SIGNIFICANCE: This exact description of the spontaneous improvements of neurophysiological, neurological and functional parameters after SCI is an important prerequisite in appraising the efficacy of new interventional therapies.",

The situation gets more complex for Fab fragments and full-sized antibodies: while the disulfide-linked C(L)/C(H) heterodimer shows very limited thermodynamic stability, its unfolding kinetics are very slow. The same is true for Fab fragments, which, due to this kinetic stabilization, appear to be more stable than their thermodynamic stability suggests. However, suboptimal variable domains can be engineered for improved stability and folding efficiency while preserving their antigen-binding specificity and affinity, either by a limited number of point mutations or by grafting their antigen specificity to superior variable domain frameworks.",

The parasite presents a potentially serious agricultural problem and public health risk in endemic areas. The human populations considered to be at highest risk of infection with this zoonotic helminth are people living in rural areas most of whom earn their livelihood wholly or partially through livestock rearing. Here we report on initial results of a community-based study of pigs owned by resource-poor, emerging pig producers from 21 villages in the Eastern Cape Province. Lingual examination (tongue palpation) in live pigs, two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), which detect parasite antigen (B158/B60 Ag-ELISA and HP10 Ag-ELISA) and an enzyme immunotransfer blot (EITB) assay, which detects antiparasite antibody, were used to verify endemicity and estimate apparent prevalence. In the absence of a gold standard true prevalence was obtained, using a Bayesian approach, with a model that uses both available data and prior information. Results indicate that the parasite is indeed present in the study villages and that true prevalence was 64.6%. The apparent prevalences as measured by each of the four tests were: 11.9% for lingual examination, 54.8% for B158/B60 Ag-ELISA, 40.6% for HP10 Ag-ELISA and 33.3% for EITB. This base-line knowledge of the prevalence of T. solium in pigs provides information essential to the design and monitoring of sustainable and appropriate interventions for cysticercosis prevention and control.",

Relative survival and economic analysis in Switzerland over the last 35 years\nAbstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a serious liver disease. The aim of this study was to explore the long-term prognosis of AE patients, the burden of this disease in Switzerland and the cost-effectiveness of treatment. METHODS: Relative survival analysis was undertaken using a national database with 329 patient records. 155 representative cases had sufficient details regarding treatment costs and patient outcome to estimate the financial implications and treatment costs of AE. RESULTS: For an average 54-year-old patient diagnosed with AE in 1970 the life expectancy was estimated to be reduced by 18.2 and 21.3 years for men and women, respectively. By 2005 this was reduced to approximately 3.5 and 2.6 years, respectively. Patients undergoing radical surgery had a better outcome, whereas the older patients had a poorer prognosis than the younger patients. Costs amount to approximately Euro108,762 per patient. Assuming the improved life expectancy of AE patients is due to modern treatment the cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) saved is approximately Euro6,032. CONCLUSIONS: Current treatments have substantially improved the prognosis of AE patients compared to the 1970s. The cost per DALY saved is low compared to the average national annual income. Hence, AE treatment is highly cost-effective in Switzerland.",

Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions for two subgroups of children (children of Swiss and foreign-born mothers) were performed in order to assess the association between predictor variables and caries. RESULTS: 771 children were examined (participation rate 78%; mean age 2.4 years (age range 2.06-2.90 years)). Although the majority (94%) was born in Switzerland, 61% of children had immigrant backgrounds (mother not born in Switzerland). Cavitated teeth (d2mft) were observed in 12.6% of children (95% CI: 10.4-15.1%). Caries including initial lesions (dl2mft) affected 25.3% of children (95% CI: 22.4-28.5%). There were 34 (4.4%) children with severe caries (all maxillary incisors cavitated). For children with caries, the mean d2mft was 4.3 (+/- 2.8). Children with foreign-born mothers (mothers not born in Switzerland) exhibited a significantly higher caries prevalence than those with Swiss-born mothers (17.4% versus 5.0% with d2mft > 0). CONCLUSIONS: Children with foreign-born mothers exhibited significantly higher caries prevalence rates than those with Swiss-born mothers. Poor oral hygiene and night-time bottle use were identified as risk indicators for caries in all children. Further risk indicators identified in children of foreign-born mothers were a preference for sugar-containing non-milk drinks, no pacifier use, child's age and male gender.",

Whereas some studies found that the presence of PDs has adverse effects on the course and treatment of MDD, others have failed to demonstrate this link. These inconsistent findings suggest that specific PD comorbidity might affect the course of MDD by modulating factors that increase the overall risk of depression, including an elevated tendency to perceive stress. To investigate whether the presence of a specific PD cluster was associated with elevated levels of stress appraisal, we administered the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) before and after treatment to 227 MDD outpatients enrolled in an 8-week open-label treatment with fluoxetine. Following treatment, multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the presence of Cluster A, but not Cluster B or C, was associated with higher levels of perceived stress, even after adjusting for baseline depression severity and PSS scores, as well as various sociodemographic variables. The presence of Cluster A PD comorbidity was uniquely associated with elevated stress appraisal after antidepressant treatment, raising the possibility that stress exacerbation might be an important factor linked to poor treatment outcome in MDD subjects with Cluster A pathology.",

The Health Maintenance Organization (U.S.) and the gatekeeper model (the Netherlands) score 10 and 9 out of 15 points, respectively, importantly due to a market-oriented environment. By way of contrast, the so-called \u2018structured treatment programs\u2019 of the German health care system score only 4 out of 15 points. Not only the more tightly regulated environment but also the lack of consideration of consumer preferences and of incentives for service providers to participate in the programs contributed to poor performance.",

Furthermore, results associating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA)-activity with sleep EEG measurements in children are missing. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate in preschool-children the association between sleep patterns and endocrine activity. Furthermore, children's behavioral/emotional difficulties and competences were assessed in order to correlate psychological strain with sleep measures.\r\nParticipants and methods: Sixty-seven kindergarten children (35 boys and 32 girls) aged 5.34 underwent EEG-monitoring for one night. For baseline HPA-activity assessment, saliva samples were collected immediately after awakening, whereas saliva samples before, while and after a psychological challenge were used to assess the HPA-activity under stress conditions.\r\nResults: Compared to girls, boys showed significantly more REM sleep time. After cluster analysis, children labeled as 'poor' sleepers (n=27; 40,30%) showed significantly increased morning cortisol values, as compared to 'good' sleepers (n=22; 32,83%). Furthermore, increased cortisol AUC values under stress conditions were significantly associated with an elevated number of awakenings after sleep onset, and more sleep time in stages 1 and 2. In addition, an increased sleep efficiency was significantly correlated with self-reported emotional/behavioral difficulties, i.e. with low degrees of impulsivity (r=-.31; p<.05) and lower degrees of social inhibition and peer victimiziation (r=-.26, p<.05). \r\nConclusions: Our results underlined that already in preschool years, associations between objectively examined unfavorable sleep patterns, increased HPA-system activity and more difficult behavioral and psychosocial dimensions may be observed.",

Prognosis is poor. Using a series of 214 GBM patients, we observed an effect of the variant 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) c.677C>T on overall survival. This effect was strongest in patients younger than 60 years at diagnosis (overall survival, median +/- SE: genotype CC, 13 +/- 1 months; CT, 11 +/- 2 months; TT, 7 +/- 3 months; multivariate Cox regression analysis, Wald = 8.58, p = 0.007). In addition, the MTHFR genotype significantly influenced the overall survival of patients with a postoperative Karnofsky score >70 (CC, 12 +/- 2 months; CT, 11 +/- 1 months; TT, 10 +/- 4 months; Wald = 5.89, p = 0.015).

Therefore we compared 31 preterm patients with disrupted cerebellar development to a control group of 31 gender and gestational age matched premature infants with normal cerebellar development. Supratentorial brain injuries during the neonatal period were comparable between the groups. At a minimum age of 24 months motor and mental development was assessed by standardized tests. Disrupted cerebellar development was associated with significantly poorer scores both in the subtests for neuromotor (p < 0.001) and mental development (p < 0.001), respectively. Mixed CP was diagnosed in 48% of affected patients, whereas none of the patients of the control group had mixed CP. Microcephaly and epilepsy were significantly related to disrupted cerebellar development. Preterm patients with disrupted cerebellar development exhibit poorer outcome results in all investigated variables. The role of the cerebellum in neurodevelopment after prematurity seems to be underestimated so far.",

METHOD: Twenty-six subjects (14 volunteers, 12 patients) underwent multiple breathhold 2D balanced turbo-field echo cine CMR in addition to k-t SENSE accelerated 3D imaging (acceleration factor 5; 5x k-t SENSE), performed before and after administration of a high-relaxivity gadolinium-based contrast agent (Gadobutrolum). k-t acceleration factors of 7 and 10 were also assessed in six volunteers. Left ventricular end diastolic volume (EDV), end systolic volume (ESV), mass, and ejection fraction (EF) were calculated for each method. RESULTS: There was at least moderate agreement between the EDV, ESV, mass and EF calculated by 2D and 3D 5x k-t SENSE methods before contrast (concordance coefficients 0.92, 0.95, 0.97, 0.92, respectively). Agreement improved following contrast (concordance coefficients 0.97, 0.99, 0.98, 0.93, respectively). The 3D method underestimated all parameters compared to 2D (mean bias pre-contrast 6.1 ml, 0.6 ml, 3.5 g, 2.0% respectively). 3D image quality scores were significantly poorer than 2D, showing a non-significant trend to improvement following contrast administration. Parameters derived with k-t acceleration factors of 7 and 10 showed poorer agreement with 2D values. CONCLUSION: Left ventricular volumes and mass are reliably assessed using 3D 5x k-t SENSE accelerated CMR. Contrast administration further improves agreement between 5x k-t SENSE and 2D-derived measurements. k-t acceleration factors greater than 5, though feasible, produce poorer agreement with 2D values.",

In many countries, governments aim to fill the resulting gap with subsidized private pensions. This paper exploits the recent German pension reform to shed new light on the uptake of voluntary, but heavily subsidized private pension schemes. Specifically, we investigate how the uptake of the recently\r\nintroduced \u201cRiester pensions\u201d depends on state-provided saving incentives, and how well the targeting to families and low-income households works in practice.\r\nWe show that, after a slow start, private pension plans took off very quickly. While saving incentives were effective in reaching parents, they were less successful in attracting low-income earners, although Riester pensions exhibit a more equal pattern by income than occupational pensions and unsubsidized private pension plans.\r\nWe also provide circumstantial evidence on displacement effects between saving for old-age provision and other purposes. Households who plan to purchase housing are less likely to have a Riester pension. The same holds for households who attach high importance to a bequest motive. Occupational pensions and other forms of private pensions, however, act as complements rather than as substitutes.",

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed clinical and laboratory findings of all patients diagnosed at our institution from 1995 to 2004 with cardiomyopathy within their first year of life. RESULTS: Of the 35 patients, cardiomyopathy was classified as dilated in 18, hypertrophic in 14 and unclassified in 3. The aetiologies were genetic syndromes (8), metabolic diseases (5), familial isolated cardiomyopathy (3) and myopathy (1). During a median follow-up of 1.5 years (range 0-9 years), 13 patients died from progressive heart failure and two underwent heart transplants. Estimated survival and freedom from transplant was 69, 66, 58 and 50% after 0.5, 1, 2 and 6 years, respectively. Patients with severe heart failure symptoms within the first month of life had significantly worse outcomes than patients without heart failure symptoms. CONCLUSION: High morbidity and poor prognosis result through progressive heart failure. Aetiology and clinical course are especially heterogeneous in infants. The most commonly identified aetiologies are genetic syndromes and metabolic diseases. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for defining the aetiology and developing individual treatment strategies.",

Suicidality was assessed in an independent interview section. MDE was diagnosed by DSM-III-R criteria.\r\nResults: The weighted lifetime prevalence for suicide attempts was 6.3% (women 7.7%, men 4.9%). 50 of 72 (69%) subjects attempting suicide were diagnosed with MDE and another 18% with minor affective disorders. But only 23.8% of 101 major depressives and only 28.1% of bipolar-II subjects attempted suicide. Compared to others, subjects attempting suicide were in their personality often depressed, with low self-esteem and mastery and high neuroticism scores. In addition they were more irritable/impulsive and aggressive towards others and manifested more conduct problems at school age and higher rates of antisocial personality disorders. Among subjects with MDE most of these findings were replicated, but the differences to non-suicidal subjects were smaller than to controls.\r\nConclusions: The majority of depressives do not attempt suicide. About 25% of subjects suffering from depression had attempted suicide by the age of 40. These subjects were characterised by a combination of externalising (impulsivity, aggression, conduct problems) and internalising characteristics (depressive personality, high neuroticism, poor coping skills and low self-esteem).\r\n\r\nKey words: suicide attempts, personality, major depressive episodes, epidemiology",

METHOD: Two-hundred and twelve adolescent patients first admitted for in-patient treatment, aged 10-18 (Mean 14.9) years and 94.8% female, were followed-up for an average of 8.3 years after first admission at sites in (former East and West Berlin, Zurich, Sofia, and Bucharest). Clinical history data were collected by use of standardized item-sheets at first admission. Semi-structured interviews including ratings of eating pathology and psychosocial outcome were performed at follow-up. RESULTS: About 44.8% (95/212) of the patients required at least one readmission. Rates of rehospitalization were significantly higher at the Eastern sites (Sofia and Bucharest). Significant predictors of readmission were paternal alcoholism, history of anorexia nervosa in the family, eating disorder in infancy, periodic overactivity, lower weight increase at first admission, and lower BMI at first discharge. In a model of logistic regression analysis, five variables (paternal alcoholism, eating disorder in infancy, periodic overactivity, low weight increase during first admission, and low BMI at first discharge) correctly classified 69% of the participants into cases with single or repeated admissions. Patients with repeated admissions had a less favorable long term outcome and had higher rates of persisting psychopathology at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Rehospitalization reflects the chronic course in a sizable proportion of adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa. Family psychopathology may have an effect both in terms of genetic vulnerability and environmental stress leading to unfavorable courses. The strong effect of insufficient weight gain during first admission and lower BMI at first discharge emphasizes the importance of adequate interventions. Readmissions carry the risk for later poor psychosocial and psychiatric outcomes.",

These findings, however, mainly apply to the \"average\" trend for transplant patients. This study aims to investigate whether transplant patients fall into different groups in good or poor psychosocial outcome after organ transplantation. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one patients were assessed before and 6, 12, and 24 months after a heart, lung, liver, kidney, or bone-marrow transplant. Cluster analysis was applied to identify typical outcome profiles of the patients' mental health (SF-36); differences between the clusters were investigated with regard to further psychosocial parameters (sense of coherence, optimism, psychosocial functioning, anxiety, depression, life/health satisfaction, medication experience). RESULTS: The analysis revealed two clusters of transplant patients. Cluster A (n=78, 59.5%) showed a fairly good psychosocial outcome, improving over the posttransplant period of 2 years. Cluster B (n=53, 40.5%) included patients who reported a limited or poor outcome, deteriorating after the transplant. Furthermore, there are significant differences between clusters A and B in psychosocial parameters and physical functioning. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the experience of the transplant process may vary greatly from patient to patient, and that a considerable number of transplant recipients require psychosocial support, despite the majority of patients showing an unquestionable posttransplant improvement in psychosocial well-being.",

Evidence from the Swiss Federal system\nAbstract: This article analyses the relationship between decentralization and the extent of fiscal discipline in the Swiss cantons between 1984 and 2000. From a theoretical point of view, decentralization and federalism can be associated with both an expansive and a dampening effect on government debt. On the one hand, decentralized structures have been argued to lead to a reduction of debt due to inherent competition between the member states and the multitude of veto positions which restrict public intervention. On the other hand, decentralization has been claimed to contribute to an increase of public debt as it involves expensive functional and organizational duplications as well as cost-intensive, often debt-financed, compromise solutions between a large number of actors that operate in an uncoordinated and contradictory way. Our empirical results show that in periods of prosperous economic development, the architecture of state structure has no impact on debt. However, the degree of decentralization influences debt in economically poor times: In phases of economic recession, administratively decentralized cantons implement a more economical budgetary policy than centralized Swiss member states.",

        "document": "Title: Magnesium sulfate in the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-adapted trial\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that high-dose MgSO4 therapy is safe and reduces the incidence of DIND and subsequent poor outcome after SAH. We intended to assess the safety and efficacy of high-dose MgSO4 therapy after SAH as means to prevent DIND and to evaluate the impact on clinical outcome. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study. The MgSO4 infusion was adjusted every 12 hours until day 12 according to the target serum Mg2+ level. The occurrence of DIND, secondary infarction, side effects, and the outcome after 3 and 12 months were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were randomized; 27 received placebo and 31 MgSO4. The difference in occurrence of DIND and secondary infarction was not significant. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a trend toward better outcome (P = .083) after 3 months. On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after 3 months (P = .017) and a trend toward better outcome after 1 year (P = .083). Significantly more often hypotension (P = .040) and hypocalcemia (P = .005) occurred as side effects in the treatment group. In 16 patients (52%), the MgSO4 therapy had to be stopped before day 12 because of side effects. No predictive factor leading to termination was found in a postrandomization analysis. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MgSO4 therapy might be efficient as a prophylactic adjacent therapy after SAH to reduce the risk for poor outcome. Nevertheless, because of the high frequency of the side effects, patients should be observed in an intensive or intermediate care setting.",

We investigated these proteins in two International Breast Cancer Study Group trials studying node-negative early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Trial VIII compared chemotherapy followed by goserelin with either modality alone in premenopausal patients. Trial IX compared chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal patients. Central Pathology Office assessed p27 and Skp2 expression in the primary tumor by immunohistochemistry among 1631 (60%) trial patients. RESULTS: p27 and Skp2 were inversely related; 13% of tumors expressed low p27 and high Skp2. Low p27 and high Skp2 were associated with unfavorable prognostic factors including larger size and higher grade tumors, absence of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression and high Ki-67 (each P < 0.05). Low p27 and high Skp2 were not associated with disease-free survival (P = 0.42 and P = 0.48, respectively). The relative effects of chemo-endocrine versus endocrine therapy were similar regardless of p27 or Skp2. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the association of low p27 and high Skp2 with other poor prognostic features, but found no predictive or prognostic value, and therefore do not recommend routine determination of p27 and Skp2 for node-negative breast cancer.",

However, there continue to be a small group that does not realize such a benefit. In an effort to identify possible predictors for this, we have compared pre- and postimplant audiologic data using Hearing In Noise Test (HINT), City University of New York (CUNY), or Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) scores for 445 consecutive English-speaking adult patients followed for a minimum of 1 year postimplantation in two distinct groups, poor versus excellent performers. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. METHODS: Poor performers were those who realized a worsening, no improvement, or an improvement of less than 10%. This group numbered 58 (13%). High performers consisted of a cadre of 194 (44%) patients who scored between 91 and 100% postimplantation. Demographic data relating to onset of deafness, education exposure, etiology, etc., were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the poor performers, 33 (57%) were pre-/perilingually deafened. Of these, 79% had not received any auditory/oral training in childhood. On the other hand, a total of 109 implant recipients were individuals who were pre-/perilingually deafened. Of these, 24 were in the excellent performer category. All were identified early and were recipients of a strong auditory/oral education. Of the high performers, 170 (88%) were deafened late. Other findings such as preoperative electronystagmography with caloric testing, hearing aid use, device type, and high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone will be discussed for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A high preimplant speech score, auditory verbal therapy, and postlingual deafness statistically correlate with higher postimplant speech scores 1 year after cochlear implantation. Device type, caloric response and hearing aid use preimplantation, age at surgery, and sex do not statistically correlate with either poor or excellent speech discrimination scores postcochlear implantation.",

DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature METHODS: We conducted an electronic database search in seven databases in August 2005 and also hand-searched the bibliographies of studies that we selected for the review.Two reviewers independently screened and selected all randomized controlled trials that compare the effects of conventional therapy plus Motor Imagery to those of only conventional therapy on stroke patients.The outcome measurements were: Fugl-Meyer Stroke Assessment upper extremity score (66 points) and Action Research Arm Test upper extremity score (57 points).Due to the high variability in the outcomes, we could not pool the data statistically. RESULTS: We identified four randomized controlled trials from Asia and North America. The quality of the included studies was poor to moderate. Two different Motor imagery techniques were used (three studies used audiotapes and one study had occupational therapists apply the intervention). Two studies found significant effects of Motor Imagery in the Fugl-Meyer Stroke Assessment: Differences between groups amounted to 11.0 (1.0 to 21.0) and 3.2 (-4 to 10.3) respectively and in the Action Research Arm Test 6.1 (-6.2 to 18.4) and 15.8 (0.5 to 31.0) respectively. One study did not find a significant effect in the Fugl-Meyer Stroke Assessment and Color trail Test (p = 0.28) but in the task-related outcomes (p > 0.001). CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that Motor imagery provides additional benefits to conventional physiotherapy or occupational therapy. However, larger and methodologically sounder studies should be conducted to assess the benefits of Motor imagery.",

Based on promising results of a pilot study, we initiated a phase II study with WBH and carboplatin in pretreated patients with advanced ovarian cancer to investigate the toxicity and efficacy of WBH in combination with carboplatin. METHODS: 47 patients with histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian carcinoma were enrolled in the study. Patients were pretreated with at least one palliative chemotherapy regimen. Of 47 patients 24 were classified as platinum refractory or resistant and 16 as platinum sensitive. RESULTS: Main toxicity was hematological with grade 3/4 anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occurring in 49%, 49% and 65%, respectively. Cardiac complications occurred with grade 1/2 in 22 of 47 (47%) patients and with grade 3 in 1 patient (2%). In 35 patients evaluable for response, the overall response rate was 45% [CR: 4/35 (11%), PR: 12/35 (34%), NC: 9/35 (26%]. In platinum refractory and resistant patients we observed CR in 6%, PR in 24% and NC in 24%. The median overall survival and progression free survival were 61.5 weeks and 29 weeks, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that WBH in combination with carboplatin is an active salvage treatment option in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. However, significant hematological toxicity has to be considered and renders this regimen less suitable for palliative care setting. There is no evidence yet, that whole-body hyperthermia contributes to any clinical improvement beyond chemotherapy alone. This question can only be addressed in a randomized phase III trial.",

        "document": "Title: Targeted therapeutic approach for an anaplastic thyroid cancer in vitro and in vivo\nAbstract: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is among the most aggressive human malignancies, being responsible for the majority of thyroid cancer-related deaths. Despite multimodal therapy including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, the outcome of ATC is poor. The human ATC cell line MB1, derived from tumor tissue of a 57-year-old man with thyroid cancer and pronounced neutrophilia, was established from surgically excised tumor tissue. The karyotype of the cell line shows many chromosomal abnormalities. Preclinical investigations have shown antitumor activity and effectiveness of the BRAF kinase inhibitor Sorafenib and the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib. After establishment of the MB1 cell line these agents were applied in vitro and, showing activity in a cell culture model, were also used for in vivo treatment. Sorafenib had some clinical effect, namely normalization of leucocytosis, but had no sustained impact on subsequent tumor growth and development of distant metastasis. Molecular diagnostics of the tumor demonstrated no BRAF mutations in exons 11 and 15 concordant with a rather modest effect of Sorafenib on MB1 cell growth. Clinical benefit was seen with subsequent bortezomib therapy inducing a temporary halt to lymph node growth and a progression-free interval of 7 weeks. Our observations together with previous data from preclinical models could serve as a rationale for selecting those patients suffering from ATC most likely to benefit from targeted therapy. A prospective controlled randomized trial integrating kinase and proteasome inhibitors into a therapeutic regime for ATC is warranted.",

        "document": "Title: Methods of prediction and prevention of pre-eclampsia: systematic reviews of accuracy and effectiveness literature with economic modelling\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the accuracy of predictive tests for pre-eclampsia and the effectiveness of preventative interventions for pre-eclampsia. Also to assess the cost-effectiveness of strategies (test-intervention combinations) to predict and prevent pre-eclampsia. DATA SOURCES: Major electronic databases were searched to January 2005 at least. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews were carried out for test accuracy and effectiveness. Quality assessment was carried out using standard tools. For test accuracy, meta-analyses used a bivariate approach. Effectiveness reviews were conducted under the auspices of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group and used standard Cochrane review methods. The economic evaluation was from an NHS perspective and used a decision tree model. RESULTS: For the 27 tests reviewed, the quality of included studies was generally poor. Some tests appeared to have high specificity, but at the expense of compromised sensitivity. Tests that reached specificities above 90% were body mass index greater than 34, alpha-foetoprotein and uterine artery Doppler (bilateral notching). The only Doppler test with a sensitivity of over 60% was resistance index and combinations of indices. A few tests not commonly found in routine practice, such as kallikreinuria and SDS-PAGE proteinuria, seemed to offer the promise of high sensitivity, without compromising specificity, but these would require further investigation. For the 16 effectiveness reviews, the quality of included studies was variable. The largest review was of antiplatelet agents, primarily low-dose aspirin, and included 51 trials (36,500 women). This was the only review where the intervention was shown to prevent both pre-eclampsia and its consequences for the baby. Calcium supplementation also reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia, but with some uncertainty about the impact on outcomes for the baby. The only other intervention associated with a reduction in RR of pre-eclampsia was rest at home, with or without a nutritional supplement, for women with normal blood pressure. However, this review included just two small trials and its results should be interpreted with caution. The cost of most of the tests was modest, ranging from 5 pounds for blood tests such as serum uric acid to approximately 20 pounds for Doppler tests. Similarly, the cost of most interventions was also modest. In contrast, the best estimate of additional average cost associated with an average case of pre-eclampsia was high at approximately 9000 pounds. The results of the modelling revealed that prior testing with the test accuracy sensitivities and specificities identified appeared to offer little as a way of improving cost-effectiveness. Based on the evidence reviewed, none of the tests appeared sufficiently accurate to be clinically useful and the results of the model favoured no-test/treat-all strategies. Rest at home without any initial testing appeared to be the most cost-effective 'test-treatment' combination. Calcium supplementation to all women, without any initial testing, appeared to be the second most cost-effective. The economic model provided little support that any form of Doppler test has sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be cost-effective for the early identification of pre-eclampsia. It also suggested that the pattern of cost-effectiveness was no different in high-risk mothers than the low-risk mothers considered in the base case. CONCLUSIONS: The tests evaluated are not sufficiently accurate, in our opinion, to suggest their routine use in clinical practice. Calcium and antiplatelet agents, primarily low-dose aspirin, were the interventions shown to prevent pre-eclampsia. The most cost-effective approach to reducing pre-eclampsia is likely to be the provision of an effective, affordable and safe intervention applied to all mothers without prior testing to assess levels of risk. It is probably premature to suggest the implementation of a treat-all intervention strategy at present, however the feasibility and acceptability of this to women could be explored. Rigorous evaluation is needed of tests with modest cost whose initial assessments suggest that they may have high levels of both sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, there is a need for high-quality, adequately powered randomised controlled trials to investigate whether interventions such as advice to rest are indeed effective in reducing pre-eclampsia. In future, an economic model should be developed that considers not just pre-eclampsia, but other related outcomes, particularly those relevant to the infant such as perinatal death, preterm birth and small for gestational age. Such a modelling project should make provision for primary data collection on the safety of interventions and their associated costs.",

However, the relevance of HER3 with regard to its prognostic significance and function in primary melanoma and metastases remains largely elusive. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HER3 protein expression was analyzed immunohistochemically using tissue microarrays of 130 primary melanoma and 87 metastases relative to established clinical variables. The possibility of an influence of HER3 on melanoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was studied in human melanoma cell lines. RESULTS: We show that HER3 is frequently expressed in malignant melanoma and metastases at elevated levels. High HER3 expression may serve as a prognostic marker because it correlates with cell proliferation, tumor progression, and reduced patient survival. Suppression of HER3 expression by RNA interference reduces melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. In addition, down-regulation of HER3 synergistically enhances dacarbazine-induced apoptosis. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies specific for the extracellular portion of HER3 efficiently block heregulin-induced proliferation, migration, and invasion of melanoma cell lines. CONCLUSION: Our results provide novel insights into the role of HER3 in melanoma and point out new possibilities for therapeutic intervention.",

Ischial fractures seemed more debilitating with two of five resulting in painful nonunions for which additional surgery was performed. In contrast, only one patient with pubic fracture had additional surgery. Ischial fractures took almost twice as long to achieve resolution of symptoms compared with pubic fractures, and when left untreated, asymptomatic nonunions developed in three of five. However, we observed no effect on acetabular fragment positioning or long-term clinical outcome. It is essential to be aware of this potential complication and realize it could be accompanied by substantial morbidity for patients during the rehabilitation period after periacetabular osteotomy, but does not seem to influence the longer-term outcome.

One-hundred and fifty-eight complete data sets were available for evaluation. Mean differences between patient and surgeon measurements were 18 degrees +/- 19 degrees . While mean values for most degrees of freedom were similar between patient and surgeon measurements, some rotational movements were overestimated by patients. Correlation of patient and surgeon based assessments were poor for all degrees of freedom (r(2) <or= .52). Dominance (right/left handed), gender, age, pathology, pain, and subjective shoulder value did not significantly impact on the correlation. Combining surgeon and patient based information in the same study is inappropriate. Comparisons and meta-analysis of shoulder studies need to take the type of data acquisition into account.",

That is, the diagnosis is made when the individual\u2019s achievement or ability in arithmetic is significantly below that expected for age, schooling, and level of intelligence. This disorder is conceptualized as a hereditary disorder, being present from early childhood, and is not the result of poor or inappropriate schooling, cultural factors or medical conditions (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; WHO, 1996), although these latter conditions can aggravate any learning disability. Although this widely accepted definition appears plausible, findings from recent years require reconsideration firstly of the way DD is defined and secondly of diagnostic criteria.",

In this case-control study in 48 asthmatic and 20 healthy children, we aimed to characterize the baseline profile of the inflammatory mediators cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), 9(alpha)11(beta)PGF(2), PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), 8-isoprostane (8-iso-PGF(2alpha)) within EBC in asthmatic compared with healthy children using new methods. In addition, we investigated their relation to other inflammatory markers. The assessment included collection of EBC, measurement of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO)) and evaluation of urinary excretion of leukotriene E(4.) cysLTs were measured directly in EBC by radioimmunoassay and prostanoids were measured using gas chromatography negative-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Only cysLT levels were significantly higher in asthmatic compared with healthy children (p = 0.002). No significant differences in cysLTs were found between steroid na\u00efve and patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids. In contrast, FE(NO) was significantly higher in steroid na\u00efve compared with steroid-treated asthmatic and healthy children (p = 0.04 and 0.024, respectively). The diagnostic accuracy of cysLTs in EBC for asthma was 73.6% for the whole group and 78.2% for steroid-na\u00efve asthmatic children. The accuracy to classify asthmatic for FE(NO) was poor (62.9%) for the whole group, but improved to 79.9% when only steroid-na\u00efve asthmatic children were taken into consideration. cysLTs in EBC is an inflammatory marker which distinguishes asthmatics, as a whole group, from healthy children.",

The significance of other molecular prognostic factors in this subgroup is unclear. Karyopherin alpha2 (KPNA2) has been reported as an important factor of tumorgenesis and progression of breast cancer. The aim of present study was to evaluate the impact of KPNA2 expression on prognosis of patients with high risk breast cancer (HRBC) and response intensive chemotherapy within the randomized WSG-AM-01 trial. KPNA2 nuclear expression (>10% vs. <10% of nuclei) was measured by immunohistochemistry on tissue arrays of 191 patients randomized to tandem high dose vs. conventional dose-dense chemotherapy in HRBC with >9 positive lymph nodes and correlated with clinical outcome (median follow-up of 63.3 months) by Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox hazard model analysis, including, molecular subtypes determined by k-clustering (k = 5). KPNA2 overexpression (n = 74, 39%) significantly correlated with shorter event-free and overall survival (OS) in both therapy arms by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that the overexpression of KPNA2 was an independent prognostic factor of decreased OS HR = 1.86 [95% CI: 1.07-3.23, p = 0.03]. This predictive value was independent of basal-like/Her-2/neu subtypes, significantly associated with KPNA2 and was addressed particularly to G2 tumors. Our data suggest the use of KPNA2 nuclear expression as novel prognostic marker in node-positive patients, especially in determination of G2 tumors in 2 subgroups of different prognosis. KPNA2 expression may be also considered as a marker for global chemoresistance, which can not be overcome by conventional dose-modification of chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer.",

It affects predominantly women with marked impairment in daily life activities. Its aetiopathogenesis is well described, while its treatment still controversial. The authors report their experience with 400 consecutive patients with established clinical and radiological findings of carpometacarpal joint arthritis treated by suspension arthroplasty with Ceruso's modified Weilby's technique. At 12 months follow-up, we were able to assess 315 patients using MAYO's score pre- and post-operatively, obtaining 86 excellent results, 134 good, 62 fair and 33 poor. As for complications, there were seven infections, 32 persistent pain and 42 limited range of motion. According to our experience the treatment modality of suspension arthroplasty with Ceruso's modified Weilby's technique represents the procedure of choice in indicated cases of first carpometacarpal joint arthritis in advanced stages according to Eaton-Littler classification.",

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 14 patients identified and treated in Alberta between 1974 and 1999. Overall and disease-specific survival were the most important outcomes of interest. RESULTS: The average age was 43 years. The maxilla was the most common primary site. The majority of the patients received surgical treatment in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy. Disease-specific survival was 42% at 2 years and 30.1% at 5 years. Four patients developed osteosarcomas in the field of previous radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Osteosarcoma of the head and neck is very aggressive. In our series, mostly high-grade malignancy affected a middle-aged population. Surgical resection is difficult owing to anatomic restraints, and adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered in most patients. The series is notable for the poor outcome, with a 5-year actuarial survival of 30%. This may reflect the lack of a standardized treatment protocol.",

Methods Cross sectional ultrasound study of 3126 human subjects to determine the extent of human cystic and alveolar echinococcosis (AE). Blood samples were taken from each subject and analysed for antibodies against Echinococcus, Toxocara and Toxoplasma spp. Each subject was questioned about possible risk factors that might be associated with zoonotic transmission. Analysis employed a mixed modelling approach based on the results of the ultrasound study, the serological results and the results of the questionnaire. Bayesian techniques were employed to estimate diagnostic performance. A helminthological study of the local dog population was also undertaken. Results A total of 23 subjects tested positive for CE on ultrasound and a further three individuals had strong serological evidence of infection. Another 24 reported treatment for CE. Ultrasound lesions or treatment for CE were associated with poverty. No ultrasound evidence of AE was found, but one individual had strong serological evidence of exposure to Echinococcus multilocularis. Toxoplasma seropositivity (16%; 504 individuals) increased with age. Household level Toxoplasma-seropositivity was associated with unsafe drinking water. Toxocara seropositivity (11%; 349 individuals) was more frequent in children and in individuals who disposed of dog faeces on the vegetable garden. A purgation study of dogs indicated that 13% of dogs in the community were infected with Echinococcus granulosus, 5% with E. multilocularis and 2% with Toxocara canis respectively. Conclusions There is significant transmission of E. granulosus to humans in this community. Transmission may be associated with poverty. There is little evidence of E. multilocularis transmission to humans, despite the presence in the parasite in the domestic dog population. Toxoplasma is actively transmitted and there is evidence for transmission by the water supply. Children are at highest risk of exposure to Toxocara",

Here we have examined acquisition and performance of a bilateral obstacle stepping task to see whether these difficulties are also present during bipedal movements. Subjects had to minimize foot clearance when repeatedly stepping on a treadmill over randomly approaching obstacles on either side. The subjects had full vision and received acoustic feedback information about task performance. Foot clearance improved in healthy and PD subjects during the acquisition of the task. However, PD subjects showed a slower improvement and achieved a poorer performance level. Thus, in contrast to unilateral obstacle stepping, where no deficits in performance after task repetition were found in PD subjects, bilateral obstacle stepping was poorer in these subjects compared to healthy subjects. The present results extend findings from upper to lower limb movements, namely that PD subjects have difficulties in the performance of bilateral motor tasks.",

The combination of the surgical approach, pre-existing pulmonary disorders, poor nutritional status and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines may be contributing factors. N-acetylcysteine ((NAC) has been shown to have oxygen scavenging abilities. In severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, positive effects of NAC on morbidity and mortality were discovered. In this observational study peri-operative high dose NAC was administered in 22 patients. The effects of this treatment on respiratory function, morbidity and survival were studied. These prospectively collected data were compared with data of a matched, retrospective group without NAC treatment. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of socio-demographic data, preoperative pulmonary function, intra-operative course and oncologic characteristics. The oxygenation indices at the postoperative hours 2 (P = 0.019), 4 (P < 0.001), 8 (P = 0.035), 12 (P = 0.035) and 24 (P = 0.046) were significantly higher in the NAC group. After 36 h, the difference between groups was no longer significant (P = 0.064). NAC-treated patients showed significant lower overall pulmonary morbidity, 45.5% versus 81.8% (P = 0.027). Surgical morbidity, intensive care unit and hospital stay were not significantly different between groups, mortality was zero. Kaplan-Meier curves showed no significant difference in survival 12 months postoperatively. These data indicate that postoperative oxygenation can be improved and rate of overall pulmonary complications is reduced using peri-operative high dose NAC in transthoracic esophagectomy.",

In certain socio-demographic categories, up to 30% showed such work-life conflict (WLC). For both genders, work-life imbalance turned out to be a risk factor affecting mental health. Employees with self-reported WLC presented a significantly higher relative risk for poor self-rated health (women: aOR = 2.6/men: aOR = 2.0), negative emotions and depression (aOR = 3.0/3.1), low energy and optimism (aOR = 2.1/1.6), fatigue (aOR = 2.4/2.6), and sleep disorders (aOR = 1.8/1.5) compared to employees with no WLC. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Internationally, few data on the prevalence of WLC exist. In Switzerland, work-life imbalance is not a marginal phenomenon among the workforce and needs to be addressed as a notable public and mental health issue.",

Severe and intermediate alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (serum levels <11 and 11-20 micromol.L(-1), respectively) increase the risk of COPD in active smokers. However, little is known about the interaction of severe and intermediate AAT deficiency with modifiable COPD risk factors other than active smoking. In this study, a MEDLINE search was carried out for studies investigating the combined effect of environmental inhalants (occupation and passive smoking) and AAT deficiency in the lung. A total of 18 studies using established methods for the assessment of AAT deficiency were included in this review. Occupational exposures and passive smoking affected lung function decline or prevalence of respiratory symptoms in four out of five studies investigating subjects with severe AAT deficiency, and in eight out of 13 studies with a focus on intermediate AAT deficiency. While study designs mostly prohibited formal assessment of effect modification, an interaction between intermediate AAT deficiency and passive smoking was identified in two studies with children. Additional study limitations included small sample size, poor adjustment for confounding and misclassification of environmental exposure as well as AAT activity. In conclusion, population-based epidemiological studies with associated biobanks are needed to identify gene-environment interactions and population subgroups susceptible to alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.",

Findings from a multisite study\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The relevance of repeated body mass index (BMI) assessments for long-term outcome in anorexia nervosa (AN) was studied. METHOD: Two-hundred and twelve adolescent patients aged 10-18 (Mean 14.9) years from five sites were followed up for an average of 8.3 years after first admission. Various predictors of BMI at follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: In comparison to subjects with normal BMI (>17.5) at final follow-up, subjects with BMI <17.5 had significantly lower age-adjusted BMI prior to onset of the disorder and at discharge from first admission. In addition, all outcome scores indicated poorer functioning in the group with BMI < 17.5. The BMI prior to onset of AN, the BMI at first hospital admission and discharge, and the BMI at final follow up were significantly correlated across time. Higher BMI prior to onset of AN, higher BMI at first discharge, and lower age at first admission predicted a normal BMI (>17.5) at follow-up in a model of logistic regression. CONCLUSION: The long-term outcome of adolescent AN reflects the normal tracking of BMI over time. Presumably, the tracking in AN patients is somewhat reduced in comparison to healthy subjects.",

METHODS: Ten restorative materials, eight composites (BelleGlass, Chromasit, Estenia, Heliomolar RO, SureFil, Targis cured at 95 and 130 degrees C, Tetric Ceram) an amalgam (Amalcap) and a ceramic (Empress) have been evaluated with regard to the wear with five different wear methods (IVOCLAR, ZURICH, MUNICH, OHSU, ACTA). Every center received specimens, which Ivoclar Vivadent had made using the same batch. The test centers did not know which brand they were testing. After completion of the wear test, the raw data were sent to IVOCLAR for further analysis. The statistical analysis of the data included logarithmic transformation of the data, the calculation of relative ranks of each material within each test center, measures of agreement between methods, the discrimination power and coefficient of variation of each method as well as measures of the consistency and global performance for each material. RESULTS: Relative ranks of the materials varied tremendously between the test centers. When all materials were taken into account and the test methods compared with each other, only ACTA agreed reasonably well with two other methods, i.e. OHSU and ZURICH. On the other hand, MUNICH did not agree with the other methods at all. The ZURICH method showed the lowest discrimination power, ACTA and IVOCLAR the highest. Materialwise, the best global performance was achieved by Empress, which was clearly ahead of BelleGlass, SureFil and Estenia. In contrast, Heliomolar RO, Tetric Ceram and especially Chromasit demonstrated a poor global performance. The best consistency was achieved by BelleGlass and SureFil, whereas the consistency of Amalcap and Heliomolar RO was poor. SIGNIFICANCE: As the different wear simulator settings measure different wear mechanisms, it seems reasonable to combine at least two different wear settings to assess the wear resistance of a new material.",

        "document": "Title: Epidemiology of travelers' diarrhea: details of a global survey\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic data on travelers' diarrhea (TD) are essential for the evaluation of conventional and future prophylactic and therapeutic measures. METHODS: To determine the epidemiology, including risk factors, impact and quality-of-life evaluation of TD, a cross-sectional survey was conducted over 12 months at the airports of Mombasa (Kenya), Goa (India), Montego Bay (Jamaica) and Fortaleza (Brazil) by distributing questionnaires to visitors just prior to their flying home. The study period was March 1996 to July 1998. RESULTS: Overall, 73,630 short-term visitors completed a questionnaire. The total diarrhea attack rate varied between a high of 54.6% in Mombasa and a low of 13.6% in Fortaleza, but only between 31.5% and 5.4% of all travelers had classic TD. The 14-day incidence rates varied between 19.5% and 65.7%. Few travelers meticulously avoided potentially dangerous food items, although in India and Kenya most travelers avoided those considered most dangerous. Risk factors were stays exceeding 1 week, age between 15 and 30 years, and residence in the UK. The impact, measured as incapacity or quality-of-life scores, was very considerable. CONCLUSIONS: TD continues to affect vacationers and business travelers as frequently as it did some 20 years ago. Compliance with recommendations to reduce exposure to pathogens by avoiding dangerous food items is poor among travelers from all countries. Implementation of food safety education programs may be difficult to achieve.",

From 1980 to 1994, 987 astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors were diagnosed, of which 122 (12.4%) were low-grade (WHO grade II). The incidence rates adjusted to the World Standard Population, per million population per year, were 2.28 for low-grade diffuse astrocytomas, 0.89 for oligoastrocytomas, and 2.45 for oligodendrogliomas. The survival rate (mean follow-up 7.5+/-4.8 years) was highest for patients with oligodendroglioma (78% at 5 years, 51% at 10 years), followed by those with oligoastrocytoma (70% at 5 years, 49% at 10 years) and fibrillary astrocytoma (65% at 5 years, 31% at 10 years). Survival of patients with gemistocytic astrocytoma was poor, with survival rates of 16% at 5 years and 0% at 10 years. Younger patients (<50 years) survived significantly longer than older patients (>50 years; P=0.013). DNA sequencing, performed in 84% of cases, revealed that TP53 mutations were most frequent in gemistocytic astrocytomas (88%), followed by fibrillary astrocytomas (53%) and oligoastrocytomas (44%), but were infrequent (13%) in oligodendrogliomas. The presence of TP53 mutations was associated with shorter survival of patients with low-grade diffuse gliomas (log-rank test; P=0.047), but when each histological type was analyzed separately, an association was observed only for oligoastrocytoma ( P=0.05). Loss on 1p and 19q were assessed by quantitative microsatellite analysis in 67% of cases. These alterations were frequent in oligodendrogliomas (1p, 57%; 19q, 69%), less common in oligoastrocytomas (1p, 27%; 19q, 45%), rare in fibrillary astrocytomas (1p, 7%; 19q, 7%), and absent in gemistocytic astrocytomas. None of these alterations were predictive of survival. These results establish the frequency of key genetic alterations in low-grade diffuse gliomas at a population-based level. Multivariate Cox's regression analysis indicates that only age and histological type, but not genetic alterations, are significant predictive factors.",

        "document": "Title: Does acute occlusion of the carotid T invariably have a poor outcome?\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognosis of patients with acute occlusion of the carotid T. METHODS: The authors studied 42 consecutive patients with acute carotid T occlusion, age 66 (59 to 74) years (median [interquartile range]). T occlusion was diagnosed with transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD; n = 11) and MR (n = 28) or CT (n = 3) angiography. Final infarction size was evaluated on follow-up CT 3 to 7 days after symptom onset and recanalization by follow-up TCD 24 to 36 hours after symptom onset. RESULTS: NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 18 (16 to 20). Final infarct size was one-third or less of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory in 11, greater than one-third but less than or equal to two-thirds of the MCA territory in 10, and greater than two-thirds of the MCA territory in 21 patients. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 6 months after stroke onset was 2 in 7 (17%), 3 in 2 (5%), 4 in 13 (31%), 5 in 7 (17%), and 6 in 13 (31%) patients. Complete or partial MCA recanalization within 24 hours after symptom onset was observed in 12 of 18 patients treated with thrombolysis and 4 of the remaining 24 patients (p = 0.001) and was associated with better clinical outcome (mRS 2, recanalization 6/7 [86%]; mRS 3 to 5, recanalization 8/22 [36%]; mRS 6, recanalization 2/13 [15%]; p = 0.01). Recanalization and NIHSS score on admission were independent predictors of outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Acute carotid T occlusion does not necessarily carry a poor prognosis. IV thrombolysis frequently results in recanalization, which is related to a better clinical outcome and smaller final infarction size.",

The most frequently used technique for swallow evaluation is X-ray videofluoroscopy. Most interventions are based on this examination. Only a few studies assessing interobserver reliability of videofluoroscopy have been published. The aim of our study was to assess the interobserver reliability of videofluoroscopy for swallow evaluation. Fifty-one consecutive dysphagic patients referred for videofluoroscopy were entered into the study regardless of their underlying disorder. The first swallow (5 ml of a semisolid radio-opague contrast media) of each patient was assessed in the lateral projection by 9 independent, experienced observers from different international swallow centers. All studies were evaluated according to a standardized protocol sheet and the interobserver reliability was calculated. The interobserver reliabilities assessed as kappa coefficient for parameters of the oral and pharyngeal phase, for the temporal occurrence of penetration/aspiration, and for the location of bolus residue ranged from 0.01 to 0.56. High reliability with an intraclass coefficient of 0.80 was achieved only with the well defined penetration/aspiration score. Our study underlines the need for exact definitions of the parameters assessed by videofluoroscopy, in order to raise interobserver reliability. To date, only aspiration is evaluated with high reliability by videofluoroscopy, whereas the reliability of all other parameters of oropharyngeal swallow is poor.",

        "document": "Title: Cholera: assessing the risk to travellers and identifying methods of protection\nAbstract: This review is based on the findings of a consultation meeting involving consultants in travel medicine and focusing on the risks of cholera to the traveller. Cholera is a severe diarrhoeal disease transmitted via the faeco-oral route and commonly associated with poor sanitation. Between the years of 1995 and 2001, the WHO reported 1829 cases of cholera in developed countries, the majority of which were imported. However, it is believed that this figure reflects less than 10% of the true incidence of cholera due to milder cases being unrecognised, as well as significant underreporting. Travellers to epidemic countries may be at increased risk of contracting cholera if they ingest contaminated food or water. It has been estimated that there are 0.2 cases of cholera per 100,000 European and North American travellers, though there is some evidence that this rate is higher. Oral vaccines are a necessary and welcome advance as, in addition to preventing illness, they can minimise the possibility of transmission of cholera to disease-free regions. The morbidity from cholera can range from asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infection to disruption of holiday and business plans, or even severe toxicity and dehydration. If untreated, severe illnesses can be fatal, although fatalities have not been reported among travellers for many years.",

QoL has become an increasingly important measure of outcome in child mental health clinical work and research. Here we provide a systematic review of QoL studies in children and young people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and address three main questions. (1) What is the impact of ADHD on QoL? (2) What are the relationships between ADHD symptoms, functional impairment and the mediators and moderators of QoL in ADHD? (3) Does the treatment of ADHD impact on QoL? Databases were systematically searched to identify research studies describing QoL in ADHD. Thirty six relevant articles were identified. Robust negative effects on QoL are reported by the parents of children with ADHD across a broad range of psycho-social, achievement and self evaluation domains. Children with ADHD rate their own QoL less negatively than their parents and do not always seeing themselves as functioning less well than healthy controls. ADHD has a comparable overall impact on QoL compared to other mental health conditions and severe physical disorders. Increased symptom level and impairment predicts poorer QoL. The presence of comorbid conditions or psychosocial stressors helps explain these effects. There is emerging evidence that QoL improves with effective treatment. In conclusion, ADHD seriously compromises QoL especially when seen from a parents' perspective. QoL outcomes should be included as a matter of course in future treatment studies.",

Methods: All subjects had iron deficiency anemia, i.e., a hemoglobin (Hb) level <10.0 g/dl and ferritin </=15 mug/l. Patients with an Hb level >/=9.0 g/dl and <10.0 g/dl received 200 mg iron sucrose intravenously twice weekly. If response to therapy was poor, patients additionally received 10,000 U rhEPO twice weekly. Patients with an Hb level <9.0 g/dl primarily received iron sucrose and rhEPO likewise. Results: Of the 84 patients, 59 had a baseline Hb level between 9.0 and 9.9 g/dl, of whom 32 responded poorly, thus receiving additional rhEPO. Twenty-five patients had a baseline Hb level <9.0 g/dl. The overall Hb level after therapy was 11.0 g/dl (+/-0.5, range 10.0-12.6 g/dl). Mean duration of therapy was 3.5 weeks (7 infusions). Conclusion: This study shows an effective treatment regimen for patients with various degrees of anemia in pregnancy. Iron sucrose is a safe and effective treatment option. In cases of severe iron deficiency anemia or poor response to parenteral iron therapy additional administration of rhEPO might be considered. However, the mechanism for not responding to intravenous iron therapy despite iron deficiency anemia still remains unclear to a large extent.",

METHODS We reviewed 70 robotic RP (RARP) and 20 open RP (ORP) medical centres. Their websites were reviewed for various factors, by two separate reviewers whose reviews were not seen by each other. Websites were graded based on accuracy and comprehensiveness of information by the senior investigator. RESULTS Of the academic and community-based RARP centres, 55% and 79% had specific websites (P < 0.05); 45% of RARP sites had generic information copied directly from the website of Intuitive Surgical (Sunnyvale, CA, USA; the manufacturer of the robotic system). ED was mentioned by only 54% of RARP sites and 45% of ORP sites; 17% of RARP sites were deemed accurate, compared with 30% of ORP sites (P < 0.05). Just over 1% of RARP sites were considered comprehensive, vs 10% of ORP sites (P < 0.05). A third of RARP sites had a direct link to the Intuitive Surgical website (16% academic vs 53% community, P < 0.05), compared to 10% of open sites (P < 0.05). Of most interest was that half of the RARP sites suggested that ED rates were lower for RARP than for ORP; this compared to ED rates being cited as lower for ORP on 5% of the ORP sites (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Despite the stature of RP as a treatment option for men with prostate cancer, and the recent increase in the use of RARP, the accuracy of information pertaining to sexual health on RP websites is poor, with many making false statements about the long-term outcomes for erectile function. This inadequacy appears to be greater on RARP than on ORP websites.",

This makes individual outcome prediction difficult and leads to increased within-group variation in clinical trials. The aim of this study on subjects with miSCI was (1) to rank the strongest single predictors and predictor combinations of later walking capacity, (2) to develop a reliable algorithm for clinical prediction, and (3) to identify subgroups with only limited recovery of walking function. Correlation and logistic regression analyses were performed on a dataset of 90 subjects, with tetra- or paraparesis, recruited in a prospective European multicenter study. Eleven measures obtained in the subacute injury period, including clinical examination, tibial somato-sensory evoked potentials (tSSEP) and demographic factors, were related to ambulatory outcome (WISCI II, 6minWT) 6 months after injury. The lower extremity motor score (LEMS) alone and in combination was identified as most predictive for later walking capacity in miSCI. Ambulatory outcome of subjects with tetraparesis was correctly predicted for 92% (WISCI II) or 100% (6minWT) of the cases when LEMS was combined with either tSSEP or the ASIA Impairment Scale, respectively. For individuals with paraparesis, prediction was less distinct mainly due to low prediction rates for individuals with poor walking outcome. A clinical algorithm was generated that allowed for the identification of a subgroup composed of individuals with tetraparesis and poor ambulatory recovery. These data provide evidence that a combination of predictors enables a reliable prediction of walking function and early patient stratification for clinical trials in miSCI.",

        "document": "Title: Organized inpatient (stroke unit) care in very old patients\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unclear whether very old patients benefit from organized inpatient (stroke unit) care. The aim of this work was to compare the clinical outcome of patients with first-ever ischemic stroke aged either >/=80 or <80 years who were treated conservatively (without cerebral revascularization) in a university-based stroke unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 147 (11%) patients >/=80 years and 1241 (89%) patients, <80 years. All patients underwent clinical examination, blood tests, electrocardiography (ECG), brain imaging and cerebrovascular ultrasound. Additional investigations were done at the discretion of the treating physician. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) score was used to assess the 3-month outcome (favorable: mRS, 0-1; poor: mRS, 2-6; death of any cause). RESULTS: Stroke severity did not differ between both groups [median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, 4]. Younger patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain, MR and catheter angiography and echocardiography (p<0.001) more frequently, whereas older patients underwent computed tomography of the brain and 24-hour ECG (p<0.001) more frequently. Stroke prevention included clopidogrel (p<0.001) and heparin (p=0.047) more often in older patients and aspirin (p=0.016) in younger patients. Recurrent ischemic events were similarly frequent in old (7%) and young (5%) patients. Favorable outcome was equally prevalent in old (71%) and young (76%) patients, whereas mortality was higher in older patients (7 and 3%, p=0.007). Admission NIHSS score >/=12 was the only independent predictor of unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 19.6; 95% confidence interval, 9.7-39.6; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our work provides further evidence that also the oldest patients may benefit from conservative stroke unit care.",

        "document": "Title: Risk factors associated with injury attributable to falling among elderly population with history of stroke\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke survivors are at high risk for falling. Identifying physical, clinical, and social factors that predispose stroke patients to falls may reduce further disability and life-threatening complications, and improve overall quality of life. METHODS: We used 5 biennial waves (1998-2006) from the Health and Retirement Study to assess risk factors associated with falling accidents and fall-related injuries among stroke survivors. We abstracted demographic data, living status, self-evaluated general health, and comorbid conditions. We analyzed the rate ratio (RR) of falling and the OR of injury within 2 follow-up years using a multivariate random effects model. RESULTS: We identified 1174 stroke survivors (mean age+/-SD, 74.4+/-7.2 years; 53% female). The 2-year risks of falling, subsequent injury, and broken hip attributable to fall were 46%, 15%, and 2.1% among the subjects, respectively. Factors associated with an increased frequency of falling were living with spouse as compared to living alone (RR, 1.4), poor general health (RR, 1.1), time from first stroke (RR, 1.2), psychiatric problems (RR, 1.7), urinary incontinence (RR, 1.4), pain (RR, 1.4), motor impairment (RR, 1.2), and past frequency of > or = 3 falls (RR, 1.3). Risk factors associated with fall-related injury were female gender (OR, 1.5), poor general health (OR, 1.2), past injury from fall (OR, 3.2), past frequency of > or = 3 falls (OR, 3.1), psychiatric problems (OR, 1.4), urinary incontinence (OR, 1.4), impaired hearing (OR, 1.6), pain (OR, 1.8), motor impairment (OR, 1.3), and presence of multiple strokes (OR, 3.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the high prevalence of falls and fall-related injuries in stroke survivors, and identifies factors that increase the risk. Modifying these factors may prevent falls, which could lead to improved quality of life and less caregiver burden and cost in this population.",

        "document": "Title: Psychological processing of transplantation in lung recipients: a quantitative study of organ integration and the relationship to the donor\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: Lung recipients undergo a complex psychological process, including organ integration and processing of attitudes towards the organ donor. DESIGN: Seventy-six lung recipients were asked to participate in a cross-sectional questionnaire study on the psychological processing of lung transplants. METHODS: The questionnaire consisted of statements describing aspects of organ integration and the patient's relationship with the donor. Furthermore, chronic stress/psychological distress (Screening Scale of the Trier Inventory; Symptom Checklist SCL-K-9) and the emotional effects of transplantation/immunosuppression (Transplant Effects Questionnaire; Medication Experience Scale for Immunosuppressants) were assessed. RESULTS: In general, lung recipients perceive the transplant as part of themselves (97.4%) and not as a foreign object (90%). One-third of patients still have frequent thoughts about the donor, whilst the majority (80.3%) do not believe that they have adopted the donor's characteristic traits. Factor analysis reveals the two-dimensional structure of the questionnaire items 'organ integration' (factor 1) and 'relationship to the donor' (factor 2). Poor organ integration predicts low adherence, low disclosure and high feelings of guilt, whilst a close donor relationship predicts chronic stress and psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Poor organ integration and a close relationship to the donor should be borne in mind in psychosocial treatment regarding the patient's adherence behaviour and psychological distress.",

The aim of our study was to extend the ophthalmic knowledge in JS and to add new findings.MethodsIn a retrospective study, 10 consecutive patients, who met the revised diagnostic criteria of JS were included. Mutation analysis was carried out in all the cases. Each patient underwent a comprehensive neuro-ophthalmological examination.ResultsBilateral drusen of the optic disc were found in two patients.

In nine patients performance during smooth pursuit, saccades, and vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) cancellation was poor.ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, the association of optic disc drusen with JS has not yet been described. In support of the earlier findings, decreased smooth pursuit and VOR cancellation, as well as partial-to-complete oculomotor apraxia seem to be the key oculomotor features of JS. Genotype-phenotype correlations showed the predictive value of CEP290and AHI1mutations for retinal involvement.",

The aim of the present retrospective study was to determine if there was an association between radiopharmaceutical uptake pattern and radiographic appearance of the sacroiliac region in horses. Seventy-nine horses undergoing bone scintigraphy with Tc-99m-HDP and radiography of the pelvis because of lameness or poor performance were studied. Subjective and semiquantitative methods were used to characterize and compare radiopharmaceutical uptake between horses. Ventrodorsal radiographs of the region were obtained and were evaluated. Subjectively, 70 horses (88.6%) had an abnormal uptake pattern. In nine horses, the sacroiliac region was normal (11.4%). There was no association between subjective evaluation of the scintigraphic images and semiquantitative methods. There was a significant association between radiopharmaceutical uptake and conformation (T- or Y-like form) and shape (butterfly-, wing-, leaf-, or horn-like) of the sacrum. The radiopharmaceutical uptake of the tubera sacralia was significantly higher in males (left side P=0.002, right side P=0.003). In conclusion, the conformation of the sacrum may play an important role in the scintigraphic appearance and may be the cause of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake.",

The performance of (1) nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nESI-MS), (2) surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and (3) isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was compared for the determination of dissociation constants (K(D)). The model system studied for this purpose was the human carbonic anhydrase I (hCAI) with eight known and well characterized sulfonamide inhibitors (Krishnamurthy et al., Chem. Rev. 2008, 108: 946-1051). The binding affinities of the inhibitors chosen vary by more than four orders of magnitude e.g., the K(D) value determined for ethoxzolamide by nESI-MS was 5 +/- 1 nM and the K(D) value for sulfanilamide was 145.7 +/- 10.0 microM. The agreement of the determined K(D) values by the three methods investigated was excellent for ethoxzolamide and benzenesulfonamide (variation with experimental error), good for acetazolamide and 4-carboxybenzenesulfonamide (variation by approximately one order of magnitude), but poor for others e.g., sulpiride. The accuracies of the K(D) values are determined, and advantages and drawbacks of the individual methods are discussed. Moreover, we critically evaluate the three examined methods in terms of ease of the measurement, sample consumption, time requirement, and discuss their limitations.",

METHODS: The data used for the study were taken from wave 6 of the nationally representative Swiss Household Panel (SHP) collected in 2004. The analysis was restricted to 4'371 employees aged 20 to 64 years. Trivariate crosstabulations and multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses stratified by gender were performed in order to calculate gender-specific prevalence rates (%), beta coefficients (SZ) and crude as well as multiple adjusted odds ratios (OR) as measures of association. RESULTS: Every eighth person (12.5%) within the study population has a high or very high WLC score. Prevalence rates are clearly above average in men and women with higher education, in executive positions or managerial functions, in full-time jobs, with variable work schedules, regular overtime, long commuting time to work and job insecurity. Working overtime regularly, having variable work schedules and being in a management position are most strongly associated with WLC in men, whereas in women the level of employment is the strongest explanatory variable by far, followed by variable work schedules and high job status (managerial position). In both men and women, WLC is associated with several physical and mental health problems. Employees with high or very high WLC show a comparatively high relative risk of self-reported poor health, anxiety and depression, lack of energy and optimism, serious backache, headaches, sleep disorders and fatigue. While overall prevalence rate of (very) high WLC is higher in men than in women, associations between degrees of WLC and most health outcomes are stronger in women than in men. CONCLUSIONS: This important issue which up to now has been largely neglected in public health research needs to be addressed in future public health research and, if the findings are confirmed by subsequent (longitudinal) studies, to be considered in workplace health promotion and interventions in Switzerland as elsewhere.",

Ziel der Studie war, Kenntnisse \u00fcber die Themen zu erhalten, zu denen nierentransplantierte Jugendliche von Pflegefachleuten Unterst\u00fctzung erwarten und wie wichtig diese sind. Dazu wurden in einer deskriptiven Querschnittserhebung 27 Jugendliche im Alter von zw\u00f6lf bis 18 Jahren anhand eines in einer Fokusgruppe entwickelten Fragebogen interviewt. Die 43 vorgegebenen Themen wurden von den Jugendlichen mit einem Stimmenanteil von 20?% bis 100?% als \u00absehr wichtig\u00bb eingestuft. Es zeigte sich, dass die Informationen \u00fcber die Krankheit und Behandlung am wichtigsten sind, gefolgt von der Unterst\u00fctzung durch das technisch-organisatorische Behandlungs- und Betreuungsangebot sowie den Informationen und der Unterst\u00fctzung zur pers\u00f6nlichen Lebensweise und -gestaltung.

Results showed that responses corresponding to the judgment \u201cvery important\u201d ranged from 20?% to 100?%. Information about illness and therapy was given highest priority, followed by the provision of support services as well as information and the support of planning and managing the personal way of living. These topics can be seen as a set of relevant variables that may be used for focused assessment, and for planning of nursing interventions. With regard to clinical practice it is necessary to develop nursing strategies and patient and family education programs based on the results of this study.",

        "document": "Title: Nutritional content of savanna plant foods: implications for browser/grazer models of ungulate diversification\nAbstract: Models of herbivore diversification rely heavily on adaptations that reflect the nutritional quality of foods consumed. In particular, browsers and grazers are expected to show dichotomous adaptations to deal with high quality (concentrate) browse-based and poor quality grass-based diets, respectively. In this study, we test the widespread assumption that browse represents a higher quality food source than grass. We analyzed plants from a South African savanna, collected over one dry and one wet season across several habitat types, for percent nitrogen (%N), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL) to compare variations in nutritional value of different food types. Results show consistently higher %N and lower NDF and ADF of tree foliage and forbs compared to monocots, but the former have consistently higher ADL, implying a higher fiber digestibility in grass compared with browse. Some fruit species have a high NDF and ADL content, implying poorer nutritional value than is commonly assumed. Our findings are in agreement with several other studies depicting relatively poor digestibility of browse (tree foliage and fruit) compared to grass. Reference to browse as high quality foods is therefore misleading, and models of herbivory that rest on this assumption require revision. The more efficient fiber digestibility recorded in grazers compared to browsers cannot be treated as an adaptation to poor quality diets, but rather to maximize benefits of higher fiber digestibility of grass. Spatio-seasonal variations in plant nutritional seem to reflect seasonal and spatial diet changes expected for grazers and intermediate (mixed) feeders. We propose that future studies require further detail on variations in diet, diet quality, and digestive efficiency to properly understand mechanisms of adaptation.",

We aimed to test the efficacy and tolerability of gemcitabine in treating MCL. Gemcitabine was given in doses of 1000 mg/m(2) as a 30 min infusion on days 1 and 8 of each 3 week cycle for a maximum of nine cycles. Eighteen patients with a median age of 70 years were recruited. MCL was newly diagnosed in half of patients and relapsed in the remainder. Fifteen patients had Ann Arbor stage IV. The best-recorded responses were 1 CR (complete remission), 4 PRs (partial responses), 8 SDs (stable diseases) and 4 PDs (diseases progression). The response rate (RR) (CR + PR) was 5 (28%; 95% confidence interval: 7.1, 48.5). The patient achieving a CR had stage IV disease. Most haematological adverse events occurred during the first chemotherapy cycle. Three patients developed non-haematological serious adverse events: dyspnea, glomerular microangiopathy with haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and hyperglycaemia. The median time-to-progression and treatment response duration (TRD) was 8.0 (95% confidence interval: 5.5, 9.3) and 10.6 (95% confidence interval: 5.5, 10.9) months, respectively. We conclude that Gemcitabine is well tolerated, moderately active and can induce disease stabilization in patients with MCL.",

The enormous economic losses suffered by private parties, businesses and public institutions in crisis events, the huge amounts of money which are spent in disaster prevention, as well as the challenges that providing emergency management and disaster control present, contain many issues and have an increasing social and economic relevance. This article takes a close look at the concept of disaster from an economic and management point of view to mitigate the impact on human beings and environment. Based on the rational choice approach the study analyzes the state of preparedness that is mainly responsible for good or poor disaster prevention and presents a theoretical framework for a comprehensive disaster management including examples of practical applications.

In the present work, the role of S100A2 protein expression in the prediction of regional metastasis-free survival (MFS) was investigated to guide neck management in LSCC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Specimens of LSCC from 62 consecutive untreated patients were examined for S100A2 content by immunocytochemistry; the patients were followed up for a median of 44 months (range 2-90 months) after initial surgical resection. MFS was calculated from the date of first surgery to that of regional neck node recurrence. RESULTS: S100A2 was detected in 18 of 19 (95%) low-grade tumours and in 22 of 43 (51%) high-grade tumours. The 5-year regional MFS was 81% for patients with S100A2-positive tumours and 55% for patients with S100A2-negative tumours. By multivariate analysis, the S100A2 status appeared to be a significant independent predictive factor for MFS (p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the assessment of S100A2 status at diagnosis may identify a subset of LSCC patients highly susceptible to neck node metastases and may thus help define therapy accordingly.",

METHODS:: First, factors associated with a switch to RAL were identified with a logistic regression including patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study with a history of 3 class failure (n = 423). Second, predictors for virologic outcome were identified in an intent-to-treat analysis including all patients who received RAL. Last observation carried forward imputation was used to determine week 24 response rate (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL). RESULTS:: The predominant factor associated with a switch to RAL in patients with suppressed baseline RNA was a regimen containing enfuvirtide [odds ratio 41.9 (95% confidence interval: 11.6-151.6)]. Efficacy analysis showed an overall response rate of 80.9% (152/188), whereas 71.8% (84/117) and 95.8% (68/71) showed viral suppression when stratified for detectable and undetectable RNA at baseline, respectively. Overall CD4 cell counts increased significantly by 42 cells/muL (P < 0.001). Characteristics of failures were a genotypic sensitivity score of the background regimen </=1, very low RAL plasma concentrations, poor adherence, and high viral load at baseline. CONCLUSIONS:: Virologic suppression rates in our routine clinical care setting were promising and comparable with data from previously published randomized-controlled trials.",

The effect of variable monitoring on the emergence of resistance after therapy with commonly used drug combinations was assessed by systematic review of studies reporting resistance in patients infected with HIV with a CD4 count of fewer than 200 cells per muL treated with two nucleoside analogues (including a thymidine analogue) and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. 8376 patients from eight cohorts and two prospective studies were analysed. Resistance at virological failure to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors at 48 weeks was 88.3% (95% CI 82.2-92.9) in infrequently monitored patients, compared with 61.0% (48.9-72.2) in frequently monitored patients (p<0.001). Lamivudine resistance was 80.5% (72.9-86.8) and 40.3% (29.1-52.2) in infrequently and frequently monitored patients, respectively (p<0.001); the prevalence of at least one thymidine analogue mutation was 27.8% (21.2-35.2) and 12.1% (5.9-21.4), respectively (p<0.001). Genotypic resistance at 48 weeks to lamivudine, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (thymidine analogue mutations), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors appears substantially higher in less frequently monitored patients. This Review highlights the need for cheap point-of-care viral-load tests to identify early viral failures and limit the emergence of resistance.",

As the proportions of people and activities in urban areas increase, metropolitan inequalities\r\nbecome a new challenge for the democratic Welfare State.\r\nApplying the protocol of the third phase of the International Metropolitan Observatory (IMO) we will\r\ndevelop our argument in three sections.

METHODS:: Data on self-reported missed doses of cART was collected every 6 months in Swiss HIV Cohort Study participants. We identified behavioral groups associated with specific cART adherence patterns using trajectory analyses. Repeated measures logistic regression identified predictors of changes in adherence between consecutive visits. RESULTS:: Six thousand seven hundred nine individuals completed 49,071 adherence questionnaires [median 8 (interquartile range: 5-10)] during a median follow-up time of 4.5 years (interquartile range: 2.4-5.1). Individuals were clustered into 4 adherence groups: good (51.8%), worsening (17.4%), improving (17.6%), and poor adherence (13.2%). Independent predictors of worsening adherence were younger age, basic education, loss of a roommate, starting intravenous drug use, increasing alcohol intake, depression, longer time with HIV, onset of lipodystrophy, and changing care provider. Independent predictors of improvements in adherence were regimen simplification, changing class of cART, less time on cART, and starting comedications. CONCLUSIONS:: Treatment, behavioral changes, and life events influence patterns of drug intake in HIV patients. Clinical care providers should routinely monitor factors related to worsening adherence and intervene early to reduce the risk of treatment failure and drug resistance.",

METHODS: The prospective observational study with 6-month follow up was performed in the cardio-thoracic and the medical ICU of a university hospital. AHF was defined according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Univariate Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients fulfilled the AHF criteria, of whom 86 and 24 underwent elective and emergency cardiac surgery, respectively. The remaining 82 medical patients had no surgical interventions. Cardiogenic shock was diagnosed in 32% of all patients and was the most common AHF presentation. Medical, elective surgery and emergency surgery AHF patients had a mortality at 30 days of 31%, 4.7% and 22% (<0.05) and at 180 days of 42%, 6.1% and 23% (<0.05), respectively. While the presence of cardiogenic shock was associated with a poor outcome (HR 1.8, CI 1.0-3.0; p=0.04), post-operative cardiac stunning had a good prognosis (HR 0.06, CI 0.01-0.47; p<0.01). Mortality worsened when infections (HR 2.8, CI 1.5-5.7; p<0.01) or renal dysfunction (HR 4.4, CI 2.2-8.4, p<0.01) were present on ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Medical patients, patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery and patients requiring emergency cardiac surgery are three distinct AHF-subpopulations.

The limited resources should be used in such a way that the additionally achievable health in the population is maximised. The increased health benefits (life expectance, quality of life) are the factor to is maximised. A purely efficency-orientated allocation of resources can, however, have a strong distribution effect that would be considered as unfair and unjust by many people and consequently not be accepted. In the meantime there is a body of empirical data evidence about the alternatives or additional criteria that are important for members of the population in the assesment of utility of medical interventions. Three of these possible criteria are discussed as examples here. Although the improvement in health is an important, perhaps even central criterion, a poor state of health, a limited health potential as well as other personal factors for the afflicted patient may, in part considerably, compensante for the achievable improvement in health. Systems for the evaluation of utility that will be accepted and supported by the general public must in future take into consideration the various explicit factors of the societal and individual benefits of health-care interventions and balance their relative importances.",

The current standard of quantification of hepatic steatosis is microscopic evaluation by pathologists, although consistency in such assessment remains unclear. Computerized image analysis is an alternative method for objective assessment of the degree of hepatic steatosis. METHODS: High resolution images of hematoxylin and eosin stained liver sections from 46 consecutive patients, initially diagnosed with liver steatosis, were blindly assessed by 4 established expert pathologists from different institutions. Computerized analysis was carried out simultaneously on the same sections. Interobserver agreement and correlation between the pathologists' and computerized assessment were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Spearman rank correlation coefficients, or descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Poor agreement among pathologists (ICC: 0.57) was found regarding the assessment of total steatosis, (ICC >0.7 indicates acceptable agreement). Pathologists' estimation of micro- and macrosteatosis disclosed also poor correlation (ICC: 0.22, 0.55, respectively). Inconsistent assessment of histological features of steatohepatitis (lobular inflammation, portal inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and Mallory hyaline) was documented. Poor conformity was also shown between the computerized quantification and ratings of 3 pathologists (Spearman rank correlation coefficients: 0.22, 0.82, 0.28, and 0.38). CONCLUSION: Quantification of hepatic steatosis in histological sections is strongly observer-dependent, not reproducible, and does not correlate with the computerized estimation. Current standards of assessment, previously published data and the clinical relevance of hepatic steatosis for liver surgery and transplantation must be challenged.",

        "document": "Title: Double allogeneic hematopoietic SCT as a rescue therapy for poor-risk hematological malignancies\nAbstract: The prognosis of patients with poor-risk or relapsed hematological malignancies is dismal. The dose intensification necessary to achieve subsequent CR is limited by the toxicity of chemotherapy. Treatment intensification with double allogeneic HSCT (dHSCT) may enhance the antileukemic effect and reduces treatment-related toxicity associated with prolonged aplasia during reinduction. We evaluated this approach in 23 patients, nine with primary refractory disease or relapse after conventional chemotherapy (group I) and 14 with relapses after allogeneic HSCT (group II). Double HSCT was feasible in all patients. At the end of the observation period, 6 of 23 (26%) patients were still alive and in remission with a median observation time of 60 months (1-153). The overall survival probability at 1 year was 41% (95% confidence interval (CI), 21-62%), transplant-related mortality (TRM) 28% (9-47%) and the incidence of relapse 42% (18-66%). The TRM in groups I and II were 22 and 36% and the relapse rate 33 and 50%, respectively. In conclusion, we have shown the feasibility of dHSCT with an acceptable TRM, irrespective of a previous allogeneic HSCT. Whether this approach offers a survival benefit for patients with poor-risk leukemias has to be tested in larger prospective trials.",

Sixty-three prospectively followed children with CH were assessed at age of 14 y with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and compared with 175 healthy controls. Median age at onset of treatment was 9 d (range 5-18 d) and median starting dose of levothyroxine (L-T4) was 14.7 microg/kg/d (range 9.9-23.6 microg/kg/d). Full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) was significantly lower than in controls after adjustment for socioeconomic status (SES) and gender (101.7 versus 111.4; p < 0.0001). Children with athyreosis had a lower performance IQ than those with dysgenesis (adjusted difference 7.6 IQ scores, p < 0.05). Lower initial thyroxine (T4) levels correlated with poorer IQ (r = 0.27, p = 0.04). Lower SES was associated with poorer IQ, in particular in children with CH (interaction, p = 0.03). Treatment during childhood was not related to IQ at age 14 y. Adolescents with CH manifest IQ deficits when compared with their peers despite early high-dose treatment and optimal substitution therapy throughout childhood. Those adolescents with athyreosis and lower SES are at particular risk for adverse outcome. Therefore, early detection of intellectual deficits is mandatory in children with CH.",

OBJECTIVE: To record current practice and results of CRT in paediatric and congenital heart disease. DESIGN: Retrospective multicentre European survey. SETTING: Paediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery centres. PATIENTS: One hundred and nine patients aged 0.24-73.8 (median 16.9) years with structural congenital heart disease (n = 87), congenital atrioventricular block (n = 12) and dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 10) with systemic left (n = 69), right (n = 36) or single (n = 4) ventricular dysfunction and ventricular dyssynchrony during sinus rhythm (n = 25) or associated with pacing (n = 84). INTERVENTIONS: CRT for a median period of 7.5 months (concurrent cardiac surgery in 16/109). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional improvement and echocardiographic change in systemic ventricular function. RESULTS: The z score of the systemic ventricular end-diastolic dimension decreased by median 1.1 (p<0.001). Ejection fraction (EF) or fractional area of change increased by a mean (SD) of 11.5 (14.3)% (p<0.001) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class improved by median 1.0 grade (p<0.001). Non-response to CRT (18.5%) was multivariably predicted by the presence of primary dilated cardiomyopathy (p = 0.002) and poor NYHA class (p = 0.003). Presence of a systemic left ventricle was the strongest multivariable predictor of improvement in EF/fractional area of change (p<0.001). Results were independent of the number of patients treated in each contributing centre. CONCLUSION: Heart failure associated with ventricular pacing is the largest indication for CRT in paediatric and congenital heart disease. CRT efficacy varies widely with the underlying anatomical and pathophysiological substrate.",

Sirolimus-eluting stents have been shown to perform better than paclitaxel eluting stents in long lesions. In this substudy of the LEADERS trial, we compared the performance of biolimus biodegradable polymer (BES) and sirolimus permanent polymer stents (SES) in long lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1,707 'all-comer' patients were randomly allocated to treatment with BES and SES. A stratified analysis of angiographic and clinical outcomes at nine months and one year, respectively was performed for vessels with lesion length <20 mm versus >20 mm (as measured by quantitative angiography).Of 1,707 patients, 592 BES patients with 831 lesions and 619 SES patients with 876 lesions had only short lesions treated. One hundred and fifty-three BES patients with 166 lesions and 151 SES patients with 162 lesions had long lesions. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics, except for higher number of patients with long lesions presenting with acute myocardial infarction in both stent groups. Long lesions tended to have lower MLD and greater percent diameter stenosis at baseline than short lesions. Late loss was greater for long lesions than short lesions. There was no statistically significant difference in late loss between BES and SES stents (0.32+/-0.69 vs 0.24+/-0.57, p=0.59). Binary in-segment restenosis was present in 23.2% versus 13.1% of long lesions treated with BES and SES, respectively (p=0.042). In patients with long lesions, the overall MACE rate was similar for BES and SES (17% vs 14.6%; p=0.62). There was a trend towards higher overall TLR rate with BES (12.4 % vs 6.0%; HR=2.06; p=0.07) and clinically driven TLR (10.5% vs 5.3%: HR 1.94; p=0.13). Rates of definite stent thrombosis were 3.3% in the long lesion group and 1.3-1.7 % in the short lesion group. CONCLUSIONS: BES and SES appear similar with respect to MACE in long lesions in this \"all-comer\" patient population. However, long lesions tended to have a higher rate of binary in-segment restenosis and TLR following BES than SES treatment.",

The systematic use of pulse oximetry to monitor and treat children in resource-poor developing countries, when coupled with a reliable oxygen supply, improves quality of care and reduces mortality. Oximetry also has a well established role in surgery and anaesthesia, but in many countries children undergo surgery without the safety of oximetry monitoring. This article reviews pulse oximetry, its technical basis and its application to the medical management of childhood illness to reduce mortality in developing countries. We propose that, as a part of the work towards achieving the Millennium Development Goal 4, there should be a concerted global effort to make pulse oximetry and a reliable oxygen source available in all health facilities where seriously ill children are managed.",

Several studies have demonstrated that persistent infections with Herpes viruses in general and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in particular have a profound influence on subset distribution, phenotype and potentially also on the function of T cells in ageing individuals. The association of CMV-seropositivity and accumulation of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells with decreased survival in longitudinal studies of very elderly has fostered the hypothesis that CMV-infection may be an important causative factor for the development of immune senescence. Here, we have critically summarized the current body of evidence supporting this hypothesis, highlight some controversial issues about its relevance and mechanisms and propose areas of future research to demonstrate unequivocally whether and how persistent infections might compromise the ageing immune system.",

METHODS: A modified Kessler's technique was used to repair 49 flexor tendon injuries in 39 children. All children had immediate postoperative mobilization according to the protocol that provides specific guidelines for preschoolers, children and teenagers. Range of motion was monitored and the final results were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: All children could be treated successfully according to the protocol with no occurrence of secondary tendon ruptures. Forty finger injuries were evaluated according to the Strickland classification, resulting in a median total active motion of 92.6 % with 29 (72.5 %) excellent results, 8 (20 %) good results, 3 (7.5 %) fair results and no poor result. All 7 thumbs had an excellent result according to the Buck-Gramcko score. There was no significant difference in outcomes between the three age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The rehabilitation protocol provided in this study allows an age-adapted early mobilization of children's hands after flexor tendon injuries. It respects age-specific limitations in rehabilitation and takes a child's superior healing capacity compared to adults into account. The good results and the very low complication rate observed in the present series suggest that the extra effort of early mobilization may be justified.",

Predictors of treatment outcomes after removal of amalgam fillings: associations between subjective symptoms, psychometric variables and mercury levels. Community Dent Oral Epidemiol 2010. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S Abstract - Objective: This analysis aimed to study predictors of different treatment outcomes and associations between subjective symptoms, psychometric variables and mercury levels in patients who subjectively attributed their health problems to dental amalgam. Material and methods: A secondary and retrospective analysis of data of a recently published randomized clinical trial was performed. Seventy-eight patients [44% female, mean (SD) age 35 (6) years, randomly assigned to either amalgam removal or a health promotion program] were included into statistical analysis. Prior to intervention and 12 months later, questionnaires for assessing symptoms, psychological distress and health status were presented, and mercury levels in blood and urine were determined. Results: The patients' personality profile at study onset was characterized by slightly reduced extraversion and slightly elevated emotional instability. Overall, subjective symptoms decreased slightly and there were no statistically significant differences in the decrease of symptoms after intervention between both groups. Decrease of mercury levels after intervention was closely associated with removal of amalgam fillings (r(mult) = 0.64 in regression analysis). Statistically significant correlations could be found between mercury levels and subjective symptoms with respect to baseline (r = 0.29-0.39) and to changes after intervention (r = 0.24-0.42), but not for psychological distress (r = 0.05-0.25) and health related quality of life (r = -0.03-0.18). Prediction of symptom improvement after intervention was poor (r(mult) = 0.44). Conclusions: Results contribute some new aspects to the inconsistent findings in the literature with respect to associations between symptoms and subtoxic mercury levels. More emphasis should be placed on exploring individual vulnerability for amalgam sensitivity.",

Cross-reactivity with steroid sulfates is one of the main causes for false positive results. Several approaches have been described to improve CAH screening: adjusting cut-off levels to gestational age or birth weight, and second-tier molecular genetic analysis or second-tier liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (TMS). METHODS: 17-OHP was extracted with diethyl ether from dried blood spots in order to separate 17-OHP from polar steroids (like steroid sulfates). The dried ether extracts of calibrators, controls, and patient samples were redissolved and measured with the 17-OHP test kit (Wallac). RESULTS: 760 normal, 1049 false positive, and 232 samples of confirmed cases with CAH were analysed. Mean 17-OHP values were significantly lower after extraction: Normal samples: 17.5 nmol/L vs. 3.2 nmol/L; false positive samples: 97.0 nmol/L vs. 25.9 nmol/L; CAH: 275 nmol/L vs. 205 nmol/L. With a cut-off value of 11.9 nmol/L (mean+3 SD of the normal values), 404 of the false positives turned out to be normal. Ether extraction revealed two distinct subgroups of initially false positives rather than a continuum with normal distribution of 17-OHP values. CONCLUSION: Diethyl ether extraction provided evidence for two causes of false positive results in CAH screening. It reduced the rate of false positives by about 40% without loss of sensitivity.",

        "document": "Title: Aerosol delivery of nebulised budesonide in young children with asthma\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Lung deposition of inhaled steroids, likely to be of benefit in the anti-inflammatory treatment of asthma in young children, is low. This is explained by age specific anatomical and physiological characteristics as well as poor cooperation with aerosol therapy. However, total lung deposition and the ratio of lung deposition to oropharyngeal deposition are key determinants of clinical efficacy and of systemic side effects of aerosolized drugs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine lung deposition and ratio of lung deposition to oropharyngeal deposition using a modified vibrating membrane nebuliser to deliver budesonide with a small particle size, taking into account the needs of young children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten asthmatic children (5 males), mean age 20.3 months (range 6-41 months) inhaled radiolabelled budesonide (MMD 2.6microm) through a modified vibrating membrane nebuliser (modified PARI e-Flow). Lung deposition expressed as a percentage of the emitted dose was measured using scintigraphy and the ratio of lung deposition to oropharyngeal deposition was calculated. RESULTS: Mean lung deposition (SD) expressed as percentage of emitted dose and mean lung to oropharyngeal deposition ratio (SD) in quietly breathing children (n=5) and in children crying during inhalation were 48.6% (10.5) versus 20.0% (10.9), and 1.0 (0.3) versus 0.3 (0.2), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that by using an improved age-adjusted complementary combination of delivery device and drug formulation to deliver small particles, lung deposition and ratio of lung deposition to oropharyngeal deposition in young asthmatic children is highly improved. But the main factor limiting aerosol delivery in this age group remains cooperation.",

A detailed neurologic examination of infants is a valuable predictive tool in terms of later moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairments; however, it may be limited in the immediate newborn period. Electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and clinical risk factors for adverse neurodevelopmental outcome have been identified. Good prediction is usually achieved for major functional disabilities in early childhood, but is poorer for moderate or mild long-term outcome. Future research should focus on the long-term quality of life, academic achievement, and the influence of the sociocultural environment. More emphasis should be placed on genetic diversity as a modifying factor for the large variability in outcome.",

        "document": "Title: Expansion of the prognostic assessment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the updated BODE index and the ADO index\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The BODE index (including body-mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea, and exercise capacity) was an important contribution to the prognostic assessment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, no study has assessed whether the risk of mortality predicted by the BODE index matches the observed mortality in different populations. We assessed the calibration of the BODE index, updated it to improve its calibration, and developed and validated a simplified index for use in primary-care settings. METHODS: We included 232 patients from the Swiss Barmelweid cohort with longstanding and severe COPD and 342 patients from the Spanish Phenotype and Course of COPD cohort study who had had their first hospital admission due to moderate-to-severe COPD. In both cohorts we compared the observed 3-year risk of all-cause mortality with the risk predicted by the BODE index. We then updated the BODE index and developed a simplified ADO index (including age, dyspnoea, and airflow obstruction) from the Swiss cohort, and validated both in the Spanish cohort. FINDINGS: Calibration of the BODE index was poor, with relative underprediction of 3-year risk of mortality by 36% in the Swiss cohort (median predicted risk 21.7% [IQR 12.7-31.7] vs 34.1% observed risk; p=0.013) and relative overprediction by 39% in the Spanish cohort (16.7% [12.7-31.7] vs 12.0%; p=0.035). The 3-year risk of mortality predicted by both the updated BODE (median 10.7% [8.1-13.8]) and ADO indices (11.8% [9.1-14.3]) matched the observed mortality in the Spanish cohort well (p=0.99 and p=0.98, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Both the updated BODE and ADO indices could lend support to the prognostic assessment of patients with COPD in specialised and primary-care settings. Such assessment enhances the targeting of treatments to individual patients.

        "document": "Title: The course of newly presented unexplained complaints in general practice patients: a prospective cohort study\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Newly presented unexplained complaints (UCs) are common in general practice. Factors influencing the transition of newly presented into persistent UCs have been scarcely investigated. We studied the number and the nature of diagnoses made over time, as well as factors associated with UCs becoming persistent. Finally, we longitudinally studied factors associated with quality of life (QoL). METHODS: Prospective cohort study in general practice of patients presenting with a new UC. Data sources were case record forms, patient questionnaires and electronic medical registries at inclusion, 1, 6 and 12 months. Presence of complaints and diagnoses made over time were documented. Potential risk factors were assessed in mixed-effect logistic and linear regression models. RESULTS: Sixty-three GPs included 444 patients (73% women; median age 42) with unexplained fatigue (70%), abdominal complaints (14%) and musculoskeletal complaints (16%). At 12 months, 43% of the patients suffered from their initial complaints. Fifty-seven percent of the UCs remained unexplained. UCs had (non-life-threatening) somatic origins in 18% of the patients. QoL was often poor at presentation and tended to remain poor. Being a male [odds ratio (OR) 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-0.8] and GPs' being more certain about the absence of serious disease (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-0.9) were the strongest predictors of a diminished probability that the complaints would still be present and unexplained after 12 months. The strongest determinants of complaint persistence [regardless of (un)explicability] were duration of complaints >4 weeks before presentation (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.6-4.3), musculoskeletal complaint at baseline (OR 2.3; 1.2-4.5), while the passage of time acted positively (OR 0.8 per month; 95% CI 0.78-0.84). Musculoskeletal complaints, compared to fatigue, decreased QoL on the physical domain (4.6 points; 2.6-6.7), while presence of psychosocial factors decreased mental QoL (5.0; 3.1-6.9). CONCLUSION: One year after initial presentation, a large proportion of newly presented UCs remained unexplained and unresolved. We identified determinants that GPs might want to consider in the early detection of patients at risk of UC persistence and/or low QoL.",

METHODS: All subjects had iron deficiency anemia, i.e., a hemoglobin (Hb) level <10.0 g/dl and ferritin < or =15 microg/l. Patients with an Hb level > or =9.0 g/dl and <10.0 g/dl received 200 mg iron sucrose intravenously twice weekly. If response to therapy was poor, patients additionally received 10,000 U rhEPO twice weekly. Patients with an Hb level <9.0 g/dl primarily received iron sucrose and rhEPO likewise. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients, 59 had a baseline Hb level between 9.0 and 9.9 g/dl, of whom 32 responded poorly, thus receiving additional rhEPO. Twenty-five patients had a baseline Hb level <9.0 g/dl. The overall Hb level after therapy was 11.0 g/dl (+/-0.5, range 10.0-12.6 g/dl). Mean duration of therapy was 3.5 weeks (7 infusions). CONCLUSION: This study shows an effective treatment regimen for patients with various degrees of anemia in pregnancy. Iron sucrose is a safe and effective treatment option. In cases of severe iron deficiency anemia or poor response to parenteral iron therapy additional administration of rhEPO might be considered. However, the mechanism for not responding to intravenous iron therapy despite iron deficiency anemia still remains unclear to a large extent.",

ERP markers of temporal processing (Cue CNV) and inhibition (NoGo P300) were obtained in matched groups of children (32 with ADHD, mean age 11.2 years, and 31 controls, mean age 11.1 years) and adults (22 ADHD, mean age 42.7 years, and 22 controls, mean age 44.0 years). ERP markers and performance reflected both age and ADHD status. Performance was poorer, and Cue CNV and NoGo P300 were weaker in ADHD children and adults compared to their matched controls. ADHD-related ERP differences in children were more prominent at posterior scalp sites but more pronounced at anterior scalp sites in adults, paralleling the prominent topographic changes of both ERP markers with development. The fact that differences in the same test and the same processing period appear in both children and adults, but that they present in different aspects of performance and different scalp topographies, leads to the conclusion that some ADHD-related deficits persist into adulthood despite alterations of their qualitative aspects.",

        "document": "Title: Altruism, education and inequality in the United States\nAbstract: This thesis contains several lines of research conducted during my four years at the European University Institute. It consists of three chapters that analyze the link between parental inter-vivos transfers, education and inequality. In the first chapter, \"Accounting for the Changing Role of Family Income in Determining College Entry\", I present a computable dynamic general equilibrium model with overlapping generations and incomplete markets and I use this model to measure the fraction of households constrained in their college entry decision. College education is financed by family transfers and public subsidies, where transfers are generated through altruism on part of the parents. Parents face a trade-off between making transfers to their children and own savings. Ceteris paribus, parents who expect lower future earnings transfer less and save more. Data from the 1986 Survey of Consumer Finances give support to this mechanism. I show that this trade-off leads to substantially higher estimates of the fraction of constrained households compared to the results in the empirical literature (18 instead of 8 percent). The model also predicts that an increment in parents' earnings uncertainty decreases their willingness to provide transfers. In combination with rising returns to education, which makes college going more attractive, this boosts the number of constrained youths and explains why family income has become more important for college access over the last decades in the U.S. economy. In chapter two, titled \"Why Do the Rich Save More: The Role of Housing\", I analyze the determinants of the wealth-income gradient with educational attainment that is observable in the data. This gradient is very steep: using the 1989 wave of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), I find the median college graduate near retirement age holds twice as much wealth as the median high school dropout. In this paper, I argue that housing plays an important role for explaining the wealth-income gradient that is observable in the data. The last chapter, \"Parental Transfers and Parental Income: Does the Future Matter More Than the Present?\" adds to the results that were derived in the first chapter. More precisely, I present a model of parental transfers that is based on the assumption of one sided altruism. I use this model to analytically study the link between parental expectations about their future resources and their present transfer behavior. In the context of my model, I show that parents with brighter earnings prospects are willing to transfer more to their o spring already today, all other things equal.",

METHODS: All patients with ALL treated at the only cancer pediatric hospital in Nicaragua during 2006 were studied prospectively. Diagnostic immunophenotyping was performed locally and bone marrow or blood samples were sent to the cytogenetic laboratory of Zurich for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and G-banding. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients with ALL were evaluated. Their mean age at diagnosis was 7.3 years, 31.8% were >or=10 years. Thirty-four patients (51.5%) presented with hyperleucocytosis >or=50 x 10(9)/L, 45 (68.2%) had hepatosplenomegaly. Immunophenotypically 63/66 patients (95%) had a B-precursor, 2 (3%) a T- and 1 (1.5%) a B-mature ALL. FISH analysis demonstrated a TEL/AML1 fusion in 9/66 (14%), BCR/ABL fusion in 1 (1.5%), MLL rearrangement in 2 (3.1%), iAMP21 in 2 (3.1%), MYC rearrangement in 1 (1.5%), and high-hyperdiploidy in 16 (24%). All patients but two with TEL/AML1 fusion and high-hyperdiploidy were clinically and hematologically in the standard risk group whereas those with poor cytogenetic factors had clinical high-risk features and were treated intensively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to Europe, the ALL population in Nicaragua is older, has a higher proportion of poor prognostic clinical and hematological features and receives more intensive treatment, while patients with TEL/AML1 translocations and high-hyperdiploidy are clinically in the standard risk group. Cytogenetics did not contribute as an additional prognostic factor in this setting.",

In 107 infants undergoing open-heart surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD), we evaluated weight at birth, at surgery, and at one year of age (expressed as z-scores). Neurodevelopmental status was assessed before surgery and at one year of age. Median age at surgery was 3.9 months (range: 0.1-10.2). Mean [+/-standard deviation (S.D.)] weight z-score at birth was -0.27 (+/-1.45), before surgery -1.34 (+/-1.45) (p<0.001 vs. birth weight), and at one year -0.86 (+/-1.35), (p<0.001 vs. weight at surgery). Poor preoperative weight (<10th percentile) was associated with genetic disorders [odds ratio (OR) 5.9, p<0.001], preoperative neurological abnormalities (OR 3.41, p<0.05), and older age at surgery (OR 1.01, p<0.05). Weight <10th percentile at one year was associated with the same factors as poor preoperative weight, however, also with risk adjustment for congenital heart surgery-1 (RACHS) score >3 (OR 3.22, p<0.05). Neurodevelopmental outcome at one year was not determined by growth failure. In conclusion, impaired body weight gain before surgery is followed by a catch-up growth after surgery. However, there is no relationship to neurodevelopmental outcome. Genetic comorbidity is the most significant factor for poor weight gain.

        "document": "Title: Anthocyanins and anthocyanidins are poor inhibitors of CYP2D6\nAbstract: The cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 isoform is involved in the metabolism of about 50% of all psychoactive drugs, including neuroleptic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. Therefore, inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity by foodstuffs has implications for drug safety. The present study addresses inhibitory effects of polyphenolic anthocyanins and their aglycons that are found in many dietary fruits and vegetables. Using a chemiluminescent assay, we obtained IC(50) values ranging from 55 microM to > 800 microM for 17 individual compounds. According to earlier data on furanocoumarins from grapefruit extract, CYP2D6 inhibition is achieved in the range of 190-900 nM. As the tested anthocyanins and anthocyanidins were shown to be about 1,000-fold less potent, they are unlikely to interfere with drug metabolism by CYP2D6. Further studies are warranted to examine the effects of the above flavonoids on other CYP isoforms for more detailed toxicity profiles.",

In this article, drawing on research conducted in the Yerer and Daketa Valleys, eastern Ethiopia, we use the notion of entitlements to examine how, under increasing pressure for resource access, various agro-pastoral households manage conflicting interests in common grazing resources. We observed that in times of drought and resource scarcity incumbent agro-pastoralists find peaceful sharing arrangements with intruding pastoralists. Asset-poor agro-pastoralists enter into mutually beneficial arrangements with pastoralists, trading their resource endowments to grazing land for other assets from the pastoralists, whereas wealthier households prefer a reciprocal risk- management strategy. These multiple arrangements have distributional effects because asset-poor agro-pastoralist households can stabilize or enhance their household assets and their capabilities in times of drought, and thus benefit from assisting pastoralist migrants to the common grazing land.",

Method A complete census of all 3155 patients ever admitted was analysed using the proportional hazard model (including time dependent covariates). Results Median length of stay was 11.4 years; the maximal length of stay was 13.9 years. 299 positive and 463 negative terminations were registered. Terminations clustered in the first year. Both time to positive and negative termination was significantly dependent on historical treatment cohorts since 1994. Positive termination was negatively associated with treatment in larger treatment centres (OR: 0.77, CI: 0.61-0.97) and positively with income from the social system (OR: 1.33; CI: 1.03-1.72). Negative terminations were positively associated with HIV infection before treatment (OR: 1.74; CI: 1.40-2.16), delinquence (OR 1.36; CI: 1.09-1.69), and higher levels of distrust (OR: 1.18 per scoring point; CI = 1.05-1.31). Conclusions Length of stay in Swiss HAT is considerable. The proportion of positive terminations did not increase with longer stays, indicating that the majority of patients are in chronic palliative care. Negative terminations outweighed positive terminations, with a low predictive power from co-variates. The routine assessment and analysis of different covariates, such as indicators of treatment process, has the potential to improve the therapeutic outcomes of HAT.",

        "document": "Title: Fear of being laughed at and social anxiety: A preliminary psychometric study\nAbstract: The present study examines the relationship between questionnaire measures of social phobia and gelotophobia. A sample of 211 Colombian adults filled in Spanish versions of the Social Anxiety and Distress scale (SAD; Watson & Friend, 1969), the Fear of Negative Evaluation scale (FNE; Watson & Friend, 1969) and the GELOPH<15> (Ruch & Proyer, 2008). Results confirmed that both Social Anxiety and Distress and Fear of Negative Evaluation scale overlapped with the fear of being laughed at without being identical with it. The SAD and FNE correlated highly with the GELOPH<15> but not all high scorers in these scales expressed a fear of being laughed at. Furthermore, an item factor analysis yielded three factors that were mostly loaded by items of the respective scales. This three-factor structure was verified using confirmatory factor analysis. A measure model where one general factor of social anxiety was specified, or another one where two different factors were defined (gelotophobia vs. social anxiety assessed by SAD and FNE) showed a very poor fit to the data. It is concluded that the fear of being laughed cannot fully be accounted for by these measures of social phobia.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Fifty consecutive patients (47 men, age 69.6 +/- 9.6 years, body mass index 26.6 +/- 3.5 kg/m) underwent clinically indicated 128-slice dual-source CT angiography of the entire thorax for the evaluation of graft patency after CABG surgery using a prospectively ECG-synchronized high-pitch spiral acquisition mode (pitch 3.2; 100 kV tube voltage, 0.28 seconds gantry rotation time). Heart rates (HR) were noted. Image quality of the proximal anastomosis, graft body, distal anastomosis, and postanastomotic coronary artery were graded by 2 independent readers on a 3-point scale (1 = excellent, 2 = moderate, and 3 = poor/nondiagnostic). Quantitative image quality parameters (noise, contrast-to-noise ratio) were measured. Effective radiation doses were calculated. RESULTS:: Mean HR was 76 +/- 19 bpm (range, 45-135 bpm). Median scan time was 0.9 seconds (range, 0.76-1.17 seconds), mean scan length was 349 +/- 38 mm (range, 294-452 mm). A total of 125 CABG (54% arterial grafts) and 465 vessel sections were analyzed. Twelve grafts were proximally occluded. Diagnostic image quality was obtained in 462 (99.4%) sections. Of those, image quality was excellent in 397 (85.4%) and moderate in 65 (14.0%). All 3 (0.6%) nondiagnostic sections affected the distal anastomosis due to motion artifacts caused by high HR. Separating the study population by the median HR of 71 bpm, image quality of the distal anastomosis regarding motion artifacts was significantly lower at high HR (P < 0.05). Interobserver agreement in grading image quality of graft segments was good (kappa = 0.77). Image noise in the aorta was 36.9 +/- 8.1, contrast-to-noise ratio was 13.1 +/- 4.2. Effective radiation dose was 2.3 +/- 0.3 mSv. CONCLUSIONS:: The patency of coronary artery bypass grafts can be assessed with decreasing image quality at high HR in high-pitch prospectively ECG-synchronized thoracic 128-slice dual-source CT angiography at a low radiation dose.",

The study aimed to evaluate prognostic factors for outcome in relapsed patients. Age, gender, initial stage, metastatic disease, local stage, histology, time to relapse and tumour volume were analysed for their prognostic relevance. Overall survival after relapse was 48% (median follow-up 5 years). Relapses were local in 28%, metastatic in 57% and combined in 15%. The median age of the cohort was 4.5 years whereas patients in complete continuous remission were significantly younger (3.1 years, p=0.001). Patients with initial stage I and II showed a significantly better prognosis than children with stage III (57 vs. 31%, p=0.008). Patients with high-risk tumours had a much poorer prognosis than those with intermediate and low-risk tumours (58 vs. 31%, p=0.003). Children with recurrence within 6 months after diagnosis had a poorer outcome than children relapsing later on (54 vs. 22%, p=0.0001). The tumour volume initially and after preoperative chemotherapy did not have any influence on outcome. Patients with isolated distant metastasis had a significantly better outcome than those with local and combined relapses (p=0.001). In conclusion, factors for poor prognosis after relapse are early relapse, local stage III, high-risk histology and combined relapse.",

These aims were pursued through a stratification strategy using white blood cell count, age, immunophenotype, treatment response, and unfavorable genetic aberrations providing an excellent discrimination of risk groups. Estimated 6-year event-free survival (6y-pEFS) for all 2169 patients was 79.6% (+/- 0.9%). The large standard-risk (SR) group (35% of patients) achieved an excellent 6y-EFS of 89.5% (+/- 1.1%) despite significant reduction of anthracyclines. In the medium-risk (MR) group (53% of patients), 6y-pEFS was 79.7% (+/- 1.2%); no improvement was accomplished by the randomized use of additional intermediate-dose cytarabine after consolidation. Omission of preventive cranial irradiation in non-T-ALL MR patients was possible without significant reduction of EFS, although the incidence of central nervous system relapses increased. In the high-risk (HR) group (12% of patients), intensification of consolidation/reinduction treatment led to considerable improvement over the previous ALL-BFM trials yielding a 6y-pEFS of 49.2% (+/- 3.2%). Compared without previous trial ALL-BFM 90, consistently favorable results in non-HR patients were achieved with significant treatment reduction in the majority of these patients.",

Two subject groups of children (aged 6-8 and 9-12 years) and adult controls performed several motor tasks from the Z\u00fcrich Neuromotor Assessment (ZNA) test, as well as a unilateral and bilateral obstacle stepping test during treadmill walking. Performance of ZNA items, changes in foot clearance, and obstacle hits were assessed. Correlations between children's age, ZNA and obstacle measures were calculated. Performance of all motor tasks improved with increasing age. All three groups improved foot clearance during unilateral obstacle stepping, while the younger children achieved a poorer performance level. During bilateral obstacle stepping, only the adult controls and the 9-12 years old children's group further improved foot clearance, while no further improvement occurred in the 6-8 years old children's group. A relationship between items of ZNA and bilateral obstacle stepping was found. It is concluded that children in the mid-childhood range are able to significantly improve performance of a high-precision locomotor task. However, children below 9 years of age have a poorer motor performance compared to older children and adults that becomes more pronounced with increasing complexity of the task. Finally, ZNA tests can improve the prediction of complex adaptive locomotor behaviour compared to calendar age alone.",

RECENT FINDINGS: Antiangiogenic therapy has recently reached the clinic with the approval of bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastomas. A number of promising antiangiogenic and vasculature-modifying agents are under investigation for newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant gliomas. A recurrence under ongoing or after antiangiogenic therapy is often characterized by a more aggressive and, in particular, invasive phenotype. SUMMARY: Despite impressively high radiological response rates in patients with recurrent malignant glioma, the duration of response is usually short-lived, and the observed effect to a large extent may be due to normalization of the disrupted blood-brain barrier and less due to a direct antitumor effect. Overall survival remains poor. Induction of invasive phenotypes and escape with proangiogenic alternative pathways are contributing to resistance. Investigation of combination regimes targeting several pathways will determine the possibilities to overcome the resistance to antiangiogenic therapy in malignant gliomas. This article summarizes the results of recent clinical trials in this field, points towards mechanisms of resistance arising under angiogenesis inhibition and discusses the challenges for the future.",

        "document": "Title: Climate or development: is ODA diverted from its original purpose?\nAbstract: We analyze the interaction of climate and development policy that has taken place since the early 1990s. Increasing dissatisfaction about the results of traditional development cooperation and the appeal of climate policy as a new policy field led to a rapid reorientation of aid flows. At the turn of the century, over 7% of aid flows were spent on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. However, the contribution of emissions mitigation projects to the central development objective of poverty reduction as specified in the Millennium Development Goals is limited and other project types are likely to be much more effective. Adaptation to climate change can be expected to have higher synergies with poverty alleviation than mitigation, primarily through its impact on health, the conservation of arable land and the protection against natural disasters. An analysis of the Clean Development Mechanism shows that projects addressing the poor directly are very rare; even small renewable energy projects in rural areas tend to benefit rich farmers and the urban population. Use of development aid for CDM projects and / or their preparation via capacity building is thus clearly not warranted. We further analyze whether the use of development aid for climate policy could be justified as a countermeasure against the emission increase related to successful development itself. However, countries that are achieving an improvement of human development from a low level are unlikely to increase their energy consumption substantially. Only at a level where the middle class expands rapidly, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions soar. Thus targeting middle class energy consumption by appliance efficiency standards and public transport-friendly urban planning are the most effective measures to address developing country emissions. Rural renewable energy provision in poor countries has a much higher impact on poverty, but a much lower impact on greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that while there are valid reasons for long-term collaboration with emerging economies on greenhouse gas mitigation, there should be a separate budget line for such activities to avoid \u201cobfuscation\u201d of a decline of resources aimed at poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, mitigation will remain attractive for donors because it ensures quick disbursements and relatively simple measures of success. Moreover, mitigation activities in developing countries provide politicians in industrialized countries with a welcome strategy to divert the attention of their constituencies from the lack of success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions domestically.",

METHODS: We investigated predictors of toxicity-related treatment modification during the first year of CART in 1318 antiretroviral-naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study who began treatment between January 1, 2005, and June 30, 2008. RESULTS: The total rate of treatment modification was 41.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.6-45.8) per 100 person-years. Of these, switches or discontinuations because of drug toxicity occurred at a rate of 22.4 (95% CI, 19.5-25.6) per 100 person-years. The most frequent toxic effects were gastrointestinal tract intolerance (28.9%), hypersensitivity (18.3%), central nervous system adverse events (17.3%), and hepatic events (11.5%). In the multivariate analysis, combined zidovudine and lamivudine (hazard ratio [HR], 2.71 [95% CI, 1.95-3.83]; P < .001), nevirapine (1.95 [1.01-3.81]; P = .050), comedication for an opportunistic infection (2.24 [1.19-4.21]; P = .01), advanced age (1.21 [1.03-1.40] per 10-year increase; P = .02), female sex (1.68 [1.14-2.48]; P = .009), nonwhite ethnicity (1.71 [1.18-2.47]; P = .005), higher baseline CD4 cell count (1.19 [1.10-1.28] per 100/microL increase; P < .001), and HIV-RNA of more than 5.0 log(10) copies/mL (1.47 [1.10-1.97]; P = .009) were associated with higher rates of treatment modification. Almost 90% of individuals with treatment-limiting toxic effects were switched to a new regimen, and 85% achieved virologic suppression to less than 50 copies/mL at 12 months compared with 87% of those continuing CART (P = .56). CONCLUSIONS: Drug toxicity remains a frequent reason for treatment modification; however, it does not affect treatment success. Close monitoring and management of adverse effects and drug-drug interactions are crucial for the durability of CART.",

DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional, quasi-experimentally controlled study. Study participants underwent an acute standardized psychosocial stress task combining public speaking and mental arithmetic in front of an audience. \r\nSETTING: The study was conducted in the population in the state of Zurich, Switzerland. SUBJECTS: Subjects included 22 hypertensive and 26 normotensive men (mean +/- sem 44 +/- 2 yr). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed the psychological measures social support, emotional regulation, and cognitive appraisal of the stressful situation. Moreover, we measured salivary cortisol and plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine before and after stress and several times up to 60 min thereafter as well as blood pressure and heart rate. \r\nRESULTS: We found poorer hedonistic emotional regulation (HER) and lower perceived social support in hypertensives, compared with normotensives (P < 0.01). Compared with normotensives, hypertensives showed higher cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine secretions after stress (P < 0.038) as well as higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.001). Cortisol reactivity and norepinephrine secretion were highest in hypertensive men with low HER (P < 0.05). In contrast, hypertensives with high HER did not significantly differ from normotensives in both cortisol and norepinephrine secretion after stress. Epinephrine secretion was highest in hypertensives with low social support but was not different between hypertensives with high social support and normotensives. \r\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that both low social support and low HER are associated with elevated stress hormone reactivity in systemic hypertension.",

Cardiogenic edema pathogenically is caused by elevated hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries due to left sided congestive heart failure. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is categorized depending on the underlying pathogenesis in low-alveolar pressure, elevated permeability or neurogenic edema. Some important examples of causes are upper airway obstruction like in laryngeal paralysis or strangulation for low alveolar pressure, leptospirosis and ARDS for elevated permeability, and epilepsy, brain trauma and electrocution for neurogenic edema. The differentiation between cardiogenic versus non-cardiogenic genesis is not always straightforward, but most relevant, because treatment markedly differs between the two. Of further importance is the identification of the specific underlying cause in non-cardiogenic edema, not only for therapeutic but particularly for prognostic reasons. Depending on the cause the prognosis ranges from very poor to good chance of complete recovery.",

        "document": "Title: Two case examples of pelvic fractures in medieval populations from central Europe\nAbstract: Pelvic fractures are considered to be uncommon and difficult to treat, even in the modern medical literature. Serious and eventually life-threatening associated injuries may occur, requiring emergency abdominal, vascular or neurologic surgery. Pelvic fractures can also be managed non-operatively; however, a considerable dispute exists on the suitable management strategy. The treatment and healing of such injuries in the bioarchaeological record, is therefore of great interest for anthropological and medico-historical studies. Fractures of the pelvis are rarely reported in the anthropological literature either due to poor preservation of the innominate bone or lack of adequate examination. Here we present two cases of pelvic fractures observed on two adult male individuals from two European medieval sites. They differ in severity and in the pattern of healing. They are both adequately healed and probably had no acute life-threatening consequences, which gives us some insight into the medical knowledge and means of management of past populations.",

        "document": "Title: Self-perceived stress reactivity is an indicator of psychosocial impairment at the workplace\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Work related stress is associated with a range of debilitating health outcomes. However, no unanimously accepted assessment tool exists for the early identification of individuals suffering from chronic job stress. The psychological concept of self-perceived stress reactivity refers to the individual disposition of a person to answer stressors with immediate as well as long lasting stress reactions, and it could be a valid indicator of current as well as prospective adverse health outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which perceived stress reactivity correlates with various parameters of psychosocial health, cardiovascular risk factors, and parameters of chronic stress and job stress in a sample of middle-aged industrial employees in a so-called \"sandwich-position\". METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 174 industrial employees were assessed for psychosocial and biological stress parameters. Differences between groups with high and low stress reactivity were analysed. Logistic regression models were applied to identify which parameters allow to predict perceived high versus low stress reactivity. RESULTS: In our sample various parameters of psychosocial stress like chronic stress and effort-reward imbalance were significantly increased in comparison to the normal population. Compared to employees with perceived low stress reactivity, those with perceived high stress reactivity showed poorer results in health-related complaints, depression, anxiety, sports behaviour, chronic stress, and effort-reward imbalance. The educational status of employees with perceived low stress reactivity is higher. Education, cardiovascular complaints, chronic stress, and effort-reward imbalance were moderate predictors for perceived stress reactivity. However, no relationship was found between stress reactivity and cardiovascular risk factors in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: Job stress is a major burden in a relevant subgroup of industrial employees in a middle management position. Self-perceived stress reactivity seems to be an appropriate concept to identify employees who experience psychosocial stress and associated psychological problems at the workplace.",

Poor phonological awareness is considered the major cause for the emergence of reading difficulties. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined the brain correlates of phonological processing in young beginning readers (aged 8.3+/-0.4 y, 2nd grade) with poor (<25th percentile) or normal, age-appropriate reading skills (>40th percentile) using a covert reading and mental letter substitution task. Letter substitution in words and nonwords induced pronounced activity in a left frontal language network related to phonological processing, with maxima in the left inferior frontal gyrus and in the insula. The activation within this frontal network increased with better reading skills and differentiated between normal and poor reading young children. Lateralization indices of overall frontal activity for normal and poor readers pointed to stronger left hemispheric involvement in normal readers as compared to the more bilateral activation pattern in poor readers. To summarize, young children with age-appropriate reading skills display a left hemispheric dominance characteristic for language processing already by grade two. The more bilateral activation pattern in poor readers points to an increased effort and the emergence of compensatory strategies for reading and phonological processing just 1.5 years after the start of formal reading instruction.",

METHODS: Children and adolescents undergoing cardiac, orthopaedic or craniofacial surgery with major blood loss were included. A 4.5 Fr two-lumen or 5.5 Fr three-lumen central venous oximetry catheter (SPediaSatcvO2) was inserted preoperatively into the superior vena cava. After in-vivo calibration of the PediaSat system, repeated blood samples were obtained from the distal port of the venous catheter and oximetrically analysed for haemoglobin and central venous oxygen saturation (SCO-OXcvO2). Central venous oxygen saturation values measured by the PediaSat (SPediaSatcvO2) were compared with co-oximetry (SCO-OXcvO2) values from the simultaneously taken blood samples by Bland-Altman and simple regression analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 142 data pairs from 27 patients, aged from 0.6 to 19.0 years (median 5.3 years) were analysed. SPediaSatcvO2 and SCO-OXcvO2 values ranged from 57 to 98% and from 57.1 to 95.8%, respectively. Correlation between SPediaSatcvO2 and SCO-OXcvO2 was poor with r equal to 0.28 (P < 0.0001). SPediaSatcvO2 overestimated SCO-OXcvO2 (mean bias +2.6%), but limits of agreement (+/-2 SD of bias) were unacceptably high (-14.4/+19.6%). Sensitivity and specificity of SPediaSatcvO2 to indicate a fall or rise of SCO-OXcvO2 between two subsequent measurements were only 0.42 and 0.24, respectively. CONCLUSION: In paediatric and adolescent patients undergoing major surgery, the PediaSat system did not reliably reflect SCO-OXcvO2 values and cannot replace repeated invasive ScvO2 assessments in the clinically relevant range of ScvO2.",

        "document": "Title: The Fed-model and the changing correlation of stock and bond returns: An equilibrium approach\nAbstract: This paper presents an equilibrium model that provides a rational explanation for two features of data that have been considered puzzling: The positive relation between US dividend yields and nominal interest rates, often called the Fed-model, and the time-varying correlation of US stock and bond returns. Key ingredients are time-varying first and second moments of consumption growth, inflation, and dividend growth in conjunction with Epstein-Zin and Weil recursive preferences. Historically in the US, inflation has signalled low future consumption growth. The representative agent therefore dislikes positive inflation shocks and demands a positive risk premium for holding assets that are poor inflation hedges, such as equity and nominal bonds. As a result, risk premiums on equity and nominal bonds comove positively through their exposure to macroeconomic volatility. This generates a positive correlation between dividend yields and nominal yields and between stock and bond returns. High levels of macro volatility in the late 1970s and early 1980s caused stock and bond returns to comove strongly. The subsequent moderation in aggregate economic risk has brought correlations lower. The model is able to produce correlations that can switch sign by including the covariances between consumption growth, inflation, and dividend growth as state variables.",

AIS occurred in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 63 participants and in all cases was associated with lesions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The lesion was cortical-subcortical in 30 out of 63 children, cortical in 25 out of 63, and subcortical in 8 of 63 children. Among participants with AIS in the posterior circulation territory, the stroke was cortical-subcortical in 8 out of 16, cortical in 5 of 16, and thalamic in 3 out of 16 children. \r\n\r\nInterpretation: AIS mainly involves the anterior circulation territory, with both the ACA and the MCA being affected. The classification of Ganesan is an appropriate population-based classification for our Swiss cohort, but the neuroimaging pattern alone is insufficient to determine the aetiology of stroke in a paediatric population. The results show a poor correlation between lesion pattern and aetiology.",

Finally, we consider the problem of multiple testing, which has witnessed a burgeoning literature in recent years. Along the way, we incorporate some examples that are current in the econometrics literature. While many problems with well-known successful solutions are included, we also address open problems that are not easily handled with current technology, stemming from such issues as lack of optimality or poor asymptotic approximations.",

It results from mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. Phenotypes can vary from a very mild increase in blood phenylalanine concentrations to a severe classic phenotype with pronounced hyperphenylalaninaemia, which, if untreated, results in profound and irreversible mental disability. Neonatal screening programmes identify individuals with phenylketonuria. The initiation of a phenylalanine-restricted diet very soon after birth prevents most of the neuropsychological complications. However, the diet is difficult to maintain and compliance is often poor, especially in adolescents, young adults, and pregnant women. Tetrahydrobiopterin stimulates phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in about 20% of patients, and in those patients serves as a useful adjunct to the phenylalanine-restricted diet because it increases phenylalanine tolerance and allows some dietary freedom. Possible future treatments include enzyme substitution with phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which degrades phenylalanine, and gene therapy to restore phenylalanine hydroxylase activity.",

We assume that there is a large set of assets which all\r\npromise a risk-less payo but which distinguish themselves by the collateral requirement. In equilibrium agents default and the assets have dierent payoffs. Assets with very low collateral requirements can be interpreted as sub-prime loans and these assets are often traded actively in the competitive equilibrium. If there is an abundance of commodities that can be used as collateral and if each agent\r\nowns a large fraction of these commodities, markets are complete and competitive equilibrium allocations Pareto optimal. If, on the other hand, the collateralizable durable good is scarce or if some agents do not own enough of the collateralizable durable good in the first\r\nperiod, markets can be endogenously incomplete, not all of the available assets are traded in the competitive equilibrium and allocations are not Pareto optimal. We give examples that show that welfare losses can be quantitatively large.\r\nWe also examine the scope for government intervention. In particular we ask who in the economy gains and who loses if collateral requirements are regulated exogenously. In our\r\nexamples, regulation never leads to a Pareto-improvement. Often, the rich and the poor agents gain if trade is restricted to subprime contracts and lose if trade in these contracts is not allowed.",

The priority of access (PoA)\r\nmodel (Altmann, Ann NY Acad Sci 102:338\u2013435, 1962)\r\nhas been the most influential framework in primates living\r\nin permanent, mixed-sex groups, but to date it has only\r\nbeen tested with the appropriate data on female synchrony\r\nin a handful of species. In this paper, we used mating data\r\nfrom one large semi-free ranging group of Barbary\r\nmacaques: (1) to provide the first test of the priority-of-access model in this species, using mating data from 11\r\nsexually active females (including six females that were\r\nimplanted with a hormonal contraceptive but who showed\r\nlevels of sexual activity comparable to those of naturally\r\ncycling females) and (2) to determine the proximate\r\nmechanism(s) underlying male mating skew. Our results\r\nshow that the fit of the observed distribution of matings\r\nwith sexually attractive females to predictions of the PoA\r\nmodel was poor, with lower-ranking males mating more\r\nthan expected. While our work confirms that female\r\nmating synchrony sets an upper limit to monopolization\r\nby high-ranking individuals, other factors are also important.\r\nCoalitionary activity was the main tactic used by males\r\nto lower mating skew in the study group. Coalitions were\r\nexpressed in a strongly age-related fashion and allowed\r\nsubordinate, post-prime males to increase their mating\r\nsuccess by targeting more dominant, prime males. Conversely,\r\nfemales, while mating promiscuously with several males during a given mating cycle, were more likely to initiate their consortships with prime males, thus reducing the overall effectiveness of coalitions. We conclude that\r\nhigh-ranking Barbary macaque males have a limited ability to monopolize mating access, leading to a modest\r\nmating skew among them.",

Furthermore, it aimed to analyse whether work-life conflicts correlate with the health of physicians, as it does in the general working population. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study analysed data from 2007 originating from the SwissMedCareer Study (a prospective cohort study of physicians who graduated in 2001; n = 543) and the Swiss Household Panel (a representative Swiss survey on living and working conditions; university graduates of the same age range: n = 172, general working population of the same age range: n = 670). Data were analysed with Chi2 tests, correlations and logistic regressions. RESULTS: Physicians reported strong time-based as well as strain-based work-life conflicts more frequently than university graduates and the general working population. Significantly more physicians reported \"moderate\" to \"very poor\" health than the other two samples. Surprisingly, on the other side of the scale (\"very good\" health), physicians outnumbered the other samples too. Strong associations between work-life conflict and self-rated health as well as various health complaints were found for physicians. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of work-life conflicts may explain the comparably high prevalence of poor self-rated health in the physicians' sample.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred twenty-five patients stratified into risk groups A (early bone marrow [BM] relapses), B (late BM relapses), and C (isolated extramedullary relapses) received alternating short-course intensive polychemotherapy (in blocks R1, R2, or R3) and cranial/craniospinal irradiation followed by maintenance therapy. Block R3 (high-dose cytarabine and etoposide) was introduced to improve the outcome compared with historical controls. Patients with early BM or T-ALL relapse (poor prognosis group [PPG]) were eligible for experimental regimens. One hundred seventeen patients received stem-cell transplantation (SCT). RESULTS: The probabilities (and standard deviations) of event-free survival (pEFS) and overall survival (pOS) at 10 years were 0.30 +/- .02 and 0.36 +/- .02, respectively. Significant differences existed between strategic groups (pEFS(A) = .17 +/- .03; pEFS(B) = .43 +/- .04; pEFS(C) = .54 +/- .06; pEFS(PPG) = .15 +/- .03; log-rank P < .001). Patients of high-risk groups A plus PPG did better with SCT than with chemotherapy (pEFS = .33 +/- .05 v 0.20 +/- .05; P = .005). The pEFS was similar to trials ALL-REZ BFM 85/87 (.36 +/- .03. v 0.37 +/- .03; P = .419; PPG excluded). Time point, site of relapse, immunophenotype, and SCT were significant predictors of pEFS in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: More than one third of patients in this large, population-based trial were cured. Neither R3 nor adaptation of chemotherapy intensity was capable of improving pEFS or of overcoming prognostic factors. In high-risk patients, remission induction regimens must be improved, and allogeneic SCT should be recommended in patients achieving second complete remission.",

However, the extent to which these associations may have already emerged and developed in childhood remains unclear. Methods: A total of 82 preschoolers (age 4.91 \u00b1 0.48) underwent activity monitoring for seven consecutive days and nights, wearing a digital movement-measuring instrument. Additionally, on the first and on the last morning of sleep registration, the activity of the HPA axis was assessed via the amount of cortisol in the saliva. Psychological and behavioral assessments were also made. Results: Three sub-groups of good (22%), normal (58.5%) and poor (19.5%) sleepers were distinguished. Poor sleep patterns were associated with higher HPA activity and with behavioral/emotional difficulties. Conclusions: The interplay between unfavorable sleep patterns, deterioration of the HPA axis and behavioral/emotional difficulties is already apparent in pre-school children",

        "document": "Title: Impact of preoperative right-ventricular function and platelet transfusion on outcome after lung transplantation\nAbstract: Objective: Lung transplantation has become an established treatment option for end-stage pulmonary diseases. However, outcome depends on preoperative condition and co-morbidity. Furthermore, perioperative blood-product use is known to be associated with worse outcome even in transplant surgery. We investigated the impact of poor preoperative right-ventricular function and blood-product use on outcome after lung transplantation. Methods: The medical records of 169 lung-transplant recipients from 1996 to 2006 were examined. Duration of hospital stay, hours on mechanical ventilation, duration of stay in the intensive care unit, perioperative complications, death during hospital stay, and long-term survival were recorded. These outcome parameters were analyzed regarding coherence with right-ventricular function and the perioperative administration of crystalloids, colloids, allogeneic red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. Results: Patients with poor preoperative right-ventricular function had a significant increase in postoperative hours on ventilation (p=0.005), intensive care stay (p=0.003), and in-hospital death (p=0.012). The hours on ventilation increased also with high intra-operative fluid administration (p=0.026). Blood-product use was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care stay. After multivariate analysis, transfusion of platelets (p=0.022) was an independent prognostic factor for in-hospital death. Hours of mechanical ventilation was the only independent prognostic factor for long-term mortality (p=0.014). Conclusions: Perioperative transfusion of platelets is an independent prognostic factor for perioperative mortality. Furthermore, the study indicated that poor preoperative right-ventricular function might worsen perioperatively after lung transplantation. Therefore, pre-transplant treatment of pulmonary hypertension to protract right-ventricular failure and a restrictive use of allogeneic blood products may be options to improve outcome.\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

We explore conditions under which near-subsistence scenarios may imply wage traps, labor market failures that can be the cause of undernourishment, illiteracy, and child labor. After stating general conditions under which wage traps occur, we look at specific production functions typically employed in quantitative analyses of growth and development. We find that standard Cobb-Douglas production functions do not permit wage traps, whereas CES functions do. Beyond that it turns out that when subsistence requirements increase with work hours, and when work effort rises with the wage rate, up to the efficiency-wage threshold, wage traps become more likely. Measures such as bans on child labor, implementation of minimum wage laws, or the establishment of labor unions may quite effectively improve conditions in wage-trapped labor markets.",

We documented the clinical features and outcome of 48 patients with IRAK-4 deficiency and 12 patients with MyD88 deficiency, from 37 kindreds in 15 countries.The clinical features of IRAK-4 and MyD88 deficiency were indistinguishable. There were no severe viral, parasitic, and fungal diseases, and the range of bacterial infections was narrow. Noninvasive bacterial infections occurred in 52 patients, with a high incidence of infections of the upper respiratory tract and the skin, mostly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. The leading threat was invasive pneumococcal disease, documented in 41 patients (68%) and causing 72 documented invasive infections (52.2%). P. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus documented invasive infections also occurred (16.7% and 16%, respectively, in 13 and 13 patients, respectively). Systemic signs of inflammation were usually weak or delayed. The first invasive infection occurred before the age of 2 years in 53 (88.3%) and in the neonatal period in 19 (32.7%) patients. Multiple or recurrent invasive infections were observed in most survivors (n = 36/50, 72%).Clinical outcome was poor, with 24 deaths, in 10 cases during the first invasive episode and in 16 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. However, no death and invasive infectious disease were reported in patients after the age of 8 years and 14 years, respectively. Antibiotic prophylaxis (n = 34), antipneumococcal vaccination (n = 31), and/or IgG infusion (n = 19), when instituted, had a beneficial impact on patients until the teenage years, with no seemingly detectable impact thereafter.IRAK-4 and MyD88 deficiencies predispose patients to recurrent life-threatening bacterial diseases, such as invasive pneumococcal disease in particular, in infancy and early childhood, with weak signs of inflammation. Patients and families should be informed of the risk of developing life-threatening infections; empiric antibacterial treatment and immediate medical consultation are strongly recommended in cases of suspected infection or moderate fever. Prophylactic measures in childhood are beneficial, until spontaneous improvement occurs in adolescence.",

As the perceived and real spectrum of health risks related to international travel increase both quantitatively and qualitatively, the need for more discriminating tools in clinical assessment for the purpose of mitigation, public health management, and research are needed. One group of international travelers identified as having increased risk of poor travel-related health outcomes are those who travel with the specific intent of visiting friends or relatives (VFR travelers). Due to variations in defining VFR travel in the health context there are issues in applying this designation uniformly from multiple perspectives. This article supports the standardization of VFR traveler definitions based on objective criteria and provides illustrations of the application of this definition through an illustrated approach to risk assessment based on these criteria and the differentials in the determinants of health between source and destination regions.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: A working group was established by the Migration Health Sub-committee, International Society for Travel Medicine to assess the literature on VFR travel and health, review an evidence-based approach to managing health risk related to travel, and to propose criteria-based definition for VFR travel. The new definition of a VFR is a traveler whose primary purpose of travel is to visit friends or relatives where there is a gradient of epidemiological risk between home and destination.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: A case scenario discussion of VFR travel defined by criteria and risk assessment based on differential determinants of health is presented in this article.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: The goal of this article is to encourage discussion on travel health evaluation for the most \"at risk\" populations and to standardize the application of clinical, public health, and research approaches to defining VFR travelers in a risk management context.",

In dogs, it is an uncommon condition, with German shepherd dogs showing a predisposition. Chronic mesenteric volvulus has also been described. In cats, previous reports have documented two cases of small intestinal volvulus, both diagnosed at necropsy, and a further case of volvulus of the colon in a patient that died after surgery. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This report describes two cats with mesenteric volvulus that were successfully treated. To the authors' knowledge, no reports of antemortem diagnosis or treatment of small intestinal volvulus in cats have previously been published. On the basis of the cases presented, it appears that the diagnosis of intestinal volvulus may be more difficult in cats than in dogs, but that the prognosis may not be as poor. Therefore, it is suggested that owners be encouraged to pursue surgery.",

Clinical features, disease course and immunohistochemical profile\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Cutaneous angiosarcoma (AS) is a rare malignant tumour of endothelial origin with very poor prognosis, frequent recurrences and high metastatic potential. Clinical suspicion is often raised too late, but histological findings and immunohistochemical assays have proved to be very helpful in the diagnostic process.\r\n\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Over the last 13 years, nine patients with AS were found in our archives. Clinical features, evolution, treatment and outcome were analysed and all biopsy specimens were reviewed by a trained dermatopathologist, with subsequent immunohistochemical assessment.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous AS was clinically diagnosed in 4 of 9 patients, while systemic lupus erythematosus was the most common misdiagnosis. Radiotherapy was the most prescribed treatment, but many different combinations of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were observed. Mean disease-free and overall survival (15.4 and 23.7 respectively) were consistent with previous series, with local recurrence rate (2/9) lower than previously reported data. CD31 was positive in all patients. Vimentin, D2-40 and VEGFR-3 were expressed by the vast majority, Factor VIII by 3/7 and CD34 by about 1/3 of patients. Cytokeratin was negative in all patients. The patients with the most unfavourable course showed a strong expression of Ki-67, while those with the best outcome only had a slight positive Ki-67 staining. Larger studies regarding tumour cell expression of Ki-67 and other markers such as D2-40 will be helpful to evaluate a potential prognostic value of these stainings.",

With panel data on doctoral graduates in 2002 (drawn from the Swiss Graduate Survey 2003 and 2007) we identify the poorer integration of female emerging researchers in international academic networks and the related differences in social capital as a major cause for gender specific drop-out rates.",

Psychosocial adversities pose a significant risk for criminal behaviour. So far, the nature of psychosocial adversities experienced by migrant youth is understudied. The aim of this study was to explore differences in psychosocial background in three ethnic groups (Turkish, former-Yugoslavian and Austrian) of detained juveniles in Austria. A semi-structured interview (Multidimensional Clinical Screening Inventory for delinquent juveniles, MCSI) was used to assess psychosocial background (e.g., trauma, family background, forensic and psychiatric family history, school history, psychiatric treatment received and criminal history) in juveniles entering an Austrian pre-trial detention facility. Of the 370 eligible participants, the final study sample consisted of 278 juveniles. The ethnic distribution was as follows: 55.4% Austrian (mean age 16.88 years, S.D. = 1.52), 14% Turkish (mean age 16.28 years, S.D. = 1.23), 30.6% former-Yugoslavian (mean age 16.47 years, S.D. = 1.41). In the Austrian sample, family dysfunction was significantly more prevalent than in the Turkish or former-Yugoslavian samples. Mental health services were significantly less used by juveniles with migration background. Turkish juveniles had a significantly poorer school performance than Austrians. Juveniles from former-Yugoslavia had significantly less often attended schools offering secondary education. The results suggest that detained juveniles with migration background are poorly integrated into the educational and mental health system of the host society. Family systems, even if substantially dysfunctional, seem to be perceived as more stable by migrant youth than by Austrian youth.",

An optimal pharmacological management in these patients is of major importance and antiplatelet agents remain the cornerstone of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) therapy at hospital admission and during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The recently described poor biological responses to aspirin and clopidogrel have been source of major concern, especially in era of drug eluting stent implantation. Indeed, insufficient platelet inhibition at the time of PCI has been consistently associated with an increased risk of complications and recurrence of ischemic events. Despite the lack of uniformly accepted definitions of aspirin and clopidogrel poor response, we sought to describe the current evidence and gaps in knowledge. While trials on the potential benefit of an increased antiplatelet maintenance dose after PCI have shown only marginal benefits, the strengthening of the initial antiplatelet regimens by additional loading doses of clopidogrel, by the administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors or phosphodiesterase inhibitors might further improve outcomes during ACS and PCI in patients with poor responsiveness to conventional dual antiplatelet therapy. Overall, tailoring the antiplatelet treatment on the basis of the individual biological response improves the short-term outcome after PCI. New and more potent antiplatelet drugs may overcome the clinical consequences of the poor response to antiplatelet agents.",

Drawing on an innovative livelihoods perspective with a focus on institutions, the author illustrates how the Kyrgyz agrarian reforms of the 1990s have fundamentally altered rural property relations. Analyzing quantitative and qualitative empirical data obtained between 2006 and 2009 in two case study villages in Naryn oblast, the study reveals how the reforms have not only redefined the economic value and social significance of land and other resources, but also the livelihood prospects of the rural population. Existing disparities between the asset-rich and the asset-poor have been reinforced, and their social relations have increasingly become embedded in a poorly regulated economic system. Wealthy and powerful households are therefore able to extend their property rights over land, pastures and other resources, while the less powerful struggle against various forms of uncertainties, which seriously undermine their prospects to escape the vicious cycle of short-term coping and resource depletion. The study thus provides a vivid example of the long-term effects of an agrarian \u2018shock therapy\u2019 and shows how the introduction of seemingly \u2018robust\u2019 institutions runs the risk of widening the existing gap between the rich and the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNach zwanzig Jahren Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit und weitreichenden Agrarreformen ist das l\u00e4ndliche Kirgistan weiterhin von weit verbreiteter Armut und grossen Ungleichheiten zwischen Arm und Reich gepr\u00e4gt. Mit einem Fokus auf die Wechselwirkungen zwischen Lebensunterhaltsstrategien und Institutionen geht die vorliegende Studie den Gr\u00fcnden dieser Stagnation nach und zeigt auf, wie l\u00e4ndliche Eigentumsverh\u00e4ltnisse durch die Kirgisischen Agrarreformen der 1990er Jahre fundamental ver\u00e4ndert wurden. Die Analyse quantitativer und qualitativer Daten, welche zwischen 2006 und 2008 in zwei Fallstudien-D\u00f6rfern im Naryn Oblast erhoben wurden, offenbart dabei, wie die Reformen nicht nur den \u00f6konomischen Wert und die soziale Bedeutung von Land und anderern nat\u00fcrlichen Ressourcen, sondern auch die Perspektiven der l\u00e4ndlichen Bev\u00f6lkerung ver\u00e4ndert haben. Unter dem Eindruck eines nur sehr schwach regulierten Wirtschaftssystems verfestigten sich bereits bestehende Disparit\u00e4ten zwischen Arm und Reich.

Several control measures, such as fasciolicide treatment or pasture management strategies have been described.\r\nThis study compares an adjusted control strategy accounting for the specific epidemiological situation on farms and a group of comparable farms where poor or no control was implemented.\r\nMaterials and Methods: A total of 32 premises infected by Fasciola hepatica were visited in summer 1999 or 2000 and in summer 2004. The autochthonal parasite cycle was demonstrated based on coproscopy and the presence of F. hepatica DNA in the intermediate host Lymnaea truncatula (by quantitative real-time PCR).\r\nThe farms were given recommendations for the control of fasciolosis based on the location of the snail habitats on the first visit. Of the 32 farms, 12 farms were recommended treatment of the animals with triclabendazole. For the remaining 20 farms a pasture rotation system was recommended. During the second visit of the farms they were divided into two compliance groups: Good and poor compliance.\r\nOn both visits, faecal samples from five cows were collected and coproscopy was conducted. On the second visit, additionally, blood samples of all cattle were examined for antibodies against F. hepatica using a commercial test kit (ELISA Fascioliasis Serum and Milk Verification, Institut Pourquier, Montpellier).\r\nThe outcome was assessed depending on the compliance to an integral control strategy compared to poor and no control at all.\r\nResults: A total of 15 farmers had followed the control recommendations whilst the remaining 17 farmers had not implemented Fasciola-prophylaxis as recommended.\r\nOn farms with inadequate Fasciola-prophylaxis the prevalence did not change. On the farms following the control recommendations the percentage of positive faecal samples decreased from 30.7 to 9.3 % (P = 0.003, x2). On the farms complying to the recommended control strategies, the mean seroprevalence in cattle was 21.4 %, on the farms with poor compliance 62.1 % (P <0.001, x2). The results of the multivariate linear regression model confirmed that the decrease in seroproevalence was associated with good compliance.\r\nConclusions: Complying with the control recommendations appeared to significantly affect the presence of F. hepatica in the definite host.",

There are reports of poorer patient outcome in transplant candidates with high MELD score, others though report no influence of MELD score on outcome and survival.\r\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 144 consecutive liver transplant recipients over a 72-month period in our transplant unit, from January 2003 until December 2008 and performed uni- and multivariate analysis for morbidity and mortality, in particular to define the influence of MELD to these parameters.\r\nRESULTS: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by intensive care unit (ICU) stay longer than 10 days (odds ratio 7.0) but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. Furthermore, we identified transfusion of more than 7 units of red blood cells as independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio 7.6) and for prolonged ICU stay (odds ratio [OR] 7.8) together with transfusion of more than 10 units of fresh frozen plasma (OR 11.6). Postoperative renal failure is a strong predictor of morbidity (OR 7.9) and postoperative renal replacement therapy was highly associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio 6.8), as was hepato renal syndrome prior to transplantation (hazard ratio 13.2).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by ICU stay longer than 10 days but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. This finding supports the transplantation of patients with high MELD score but only with knowledge of increased morbidity.",

We performed a systematic review to assess the effect of single and combined interventions on cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and HbA1c levels in patients with diabetes in PC settings. Methods We searched the MEDLINE database from January 1990 through October 2008. According to the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group (EPOC) criteria, (cluster-) randomised control studies and controlled before-and-after studies were selected and reviewed. Identified interventions were classified according to a modified EPOC intervention taxonomy. Results We included 68 studies. 45 studies evaluated the effect of any intervention on HbA1c. 17 studies presented a significant improvement in HbA1c. Nine out of 27 studies evaluating CVRFs (Cholesterol, Blood Pressure) and HbA1c showed a significant improvement in at least two of these factors. Audit and feedback on performance, clinical decision support systems, multi-professional teams and patient education seemed to be successful strategies. Conclusions The increasing evidence regarding the treatment of persons with chronic illnesses, summarised in the Chronic Care Model (CCM), is not reflected in most recent studies about diabetes treatment in primary care. Most interventions still seem only partly adapted to the CCM. The methodological quality of many studies is still poor and often the pivotal outcomes CVRFs and HbA1c are not appropriately addressed. As a consequence, the potential of PC in the care of patients with diabetes may still be underestimated.",

Structurally complex constitutes a new definition of complex karyotype characterized by more than or equal to 3 chromosomal aberrations, including at least one structural aberration. Five-year overall survival in patients with more than or equal to 3 clonal aberrations, which were not structurally complex, did not differ from that observed in patients with normal karyotype. Cox regression analysis revealed the presence of a monosomal and structurally complex karyotype to be strongly associated with poor prognosis (hazard ratio = 4.6, P < .01). Notably, a structurally complex karyotype without a monosomy was associated with a very short 2-year overall survival probability of only 14% (hazard ratio = 14.5; P < .01). The presence of a structurally complex karyotype was the strongest independent prognostic marker predicting poor outcome in children with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome.",

Violations of human dignity are brought about by concrete practices and conditions; some commonly acknowledged, such as torture and rape, and others more contested, such as poverty and exclusion. This volume collates reflections on such concepts and a range of practices, deepening our understanding of human dignity and its violation, bringing to the surface interrelationships and commonalities, and pointing to the values that are thereby shown to be in danger. In presenting a streamlined discussion from a negative perspective, complemented by conclusions for a positive account of human dignity, the book is at once a contribution to the body of literature on what dignity is and how it should be protected as well as constituting an alternative, fresh and focused perspective relevant to this significant recurring debate.",

This paper finds that recruitment into agencies is meritocratic where (1) agency officials have poor outside options, (2) careers in agencies are long-lasting, and (3) agency loyalty is important. Moreover, agency competence is lower when (4) loyalty is important but the time horizon is short, and (5) outside opportunities improve but the time horizon is long.

The evidence base on risk factors for poor outcomes in these patients is scarce. Our aim was to identify predictors of outcome in AKI patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis (IHD).\r\n\r\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patient records from consecutive, critically ill patients with AKI treated with IHD in one teaching secondary care hospital from 2002 to 2006. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to identify predictors of mortality, hemodynamical instability during hemodialysis and failing renal recovery.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Totally, we included 39 patients with a mean APACHE II score of 20.1 (SD 7.5) who had an average of 5.1 +/- 4.8 hemodialysis sessions. All-cause mortality was 35.9% (14/39 patients). In multivariate analysis, pre-existing cardiac co-morbidity (HR 1.92 [0.58-6.47]), metabolic acidosis (2.40 [0-74-7.74]) and presence of ARDS (1.83 [0.52-6.46]) were the strongest predictors. 7 patients (18%) sustained new hemodynamic instability during hemodialysis, for which ARDS (6.42 [0.64-64.03]) was a strong predictor. Among survivors, 20 patients (80%) had partial or complete renal recovery. Preexisting renal insufficiency (3.13 [0.34-29.13]) and high net ultrafiltration quantities (3.30 [0.40-26.90]) were the strongest predictors for failing renal recovery. As a consequence of the small samples size none of the associations was statistically significant.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Presence of ARDS and high net ultrafiltration rates seem to represent key factors affecting prognosis in patients with AKI undergoing IHD. Targeting these risk factors may improve the poor prognosis of these patients.",

There are types of dysplasia both with (B and D) and without (A and C) a supratrochlear spur. The aim of this study was to identify influencing factors for the clinical outcome following trochleoplasty.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Forty-four knees in 38 patients who underwent trochleoplasty for instability (type A in 9, B in 15, C in 9 and D in 11 knees) were assessed clinically with the Kujala score and radiologically with radiographs and MRI. The median follow-up was 4 (2-7.8) years.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: At follow-up, the median Kujala score had improved from 68 (29-84) to 90 (42-100) points (P < 0.001). Instability (P < 0.001) and pain (P = 0.027) decreased significantly, but in 3 knees, pain was worse postoperatively. Twenty-seven knees were ranked as excellent, 10 as good, 2 as fair and 5 as poor. Overall, dysplasia types B and D benefited more from surgery than types A and C. The postoperative MRI revealed no chondrolysis or subchondral necrosis, but deterioration of cartilage on the lateral trochlear facet was identified.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Trochleoplasty is a useful and reliable surgical technique to improve patellofemoral instability in patients with a dysplastic trochlea. While improved stability is predictable, pain is less predictable and may even increase following surgery. The overall results were directly dependent on the type of the dysplasia, with a significantly better clinical outcome in type B and D. The clinical relevance of this study is that severe dysplasia can successfully be treated with trochleoplasty.\r\n\r\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.",

The objective of this study was to provide a first estimate of the global incidence of this disease by country. The second objective was to estimate the global disease burden using age and gender stratified incidences and estimated life expectancy with the disease from previous results of survival analysis. Disability weights were suggested from previous burden studies on echinococcosis.\r\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook a detailed review of published literature and data from other sources. We were unable to make a standardised systematic review as the quality of the data was highly variable from different countries and hence if we had used uniform inclusion criteria many endemic areas lacking data would not have been included. Therefore we used evidence based stochastic techniques to model uncertainty and other modelling and estimating techniques, particularly in regions where data quality was poor. We were able to make an estimate of the annual global incidence of disease and annual disease burden using standard techniques for calculation of DALYs. Our studies suggest that there are approximately 18,235 (CIs 11,900-28,200) new cases of AE per annum globally with 16,629 (91%) occurring in China and 1,606 outside China. Most of these cases are in regions where there is little treatment available and therefore will be fatal cases. Based on using disability weights for hepatic carcinoma and estimated age and gender specific incidence we were able to calculate that AE results in a median of 666,434 DALYs per annum (CIs 331,000-1.3 million).\r\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The global burden of AE is comparable to several diseases in the neglected tropical disease cluster and is likely to be one of the most important diseases in certain communities in rural China on the Tibetan plateau.",

They\r\nperformed AH in hook-lying. Using M-mode ultrasound, thicknesses of TrA, and obliquus internus and externus were\r\ndetermined at rest and during 5 s AH (5 measures each\r\nbody side). The TrA contraction-ratio (TrA-CR) (TrA\r\ncontracted/rest) and the ability to sustain the contraction\r\n[standard deviation (SD) of TrA thickness during the stable\r\nphase of the hold] were investigated. There were no significant group differences for the absolute muscle thicknesses at rest or during AH, or for the SD of TrA thickness.\r\n\r\nThere was a small but significant difference between the\r\ngroups for TrA-CR: cLBP 1.35 \u00b1 0.14, controls 1.44 \u00b1\r\n0.24 (p\\0.05). However, Receiver Operator Characteristics\r\n(ROC) analysis revealed a poor and non-significant\r\nability of TrA-CR to discriminate between cLBP patients\r\nand controls on an individual basis (ROC area under the\r\ncurve, 0.60 [95% CI 0.495; 0.695], p = 0.08). In the patient\r\ngroup, TrA-CR showed a low but significant correlation\r\nwith Roland Morris score (Spearman Rho = 0.328; p = 0.02). In conclusion, the difference in group mean values for TrA-CR was small and of uncertain clinical relevance. Moreover, TrA-CR showed a poor ability to discriminate between control and cLBP subjects on an individual basis. We conclude that the TrA-CR during abdominal hollowing does not distinguish well between patients with chronic low back pain and healthy controls.",

Accurate cUS performance and interpretation is therefore required. AIMS: The aims of this study were (i) to assess the interobserver variability in cUS interpretation, and (ii) to evaluate whether level of cUS expertise influences the interobserver variability. METHODS: Fifty-eight cUS image series of preterm infants born below 32weeks of gestation collected within the Swiss Neonatal Network were sent to 27 observers for reviewing. Observers were grouped into radiologists, experienced neonatologists and less experienced neonatologists. Agreement between observers was calculated using Kappa statistics. RESULTS: When cystic periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular haemorrhagic infarction were combined to one outcome, agreement among all observers was moderate. When divided into subgroups, kappa for the combined outcome was 0.7 for experienced neonatologists, 0.67 for radiologists and 0.53 for inexperienced neonatologists. Marked difference in interobserver agreement between experienced neonatologists and radiologists could be found for haemorrhagic periventricular ifraction (HPI). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that interobserver agreement for interpretation of cUS varies from poor to good varying with the type of abnormality and level of expertise, suggesting that widespread structured training should be made available to improve the performance and interpretation of cUS.",

Results for adults indicate dominance of holistic viewing at brief timings,\r\nwhich is gradually replaced by feature selective strategies enabling them to selectively attend either internal\r\nor external features, as demanded by instruction. For children, however, effects of context and inversion are\r\nabsent at brief timings, but gradually increase to strong levels with increasing viewing times. Moreover, we\r\nfind a pronounced asymmetry in face matching performance with internal and external features. While face\r\nmatching by attending external features is well developed and robust against variable facial contexts, face\r\nmatching by attending internal features is generally poor, and strongly affected by interleaved congruent\r\nand incongruent contextual information. These results indicate that children and adults differ not only in\r\nthe kind of featural information they preferentially encode in face perception, but also in the processing\r\ntime they need to build holistic representations. While these are fast and automatic in adults\u2019 face vision,\r\nchildren\u2019s face representations are part based at brief timings, but develop to integrated wholes as more\r\ntemporal resources are made available.",

Methods\u2002 Seventy-one live-born newborn infants (24 triplet pregnancies) were prospectively enrolled at birth. At the age of 6\u2003years, 58 children (31 males, 27 females; mean gestational age 31.2wks [SD 2.2wks]; mean birthweight 1622g [SD 440g]) returned for a neurodevelopmental examination. A comparison group for triplets born before 32 gestational weeks comprising 26 gestational age-, birthweight-, and sex-matched singletons was also recruited (mean gestational age 30.1wk [SD 1.5wk]; mean birthweight 1142g [SD 210g]; 12 males, 14 females). The Zurich Neuromotor Assessment was used to examine motor performance, and intellectual abilities were assessed with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC). Results\u2002 Motor performance and movement quality in these individuals was significantly reduced compared with the test norms for all motor tasks (p<0.001) other than static balance. The mean values on the Mental Processing Composite (95.3, SD 8.4) and the Achievement Scale (90.1, SD 13.8) of the K-ABC were also lower than those in the test reference (p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively). Triplets born at less than 32\u2003weeks' gestation showed poorer pure motor and adaptive gross motor performance (both p<0.05) than, but similar intellectual performance to, the gestational age-, birthweight- and sex-matched singletons. Poor outcome was predicted by low socio-economic status and by intertriplet birthweight discordance (both p<0.01). Interpretation\u2002 Triplets were at an increased risk of mild motor and intellectual impairments. This finding is important for tailoring therapeutic interventions for these children and for parental counselling. Very preterm triplets showed similar outcomes to the singleton comparison children, except that they had poorer motor performance. Low socio-economic status was a major risk factor for impaired intellectual development. In addition, birthweight discordance may also be considered a predictor for poor long-term motor and intellectual outcome in triplets.",

Retrieval-related brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 20 healthy students, of which 12 were good learners and eight were poor learners. At the day lag, the poor learners exhibited enhanced neural recruitment in the hippocampus and neocortex to reach a retrieval performance comparable to that of the good learners. Over the 20 subjects, there was a positive correlation between retrieval-related hippocampal activity at the day lag and forgetting over the month retention interval (the greater the activity, the more forgetting). Although the poor learners' retrieval performance declined dramatically from the day to the month lag, the good learners maintained a high retrieval performance, which distinguishes them as good memory consolidators. Their retrieval-related hippocampal and neocortical activity increased from the day to the month lag. This increase was observed both when retrieval performance was matched between the day and the month lag and when the learning procedure for information retrieved at the day and the month lag was matched. This activity increase in the task-specialized neural network from the day lag to the month lag may reflect an increase in task demands or the proliferation of hippocampal-neocortical memory traces during memory consolidation as suggested by the multiple trace theory.",

The present study evaluated the association between cognitive dysfunction and major depressive disorder (MDD, N=70) as compared with age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n=206) and its relationship to general functioning (physical and mental health quality of life, activities of daily living, and employment status) in participants with current MDD (n=26) and those with previous MDD only (n=44). Participants were assessed clinically using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) for the depression groups and the Diagnostic Interview for Psychoses (DIP-DM) for the control group. Measures to evaluate cognition and quality of lifes comprised the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), the Short Form-36 Health Survey Questionnaire, and the Activities/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL/IADL); employment status was also assessed in MDD. The results showed that a) while individuals with current depression had worse cognitive performance in all domains than healthy controls, those individuals with previous depression had lasting cognitive impairments in the domains of immediate memory and attention as compared with healthy controls; b) individuals with current depression had lower scores in the visuospatial/constructional and attention domains and the total score than individuals with previous depression; c) individuals in the depression group as a whole who were currently unemployed had significantly lower scores in all domains (except attention) of cognitive function; d) cognitive function was not related to either physical or mental quality of life or impairments of activities of daily living (ADL, IADL); e) that unemployment in previous depression was related to poor cognitive function similar to those with current depression. The results indicate that MDD may have detrimental and lasting effects on cognitive performance partly related to poorer general functioning.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 11 children (mean age 6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 years) with neuropathic bladder and poor bladder compliance (mean 7\u2009ml/cmH(2) O) treated with intradetrusor injection of BoNT/A. After urodynamic evaluation a standardized injection was performed. The authors describe their results in 11 children after the first (5\u00d7) or repeated (6\u00d7) BoNT/A injections. Re-evaluation was performed 3 and 12 months after each injection. RESULTS: Three months after injection detrusor pressure decreased by 17% and bladder capacity increased by 33%. In all but 1 patient bladder compliance stayed poor. Twelve months after treatment patients still had an effect but the values were already reverting towards preoperative levels. With repeated injections we achieved a similar effect on capacity and detrusor pressure as after the first injection. Overall, bladder compliance normalized (>20\u2009cmH(2) O) in only 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed the positive temporary effect of BoNT/A on detrusor pressure and bladder capacity in children with myelomeningocele, even after repeated injections. Nevertheless, bladder compliance stayed severely pathological. Whether an earlier treatment may prevent poor bladder compliance is a yet unanswered question. Neurourol. Urodynam.",

        "document": "Title: Cystic echinococcosis\nAbstract: Cystic echinococcosis (CE)\\cystic hydatid disease is one of the most widespread and important global helminth zoonosis. The parasite Echinococcus granulosus, continues to be a cause and consequence of poverty through its impact on public health and animal production. Human behaviour is largely responsible for the perpetuation of the parasite which flourishes in low socio-economic regions of the world where there are poor veterinary and medical facilities and where home slaughter of livestock is performed and dogs go untreated. The parasite is maintained in a wide spectrum of intermediate hosts, including sheep, goats, camels, cattle, pigs and equines. A number of wild intermediate hosts occur, including cervids in the northern part of the North American continent and Eurasia, marsupials in Australia and wild herbivores in East and southern Africa. The application of a range of molecular techniques to the characterization of the parasite has confirmed the existence of mostly host-adapted strains and genotypes of the parasite. Several new species have been proposed which include: the sheep strain (E. granulosus, sensu stricto, G1, G2, G3), the horse strain (E. equinus, G4), the cattle strain (E. ortleppi, G5), the camel (G6) and pig (G7) strain (E.intermedius, G6, G7, G9), the cervid strain (E. canadensis, G8, G10) and the lion strain (E. felidis). All strains except the horse and lion strain are known to be infective to humans. The ubiquitous domestic dog serves as the most important definitive host for the transmission of the parasite throughout its wide geographical range. Lions, hyenas and jackals also serve as definitive hosts in the wildlife cycles in Africa, wolves, foxes and jackals in the northern hemisphere and dingoes in Australia.\r\nA wide range of diagnostic techniques, including necropsy, arecoline purgation, coproantigen ELISA and DNA based tests are available for detecting E. granulosus infection in the definitive host. The technique used will depend on the prevailing circumstances. Unfortunately this plethora of tests is not available for intermediate animal hosts where diagnosis at post mortem still remains the most reliable option. In humans, imaging techniques including ultrasound, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or computer aided tomography (CAT-scan provide not only a method of diagnosis but also reveal important clinical information on the location, condition, number and size of the hydatid cysts in man. The properties of ultrasound (little patient preparation time, no ionizing radiation, portable equipment, cost and wide application in medicine) has made it the most widely used diagnostic technique and is the only imaging technique for screening of populations in rural areas, where the disease is most common. With the increasing use of ultrasound for the diagnosis and screening of CE a classification system has been developed which can be used to assess the likely development of a cyst and hence guide the clinician in treatment options for the patient. The present international classification system is based on the evaluation of the WHO- Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis. This group also updated the recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of CE in 2009. As a result of a multidisciplinary approach treatment relies on surgery and/or percutaneous interventions, especially \u201cPuncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration\u201d(PAIR) and/or antiparasitic treatment with albendazole (and alternatively mebendazole). The treatment protocol is based on cyst type and number, organ location and presence/absence of complications.  A proper follow-up of the patients should assess the efficacy of the treatment, detect treatment complications, and timely disclose recurrences, which are not unusual, and are a major complication of the disease.\r\nCE is largely a preventable disease. Elimination programmes have focused on frequent periodic treatments of dogs with anthelmintics and the control of slaughter of domestic livestock. This has resulted in the elimination of the parasite from a number of island nations, including, New Zealand, Tasmania, Iceland and southern Cyprus.  In many regions elimination or even control remains a problem as the parasite is endemic over vast areas of low income countries where there may be limited resources for control. In some areas, such as former communist administered countries, the parasite is resurgent. New tools are becoming available to control the parasite, including a highly effective vaccine in sheep which prevents the infection in sheep and breaks the transmission cycle. In addition cost effective methods are being developed which may be appropriate in low income countries where financial resources are not available for intensive control programmes that have been successful in high income countries.",

Adjuvant chemotherapy increases disease-free and overall survival, but this treatment cannot be offered to a significant proportion of patients due to the surgical morbidity. In contrast, almost all patients can receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. This treatment is safe and effective, and has resulted in a median survival of 26.5 months in a recent phase II trial. Moreover, neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the nutritional status of patients with pancreatic cancer. This multicenter phase III trial (NEOPAC) has been designed to explore the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r\nMethods/Design This is a prospective randomized phase III trial. Patients with resectable cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head are eligible for this study. All patients must be at least 18 years old and must provide written informed consent. An infiltration of the superior mesenteric vein > 180\u00b0 or major visceral arteries are considered exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be randomized to surgery followed by adjuvant gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) for 6 months or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2) followed by surgery and the same adjuvant treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given four times every two weeks. The staging as well as the restaging protocol after neoadjuvant chemotherapy include computed tomography of chest and abdomen and diagnostic laparoscopy. The primary study endpoint is progression-free survival. According to the sample size calculation, 155 patients need to be randomized to each treatment arm. Disease recurrence will be documented by scheduled computed tomography scans 9, 12, 15, 21 and thereafter every 6 months until disease progression. For quality control, circumferential resection margins are marked intraoperatively, and representative histological sections will be centrally reviewed by a dedicated pathologist.

The captive population suffers from poor breeding success and is threatened to become overaged. Although several factors are likely to contribute to the poor breeding success, one in particular may be chronic stress associated with prolonged periods of high glucocorticoid (GC) output. We investigated fecal GC levels of pileated gibbons (Hylobates pileatus) and their relationship to specific life-history variables and environmental factors. After validation of an enzyme immunoassay for the measurement of 5-reduced 3\u03b1,11\u03b2-dihydroxy cortisol metabolites to assess GC output reliably in pileated gibbons, we collected fecal samples over several days from all 36 European adult pileated gibbons located in 11 institutions and comparedGC levels to intrinsic individual parameters, husbandry, behavior, and breeding history. Age, sex, and origin (wild vs. captive born) had no effect on GC levels. However, unnaturally reared gibbons had higher GC levels and showed more behavioral abnormalities than parent-reared individuals. Further, nonreproducing gibbons living in a pair without infants had higher GC concentrations than gibbons living in a family, bachelor group, or as singletons. With respect to environmental factors, a large size of the inside enclosure and the existence of visual protection from visitors was associated with lower fecal GC output. The data indicate that rearing and housing conditions appear to correlate to GC levels in pileated gibbons housed under captive conditions. It is hoped this knowledge will support the future management of the species in captivity and thus lead to a more successful breeding of this endangered primate.",

Orphanage rearing, even in the best circumstances, lies outside of the bounds of a species-typical caregiving environment. The long-term effects of this early adversity on the neurobiological development associated with socio-emotional behaviors are not well understood. Seventy-eight children, who include those who have experienced orphanage care and a comparison group, were assessed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure volumes of whole brain and limbic structures (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus). Emotion regulation was assessed with an emotional go-nogo paradigm, and anxiety and internalizing behaviors were assessed using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, the Child Behavior Checklist, and a structured clinical interview. Late adoption was associated with larger corrected amygdala volumes, poorer emotion regulation, and increased anxiety. Although more than 50% of the children who experienced orphanage rearing met criteria for a psychiatric disorder, with a third having an anxiety disorder, the group differences observed in amygdala volume were not driven by the presence of an anxiety disorder. The findings are consistent with previous reports describing negative effects of prolonged orphanage care on emotional behavior and with animal models that show long-term changes in the amygdala and emotional behavior following early postnatal stress. These changes in limbic circuitry may underlie residual emotional and social problems experienced by children who have been internationally adopted.",

        "document": "Title: Biological substrates of emotional reactivity and regulation in adolescence during an emotional go-nogo task\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a transition period from childhood to adulthood that is often characterized by emotional instability. This period is also a time of increased incidence of anxiety and depression, underscoring the importance of understanding biological substrates of behavioral and emotion regulation during adolescence. Developmental changes in the brain in concert with individual predispositions for anxiety might underlie the increased risk for poor outcomes reported during adolescence. We tested the hypothesis that difficulties in regulating behavior in emotional contexts in adolescents might be due to competition between heightened activity in subcortical emotional processing systems and immature top-down prefrontal systems. Individual differences in emotional reactivity might put some teens at greater risk during this sensitive transition in development.\r\nMETHODS: We examined the association between emotion regulation and frontoamygdala circuitry in 60 children, adolescents, and adults with an emotional go-nogo paradigm. We went beyond examining the magnitude of neural activity and focused on neural adaptation within this circuitry across time with functional magnetic resonance imaging.\r\nRESULTS: Adolescents showed exaggerated amygdala activity relative to children and adults. This age-related difference decreased with repeated exposures to the stimuli, and individual differences in self-ratings of anxiety predicted the extent of adaptation or habituation in amygdala. Individuals with higher trait anxiety showed less habituation over repeated exposures. This failure to habituate was associated with less functional connectivity between ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that exaggerated emotional reactivity during adolescence might increase the need for top-down control and put individuals with less control at greater risk for poor outcomes",

Traditional neurobiological and cognitive explanations for adolescent behavior have failed to account for the nonlinear changes in behavior observed during adolescence, relative to both childhood and adulthood. This review provides a biologically plausible model of the neural mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes in behavior. We provide evidence from recent human brain imaging and animal studies that there is a heightened responsiveness to incentives and socioemotional contexts during this time, when impulse control is still relatively immature. These findings suggest differential development of bottom-up limbic systems, implicated in incentive and emotional processing, to top-down control systems during adolescence as compared to childhood and adulthood. This developmental pattern may be exacerbated in those adolescents prone to emotional reactivity, increasing the likelihood of poor outcomes.",

One factor thought to influence adolescents' propensity for risk-taking is an enhanced sensitivity to appetitive cues, relative to an immature capacity to exert sufficient cognitive control. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing interactions among ventral striatal, dorsal striatal, and prefrontal cortical regions with varying appetitive load using fMRI scanning. Child, teen, and adult participants performed a go/no-go task with appetitive (happy faces) and neutral cues (calm faces). Impulse control to neutral cues showed linear improvement with age, whereas teens showed a nonlinear reduction in impulse control to appetitive cues. This performance decrement in teens was paralleled by enhanced activity in the ventral striatum. Prefrontal cortical recruitment correlated with overall accuracy and showed a linear response with age for no-go versus go trials. Connectivity analyses identified a ventral frontostriatal circuit including the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal striatum during no-go versus go trials. Examining recruitment developmentally showed that teens had greater between-subject ventral-dorsal striatal coactivation relative to children and adults for happy no-go versus go trials. These findings implicate exaggerated ventral striatal representation of appetitive cues in adolescents relative to an intermediary cognitive control response. Connectivity and coactivity data suggest these systems communicate at the level of the dorsal striatum differentially across development. Biased responding in this system is one possible mechanism underlying heightened risk-taking during adolescence.",

Biomarkers for the disease would be desirable in order to allow for an early detection of tumor progression or to indicate rapidly growing tumor subtypes requiring more intensive therapy. In this study, we investigated whether a blood-derived specific miRNA fingerprint can be defined in patients with glioblastoma. To this end, miRNA profiles from the blood of 20 patients with glioblastoma and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were compared. Of 1158 tested miRNAs, 52 were significantly deregulated, as assessed by unadjusted Student's t-test at an alpha level of 0.05. Of these, two candidates, miR-128 (up-regulated) and miR-342-3p (down-regulated), remained significant after correcting for multiple testing by Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment with a p-value of 0.025. The altered expression of these two biomarkers was confirmed in a second cohort of glioblastoma patients and healthy controls by real-time PCR and validated for patients who had received neither radio- nor chemotherapy and for patients who had their glioblastomas resected more than 6 months ago. Moreover, using machine learning, a comprehensive miRNA signature was obtained that allowed for the discrimination between blood samples of glioblastoma patients and healthy controls with an accuracy of 81% [95% confidence interval (CI) 78-84%], specificity of 79% (95% CI 75-83%) and sensitivity of 83% (95% CI 71-85%). In summary, our proof-of-concept study demonstrates that blood-derived glioblastoma-associated characteristic miRNA fingerprints may be suitable biomarkers and warrant further exploration.",

Reliable outcome-predictive markers and targets for osteosarcoma metastasis-suppressing drugs are urgently needed for more effective treatment of metastasizing osteosarcoma with a current mean 5-year survival rate of approximatly 20%. This study investigated the prognostic value and the biological relevance of the extracellular matrix-associated growth factor Cyr61 of the CCN family of secreted proteins in osteosarcoma and metastasis. The prognostic value of Cyr61 was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analyses based on Cyr61 immunostaining of a tissue microarray of osteosarcoma biopsies collected from 60 patients with local or metastatic disease. Effects of Cyr61 overexpression on intratibial tumor growth and lung metastasis of the low metastatic human SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line were examined in SCID mice. Cyr61 provoked signaling was studied in vitro in non-manipulated SaOS-2 cells. Cyr61 immunostaining of osteosarcoma tissue cores correlated significantly (P=0.02) with poor patient survival. Mice intratibially injected with Cyr61 overexpressing SaOS-2 cells showed faster tumor growth and an increase in number and outgrowth of lung metastases and consequently significantly (P=0.0018) shorter survival than mice injected with control SaOS-2 cells. Cyr61-evoked PI-3K/Akt/GSK3b signaling in SaOS-2 cells resulted in a sub-cellular redistribution of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1/WAF1) . Cyr61 has considerable potential as a novel marker for poor prognosis in osteosarcoma and is an attractive target for primary tumor and metastases suppressing drugs. \u00a9 2011 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

Moreover, (iv) cross-sectional data shows systematic expenditure structure difference between rich and poor households. Ngai and Pissarides (2006) and Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) are consistent with observation (i)-(iii) but abstract form non-homotheticities of preferences.

This paper presents a growth model, which reconciles both forces of structural change - relative price and income effects - with balanced growth on the aggregate. The theory is simple and parsimonious and contains an analytical solution. The model can replicate shape and magnitude of the nonbalanced sectoral facts as well as the balanced nature of growth on the aggregate. In a structural estimation, the model\u2019s functional form is exploited to obtain estimates for the relative importance of income and price effects as determinants of the structural change.",

Twelve client-owned dogs with DM were included. All dogs received insulin glargine every 12 hours for at least six months, re-evaluations were performed after one, two, four, eight, 12 and 24 weeks and included clinical signs, blood glucose curves (BGCs) and measurement of serum fructosamine concentrations. Mean blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower after two weeks of treatment and remained significantly lower for the duration of the study. By week 24, polyuria/polydipsia had improved in 91 per cent of the dogs. No clinical signs that could have been caused by hypoglycaemia were observed. Based on BGCs and remission of the clinical signs for judging the success of the treatment, 58, 33 and 8 per cent of the dogs attained good, moderate and poor glycaemic control by week 24 of the study, respectively. Insulin glargine administered subcutaneously twice daily is a possible and safe method of treatment for dogs with naturally occurring DM. Although only a few studies are available on the use of other types of insulin in dogs, their success rate is somewhat greater than that with insulin glargine.",

Adherence was assisted by personal adherence supporters. We estimated risk factors of death or loss to follow-up by Cox regression during the first 12 months of cART.\r\nResults Overall, 1,463 individuals initiated cART, which was nevirapine-based in 84.6%. The median age was 40 years (IQR 34-47), 35.4% were males, 7.6% had proven tuberculosis. Median CD4 cell count was 131 cells/\u03bcl and 24.8% had WHO stage 4. Median CD4 cell count increased by 61 and 130 cells/\u03bcl after 6 and 12 months, respectively. 215 (14.7%) patients modified their treatment, mostly due to toxicity (56%), in particular polyneuropathy and anemia. Overall, 129 patients died (8.8%) and 189 (12.9%) were lost to follow-up. In a multivariate analysis, low CD4 cells at starting cART were associated with poorer survival and loss to follow-up (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.15-2.75, p = 0.009; for CD4 <50 compared to >100 cells/\u03bcl). Higher weight was strongly associated with better survival (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.76, p < 0.001 per 10 kg increase).\r\nConclusions cART initiation at higher CD4 cell counts and better general health condition reduces HIV related mortality in a rural African setting. Efforts must be made to promote earlier HIV diagnosis to start cART timely. More research is needed to evaluate effective strategies to follow cART at a peripheral level with limited technical possibilities.",

We compare outcomes of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) and on-pump CABG (ONCABG) in patients with severely compromised EF. From 2004 to 2009, 478 patients with a decreased EF \u226435% underwent myocardial-revascularization. Patients received either OPCAB (n\u00a0=\u00a0256) or ONCABG (n\u00a0=\u00a0222). Propensity score (PS), including 50 preoperative risk-factors, was used to balance characteristics between groups. PS adjusted logistic regression analysis was performed to assess mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). A composite endpoint for major non-cardiac complications such as respiratory failure, renal failure, rethoracotomy was applied. Complete revascularization (CR) was assumed when the number of distal anastomoses was larger than that of diseased vessels. There was no difference for mortality (2.3 vs. 4.1%; PS-adjusted odds ratio (PS-OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.05; p\u00a0=\u00a00.93) and MACCE (13.7 vs. 17.6%; PS-OR\u00a0=\u00a01.22; p\u00a0=\u00a00.50) including myocardial-infarction (1.4 vs. 4.9%; PS-OR\u00a0=\u00a00.39; p\u00a0=\u00a00.26), low cardiac output (2.3 vs. 4.7%; PS-OR\u00a0=\u00a00.75; p\u00a0=\u00a00.72) and stroke (2.3 vs. 2.7%; PS-OR\u00a0=\u00a00.69; p\u00a0=\u00a00.66). OPCAB patients presented with a trend to less frequent occurrence of the non-cardiac composite (12.1 vs. 22.1%; PS-OR\u00a0=\u00a00.54; p\u00a0=\u00a00.059) including renal dysfunction (PAOR\u00a0=\u00a00.77; 95% CI 0.31-1.9; p\u00a0=\u00a00.57), bleeding (PAOR\u00a0=\u00a00.42; 95% CI 0.14-1.20; p\u00a0=\u00a00.10) and respiratory failure (PAOR\u00a0=\u00a00.39; 95% CI 0.05-3.29; p\u00a0=\u00a00.39). The rate of complete revascularization was similar (92.2 vs. 92.8%; PS-OR\u00a0=\u00a00.75; p\u00a0=\u00a00.50). OPCAB in patients with severely decreased EF is safe and feasible. It may even benefit these patients in regard to non-cardiac complications and does not come at cost of less complete revascularization.",

Little is known about the clinical outcomes of stroke patients weighing >100 kg, who may benefit less from thrombolysis due to this dose limitation. METHODS:  Prospective data on 1,479 consecutive stroke patients treated with intravenous alteplase in six Swiss stroke units were analyzed. Presenting characteristics and the frequency of favorable outcomes, defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 0 or 1, a good outcome (mRS score 0-2), mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) were compared between patients weighing >100 kg and those weighing \u2264100 kg. RESULTS:  Compared to their counterparts (n = 1,384, mean body weight 73 kg), patients weighing >100 kg (n = 95, mean body weight 108 kg) were younger (61 vs. 67 years, p < 0.001), were more frequently males (83 vs. 60%, p < 0.001) and more frequently suffered from diabetes mellitus (30 vs. 13%, p < 0.001). As compared with patients weighing \u2264100 kg, patients weighing >100 kg had similar rates of favorable outcomes (45 vs. 48%, p = 0.656), good outcomes (58 vs. 64%, p = 0.270) and mortality (17 vs. 12%, p = 0.196), and SICH risk (1 vs. 5%, p = 0.182). After multivariable adjustment, body weight >100 kg was strongly associated with mortality (p = 0.007) and poor outcome (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION:  Our data do not suggest a reduced likehood of favorable outcomes in patients weighing >100 kg treated with the current dose regimen. The association of body weight >100 kg with mortality and poor outcome, however, demands further large-scale studies to replicate our findings and to explore the underlying mechanisms.",

As a new approach in the frame of the \"Prediction in Ungauged Basins\" initiative, this study investigates the geographical transferability of different parameter sets and data-fusion methods which were applied to 5 different rainfall-runoff models for a low-land catchment in Central Sweden. After usual calibration, we adopted a proxy-basin validation approach between two similar but non-nested sub-catchments in order to simulate ungauged conditions.\r\nMany model combinations outperformed the best single model predictions with improvements of efficiencies from 0.70 for the best single model predictions to 0.77 for the best ensemble predictions. However no \"best\" data-fusion method could be determined as similar performances were obtained with different merging schemes. In general, poorer model performance, i.e. lower efficiency, was less likely to occur for ensembles which included more individual models.",

Thus, it depends on the ways of dealing with stress within a couple (dyadic coping). In this study, the relationship between dyadic coping and well-being was investigated among couples in which one partner suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\r\nMethods: A total of 43 couples participated. They were mailed questionnaires on anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-BREF), and dyadic coping (Dyadic Coping Inventory).\r\nResults: Low scores of positive and high scores of negative dyadic coping were associated with poorer quality of life and higher psychological distress among couples. Delegated coping (assistance with daily tasks) was higher among partners. When estimated by patients, high delegated partner coping (frequent provision of support by partners) and low delegated personal coping (low provision of support by patients) were associated with poorer quality of life for both patient and partner. COPD patients suffering from depression were supported more often and attributed deficits in dyadic coping primarily to themselves, whereas partners with higher scores of depression provided higher estimates of both their own negative coping and the negative coping of their partner.\r\nConclusion: The higher the patient perceived the imbalance in delegated dyadic coping, the lower the couple's quality of life. More negative and less positive dyadic coping were associated with lower quality of life and higher psychological distress. Psychotherapeutic interventions to improve dyadic coping may lead to better quality of life and less psychological distress among COPD patients and their partners.",

Though optimal labor distortions are history-dependent, i.e. depend on income and education, simple policy instruments can yield the desired distortions: a single nonlinear labor income tax schedule combined with income-contingent loans. To take themodel to the (US) data, we simplify the model to a binary education decision (graduating from college or not). We find that for lowand intermediate incomes the labor supply decision of college graduates should be distorted more heavily than for individuals without a college degree. As a consequence, the optimal student loan repayment schedule increases in income for this range. This result holds along the Pareto frontier. We compare the second best to a situation where loan repayment is restricted to be independent from income and find significant welfare gains.",

An Empirical Analysis of Household Survey Data from 1989 to 2006\nAbstract: Durable goods ownership is commonly seen as a \u2018defining gauge\u2019 for the stage of development of a country. Its unprecedented economic growth and the rise of a strong and steadily growing class of consumers make China a formidable case study for the investigation of durable goods diffusion. Drawing on a household-panel with a survey period from 1989 to 2006, the empirical analysis of the driving forces behind the diffusion of durable goods shows that growth of disposable income was not equally important for all goods in their diffusion process. Rather it was the fall of individual preference thresholds (explained in part by falling durable prices) that proved to have a significant influence on the diffusion process of some goods. As it turned out, this tendency was significantly stronger in rural areas and could have counterbalanced, therefore, welfare patterns in terms of ownership contrary to the stable urban-rural gap in economic performance. Apart from changes in income and durable prices, it was found, that improvement of public services had particularly strong effects for urban poor and in rural areas. A forecast exercise up to 2030 revealed that growth in ownership rates is expected to be particularly strong for durable goods like refrigerators and cars for which households already show (or are about to do so in the case of cars) high sensitivity towards further increases in their disposable income. For other durables, like colour TVs, that are already well spread in the population there are signs of saturation with lower expected growth rates of ownership. Additionally, ownership rates are expected to pick up stronger in rural areas were households are less saturated and show higher income elasticities. As a comparison with figures from the literature demonstrates, actual and projected ownership rates depend, to some degree, also on the choice of the data set. The projections based on CHNS data could, therefore, build a reference to other commonly used data sets from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics.",

In equilibrium, monopolistic producers set high (low) prices in rich (poor) countries but a threat of parallel trade restricts the scope of price discrimination between countries. The threat of parallel trade allows differences in per capita incomes to have a strong impact on the extensive margin of trade, whereas differences in population sizes have a weaker effect. We also show that the welfare gains from trade liberalization are biased towards rich countries. We extend our model to more than two countries; to unequal incomes within countries; and to more general specifications of non-homothetic preferences.

The lack of empirical support for nominally opposing claims can be reconciled if elements of both perspectives are partially correct. We use a formal model to construct an explanation linking economic development with interstate conflict that resolves contradictory theories and a relative paucity of evidence. Development increases the ability of states to project power while decreasing the willingness of states to engage in conflict over certain issues. High income states fight less often to conquer tangible assets or territory, but fight more often to compel adherence to preferred policies and to police the global commons.",

The theoretical predictions are that subjects follow their immediate predecessors in treatment sequence and follow the minority in treatment no-sequence (Callander and H\u00f6rner, 2009). The former prediction is borne out in the data, but subjects tend to follow the majority in treatment no-sequence. We observe substantial heterogeneity in levels of strategic thinking, as predicted by level-k and Cognitive Hierarchy. While these models reproduce some features of our data, their fit is poor because of the assumed best-response behavior. Allowing for some degree of 'trembling' improves the fit significantly, especially if subjects are aware that others tremble, as in logit-QRE.

A prototypical example for such a product cycle is the automobile. Initially an exclusive product for the very rich, the automobile became affordable to the middle class after the introduction of Ford's Model T, the car that 'put America on wheels'. We show that an egalitarian society creates strong incentives for process innovations (such as the Model T) whereas an unequal society creates strong incentives for product innovations (new luxuries).

Evidence from Russia\nAbstract: This paper reports the results of a series of competitive labour market experiments in which subjects have the possibility to reciprocate favours. In the high stake condition subjects earned between two and three times their monthly income during the experiment. In the normal stake condition the stake level was reduced by a factor of ten. We observe that both in the high and the normal stake condition fairness concerns are strong enough to outweigh competitive forces and give rise to non-competitive wages. There is also no evidence that effort behaviour becomes generally more selfish at higher stake levels. Therefore, our results suggest that, contrary to common beliefs, fairness concerns may play an important role even at relatively high stake levels.",

In this paper we pinpoint the shortcomings of standard models and propose two alternatives, namely generalized threshold and sequential models.

It is assumed that only a small elite, the oligarchs, may run firms and that these oligarchs \u2013 when borrowing from workers \u2013 may renege on the debt contracts at low cost. In such an economy, poor contract enforcement slows down the transition towards the steady state and alters the dynamics of the distribution strongly in favour of the oligarchs. The reason is that the workers are forced to charge \u201clow\u201d borrowing rates in order to decrease the incumbents\u2019 incentives to default. With dynastic preferences, low returns reduce the workers\u2019 propensity to save; they discount future wages less and consume more out of current income. Calibrations of the model suggest that the elite\u2019s welfare gains are large \u2013 even if the oligarchic structure were associated with substantially lower productivity growth rates. These findings point to political forces behind low financial development.\"",

Limited borrowing prevents the less affluent individuals from investing the efficient amount, and the inefficiencies are considered to become stronger as inequality rises. This paper, though, argues that higher inequality may actually boost aggregate output even with convex technologies and limited borrowing. Less equality in the middle or at the top end of the distribution is associated with a lower borrowing rate and hence better access to credit for the poor. We find, however, that rising relative poverty is unambiguously bad for economic performance. Hence, we suggest that future empirical work on the inequality-growth nexus should use more specific measures of inequality rather than measures of \u201coverall\u201d inequality such as the Gini index.",

Two separate measures of the dependent variable may be needed when analyzing the determinants of subjective well-being. We argue that this conclusion reflects in part the use of too restrictive econometric models. A flexible multiple-index ordered probit panel data model with varying thresholds can identify response asymmetries in single-item measures of subjective well-being. An application to data from the German Socio-Economic Panel for 1984-2004 shows that income has only a minor effect on positive subjective well-being but a large effect on negative well-being.",

The sample includes 1261 persons, with 636 men and 625 women. Data was analysed by multi-level mixed models and analysis of variance with repeated measures.\r\nResults: In the overall sample, there was no linear increase or decrease of work-life conflict detected, in either its time-based or strain-based form. People with higher education were more often found to have a strong work-life conflict (time- and strain-based), and more men demonstrated a strong time-based work-life conflict than women (12.2% vs. 5%). A negative relationship between work-life conflict and health satisfaction over time was found. People reporting strong work-life conflict at every wave reported lower health satisfaction than people with consistently weak work-life conflict. However, the health satisfaction of those with a continuously strong work-life conflict did not decrease during the study period.\r\nConclusions: Both time-based and strain-based work-life conflict are strongly correlated to health satisfaction. However, no evidence was found for a persistent work-life conflict leading to poor health satisfaction.",

The original view, which is still widely accepted, holds that the relationship is hump-shaped, with richness first rising and then declining with increasing productivity. Although recent meta-analyses questioned the generality of hump-shaped patterns, these syntheses have been criticized for failing to account for methodological differences among studies. We addressed such concerns by conducting standardized sampling in 48 herbaceous-dominated plant communities on five continents. We found no clear relationship between productivity and fine-scale (meters\u22122) richness within sites, within regions, or across the globe. Ecologists should focus on fresh, mechanistic approaches to understanding the multivariate links between productivity and richness.",

Tropical forest restoration can provide sub- stantial benefits for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and poverty alleviation. Yet the unpredictability of the synchronized flowering and consequent mass fruiting of many forest trees in Borneo presents a distinctive set of challenges for forest restoration. Significant financing and a considerable coordinated effort are required to prepare for future mass fruiting events if we are to capitalize on opportunities for ecological restoration. The continued high rate of forest clearance in this region and the rarity of mass fruiting events suggest that there may be few remaining opportunities to prevent widespread species extinctions. In this article we propose a facilitatory policy framework for forest restoration in Borneo to stimulate action in advance of the next mass fruiting of forest trees.",

While it justifies this engagement with its poverty reduction objective and its capacity to pave the way for new business activities in developing countries, critics blame the World Bank as a \u201cclimate profiteer\u201d and as an unfair competitor in private markets. Our econometric analysis of over 2,000 projects registered until May 2010 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol allows us to compare the activities of the Bank with those of other, primarily private actors. The results indicate that hardly any of the CDM projects can be considered as strongly pro-poor. Nevertheless, in comparison to the rest of the CDM projects, the Bank\u2019s portfolio shows a relatively clearer orientation towards poor countries. Within these countries, however, the Bank does not show any particular pro-poor focus, and tends to implement those projects that are commercially most attractive. Moreover, there is no evidence of the Bank phasing out its activities once the market becomes fully operational, which goes against its professed pioneering and catalytic role in carbon markets.",

In this environment, issuing government bonds facilitates saving for self-insurance. Despite this, we find that in a calibrated version of the model that is consistent with the skewed wealth and earnings distribution observable in the U.S., the government should buy private bonds, and not issue public debt in the long run. The reason is that in the U.S., a large fraction of the population has almost no wealth or is even in debt. The wealth-poor, however, do not profit from an increase in the interest rate following an increase in public debt. Instead, they gain from higher wages that result from a reduction in debt. We show that even when the short run costs of higher capital taxation are taken into account, it still pays off to reduce government debt on overall. Moreover, we find that endogenizing household\u2019s borrowing constraints by assuming limited commitment leads to even higher asset levels being optimal in the long run.",

In medulloblastoma, HLA class I molecules are associated with poor prognosis, and can induce ERK1/2 activation upon engagement with ligands that bind to incompletely assembled complexes (so called open conformers). We here demonstrate that ERK1/2 activation in medulloblastoma can occur in the absence of endogenously synthesized \u03b22m, formally excluding involvement of closed HLA class conformation. In addition, several experimental observations suggest that heterogeneity of HLA class I expression may be a reflection of the status of original cells before transformation, rather than a consequence of immune-based selection of HLA-loss mutants. These results contribute to our understanding of an immune system-independent role of HLA class I in the pathology of medulloblastoma, and cancer in general.",

This is the case for predominantly north-oriented shaded relief maps and geographic imagery in the northern hemisphere. The problem is a troubling one for distinguishing three-dimensional spatial relationships between the landforms, photo interpretation, and possibly for image classification tasks. Rotating the image or creating a negative of it seems to reverse the spatial relationships back to the intended representation, however these are poor solutions. The former discards the familiarity of the north-orientation and is prone to confuse the viewer, and latter modifies the color information in such a fundamental way that it is nearly impossible to tell the natural features apart. Currently there are only a few technical solutions that address this issue. With this paper, we contribute a range of techniques that explore the possibility of merging a perceptually-driven adjustment of a hill shading model with the orthoimagery to visualize the depth information in a perceptually correct manner.",

        "document": "Title: The impact of social status inconsistency on cardiovascular risk factors, myocardial infarction and stroke in the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Social inequalities in cardiovascular diseases are well documented. Yet, the relation of social status inconsistency (having different ranks in two or more status indicators like education, occupational position or income) and medical conditions of heart or vessels is not clear. Status inconsistency (SI) is assumed to be stressful, and the association of psychosocial distress and health is well known. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the relationship between cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and status inconsistency. Another target was to assess the influence of behaviour related risk factors on this association. METHODS: 8960 men and 6070 women, aged 45-65 years, from the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) were included. Socio-economic status was assessed by education/vocational training and occupational position at recruitment. During a median follow-up of 8.7 years, information on CVD was collected. RESULTS: Compared to status consistent subjects, men who were in a higher occupational position than could be expected given their educational attainment had a nearly two-fold increased incidence of CVD (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.5; 2.4, adjusted for age). Smoking behaviour and BMI differed significantly between those who had adequate occupational positions and those who did not. Yet, these lifestyle factors, as opposed to age, did not contribute to the observed differences in CVD. No association of cardiovascular diseases and status inconsistency was found for women or in cases where education exceeded occupational position. CONCLUSIONS: Status inconsistent men (occupational position > education) had a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases than status consistent men. However, harmful behaviour did not explain this relationship.",

We provide a possible theoretical explanation for these facts: a public health insurance system, fi nanced by taxes, can be an effi cient means of redistribution, complementary to income taxation. This relies on the assumption of a negative correlation between income and morbidity. We examine the empirical validity of this assumption on macro data.",

This is commonly interpreted as evidence for a tightening of borrowing constraints. This paper asks whether this is indeed the case. I present an incomplete-markets overlapping-generations model with college enrolment, in which altruistic parents provide transfers to their children. In the model the rise in earnings inequality observed between 1980 and 2000 acts as the driving force for generating the trends in the data. With the help of counterfactual experiments, I find that fraction of constrained households is much higher (24 instead of 8 percent) than indicated by the narrow enrolment gap in 1980. Contrary to what the development of the enrolment gap in the data suggests, the share of constrained households actually fell (to 18 percent) between 1980 and 2000. I show that altruism is important for explaining these findings.",

Identifying predictors of ART discontinuation is a priority in HIV care.\r\nMETHODS: A genetic association study in an observational cohort to evaluate the association of pharmacogenetic markers with time to treatment discontinuation during the first year of ART. Analysis included 577 treatment-naive individuals initiating tenofovir (n = 500) or abacavir (n = 77), with efavirenz (n = 272), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 184), or atazanavir/ritonavir (n = 121). Genotyping included 23 genetic markers in 15 genes associated with toxicity or pharmacokinetics of the study medication. Rates of ART discontinuation between groups with and without genetic risk markers were assessed by survival analysis using Cox regression models.\r\nRESULTS: During the first year of ART, 190 individuals (33%) stopped 1 or more drugs. For efavirenz and atazanavir, individuals with genetic risk markers experienced higher discontinuation rates than individuals without (71.15% vs 28.10%, and 62.5% vs 14.6%, respectively). The efavirenz discontinuation hazard ratio (HR) was 3.14 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-7.33, P = .008). The atazanavir discontinuation HR was 9.13 (95% CI: 3.38-24.69, P < .0001).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Several pharmacogenetic markers identify individuals at risk for early treatment discontinuation. These markers should be considered for validation in the clinical setting.",

Data on clinical behavior and optimal treatment strategies are scarce. We report on 11 consecutively treated children with centrally confirmed diagnosis of CNS ependymoblastoma, registered between February 1994 and October 2006 to the prospective GPOH-HIT multicenter brain tumor trials, and treated by multimodal regimens. Median age at diagnosis was 3.5 years (range, 1.8-5.6 years), and the median follow-up of survivors was 5.9 years (range, 2.2-12.7 years). Initial stage was M0 in 9, and M0/1 (no cerebrospinal fluid examination done) in 2 patients. Gross-total tumor resection was achieved in 7 patients, incomplete resection in 4 patients. Further primary therapy included chemotherapy in all patients, craniospinal radiotherapy in 5 patients and high-dose chemotherapy in 2 patients. Tumor response to chemotherapy was observed in 1 of 4 evaluable patients. Tumor progression occurred in 7 patients after a median time of 5.0 months (range, 2.5-19.2 months). Five-year progression-free survival was 36.4% (\u00b114.5%), 5-year overall survival 30.3% (\u00b115.9%). Of 4 survivors, 3 had gross-total tumor resection, and all were treated by either craniospinal radiotherapy and/or high-dose chemotherapy with autologous blood stem cell rescue. Prognosis of children with ependymoblastoma is poor, but sustained remissions have been achieved after multimodal treatment. Considerable diagnostic discrepancies between local and central pathologists underscore the importance of central review. Further studies are needed to improve survival of children with this rare malignant central nervous system tumor.",

In particular, the authors investigated educational problems during childhood, final educational achievement in adulthood, and its predictors. METHODS: Childhood cancer survivors who were aged <16 years at diagnosis from 1976 to 2003 who had survived for \u22655 years and were currently ages 20 to 40 years received a postal questionnaire during 2007 to 2009. Controls were respondents of the Swiss Health Survey ages 20 to 40 years. Educational achievement included compulsory schooling, vocational training, upper secondary schooling, and university degree. The analysis was weighted to optimize comparability of the populations. The authors analyzed the association between demographic and clinical predictors and educational achievement using multivariable logistic regression. Subgroup analyses focused on survivors aged \u226527 years. RESULTS: One-third of survivors encountered educational problems during schooling (30% repeated 1 year, and 35% received supportive tutoring). In the total sample, more survivors than controls achieved compulsory schooling only (8.7% vs 5.2%) and fewer acquired a university degree (7.3% vs 11%), but more survivors than controls achieved an upper secondary education (36.1 vs 24.1%). In those aged \u226527 years, differences in compulsory schooling and university education largely disappeared. In survivors and controls, sex, nationality, language region, and migration background were strong predictors of achievement. Survivors of central nervous system tumors or those who had a relapse had poorer outcomes (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors encountered problems during schooling and completed professional education with some delay. However, with the exception of patients who had central nervous system tumors and those who experienced a relapse, the final educational achievement in survivors of child cancer was comparable to that of the general population.

        "document": "Title: Aberrant DNA methylation characterizes juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia with poor outcome\nAbstract: Aberrant DNA methylation contributes to the malignant phenotype in virtually all types of cancer, including myeloid leukemia. We hypothesized that CpG island hypermethylation also occurs in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and investigated whether it is associated with clinical, hematologic, or prognostic features. Based on quantitative measurements of DNA methylation in 127 JMML cases using mass spectrometry (MassARRAY), we identified 4 gene CpG islands with frequent hypermethylation: BMP4 (36% of patients), CALCA (54%), CDKN2B (22%), and RARB (13%). Hypermethylation was significantly associated with poor prognosis: when the methylation data were transformed into prognostic scores using a LASSO Cox regression model, the 5-year overall survival was 0.41 for patients in the top tertile of scores versus 0.72 in the lowest score tertile (P = .002). Among patients given allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 0.52 in the highest versus 0.10 in the lowest score tertile (P = .007). In multivariate models, DNA methylation retained prognostic value independently of other clinical risk factors. Longitudinal analyses indicated that some cases acquired a more extensively methylated phenotype at relapse. In conclusion, our data suggest that a high-methylation phenotype characterizes an aggressive biologic variant of JMML and is an important molecular predictor of outcome.",

Our study aimed to determine whether motor impairments can occur despite early high-dose treatment. Sixty-three children with CH and early (median age of onset of treatment 9 d), high-dose treatment (median starting dose of levothyroxine 14.7 \u03bcg/kg/d) were tested with the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment (ZNA) at a median age of 13.8 y (range 7.0-14.2 y). Median z-scores in the children with CH were -0.95 in the pure and -0.56 in the adaptive fine motor component, significantly lower than in the ZNA test norms (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). The 26 children with athyreosis were more affected than the 33 children with dysgenesis, particularly in the pure motor (-1.55 versus -0.76, p = 0.03), adaptive fine motor (-1.31 versus 0.13, p < 0.01), and static balance task (-0.47 versus 0.67, p = 0.01). Boys performed worse than girls. Older age at onset of treatment was related to poorer adaptive fine motor performance. Movement quality (assessed by associated movements) was not affected. We conclude that severe CH can cause neuromotor deficits persisting into adolescence. These deficits cannot completely be reversed by postnatal treatment, but earlier age at treatment may reduce the degree of impairment.",

Poor outcome and health-care costs of nosocomial pneumonia remain a global burden. Currently, physicians rely on their experience to discriminate patients with good and poor outcome. However, standardized prognostic measures might guide medical decisions in the future. Pancreatic stone protein (PSP)/regenerating protein (reg) is associated with inflammation, infection, and other disease-related stimuli. The prognostic value of PSP/reg among critically ill patients is unknown. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate PSP/reg in VAP.\r\nMETHODS:\r\n\r\nOne hundred one patients with clinically diagnosed VAP were assessed. PSP/reg was retrospectively analyzed using deep-frozen serum samples from VAP onset up to day 7. The main end point was death within 28 days after VAP onset.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nSerum PSP/reg was associated with the sequential organ failure assessment score from VAP onset (Spearman rank correlation coefficient 0.49 P < .001) up to day 7. PSP/reg levels at VAP onset were elevated in nonsurvivors (n = 20) as compared with survivors (117.0 ng/mL [36.1-295.3] vs 36.3 ng/mL [21.0-124.0] P = .011). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of PSP/reg to predict mortality/survival were 0.69 at VAP onset and 0.76 at day 7. Two PSP/reg cutoffs potentially allow for identification of individuals with a particularly good and poor outcome. Whereas PSP/reg levels below 24 ng/mL at VAP onset were associated with a good chance of survival, levels above 177 ng/mL at day 7 were present in patients with a very poor outcome.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nSerum PSP/reg is a biomarker related to organ failure and outcome in patients with VAP.

The major problem for anyone trying to convincingly compare studies among centers or over time is the lack of a reliable staging system. The most commonly used system is the Bismuth-Corlette classification of bile duct involvement, which, however, does not include crucial information such as vascular encasement and distant metastases. Other systems are rarely used because they do not provide several key pieces of information guiding therapy. Therefore, we have designed a new system reporting the size of the tumor, the extent of the disease in the biliary system, the involvement of the hepatic artery and portal vein, the involvement of lymph nodes, distant metastases, and the volume of the putative remnant liver after resection. The aim of this system is the standardization of the reporting of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma so that relevant information regarding resectability, indications for liver transplantation, and prognosis can be provided. With this tool, we have created a new registry enabling every center to prospectively enter data on their patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (www.cholangioca.org). The availability of such standardized and multicenter data will enable us to identify the critical criteria guiding therapy.",

Biliary decompression was achieved by placement of two self-expanding metallic stents.\r\nDISCUSSION:\r\n\r\nIn presented patient, due to previous surgery percutaneous approach was mandatory. Also, considering the unresectability of recidivant lesion and poor prognosis, definitive, preferable internal biliary drainage was to be achieved. Therefore the placement of metallic self-expanding stent was the therapeutic method of choice.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThe aim of percutaneous minimally invasive radiological interventions is to achieve effective biliary decompression with internal bile drainage if possible.",

Consumers have nonhomothetic preferences over differentiated products of formal-sector goods and thus inequality affects the composition of aggregate demand via the price-setting behavior of firms. We find that high inequality divides the formal sector into mass producers and exclusive producers (which serve only the rich); high inequality generates an equilibrium where many workers are crowded into the informal economy; and an increase in subsistence productivity raises the unskilled workers' wages and boosts employment due to the higher purchasing power of poorer households.",

This forced large parts of the poorer classes into miserable living conditions. Lack of space, money and hygiene facilitated the epidemic spread of diseases such as tuberculosis and diarrhoea. The town authorities were called upon to stop speculation and to launch state financed housing projects. However, in reality the situation was very different depending on the place, political aims and financial possibilities arising out of the particular crisis. This article discusses the issue in two continental European cities of around 100,000 inhabitants. The Swiss town of Basel was a hub of trade in Central Europe, while Belgrade was the capital of the Southeastern European kingdom of Serbia.",

Intrahepatic inflammation is believed to mirror such activation, but its relationship with IL28B polymorphisms has yet to be fully appreciated. We analyzed the association of IL28B polymorphisms with histological and follow-up features in 2335 chronically HCV-infected Caucasian patients. Assessable phenotypes before any antiviral treatment included necroinflammatory activity (n = 1,098), fibrosis (n = 1,527), fibrosis progression rate (n = 1,312), and hepatocellular carcinoma development (n = 1,915). Associations of alleles with the phenotypes were evaluated by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression, accounting for all relevant covariates. The rare G allele at IL28B marker rs8099917-previously shown to be at risk of treatment failure-was associated with lower activity (P = 0.04), lower fibrosis (P = 0.02) with a trend toward lower fibrosis progression rate (P = 0.06). When stratified according to HCV genotype, most significant associations were observed in patients infected with non-1 genotypes (P = 0.003 for activity, P = 0.001 for fibrosis, and P = 0.02 for fibrosis progression rate), where the odds ratio of having necroinflammation or rapid fibrosis progression for patients with IL28B genotypes TG or GG versus TT were 0.48 (95% confidence intervals 0.30-0.78) and 0.56 (0.35-0.92), respectively. IL28B polymorphisms were not predictive of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: In chronic hepatitis C, IL28B variants associated with poor response to interferon therapy may predict slower fibrosis progression, especially in patients infected with non-1 HCV genotypes.

We wanted to test this novel device in pediatric plastic and reconstructive surgery.\r\nMATERIAL AND METHODS:\r\n\r\nBetween November 2004 and September 2009, we implanted 53 osmotic tissue expanders following standard surgical principles in a total of 30 children and adolescents with burn scars, congenital nevi, alopecia, or foot deformities.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nAll expanders reached their predicted volume within 6 weeks and 51 (96.2%) produced a sufficient amount of additional skin for the intended coverage of the defect. A serious infection precluding the planned reconstructive procedure occurred with 2 expanders (3.8%). Minor complications occurred at 6 implantation sites (11.4%), and consisted of small necrotic areas and perforations (n = 3) and minor infections (n = 3). These problems could be controlled and did not interfere with the subsequent plasty. The final results recorded at the last follow-up (mean: 21 months, range: 9-48 months) were rated as excellent in 25, good in 19, moderate in 6, and poor in 1 patient.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThis is apparently the largest pediatric series in which self-filling expanders have been used. The data obtained indicates that self-filling expanders can be safely and effectively used for various plastic, reconstructive and orthopedic procedures in children and adolescents. The fact that numerous painful and distressing filling sessions are obviated with these expanders is particularly beneficial for those children too young to understand and cooperate. Moreover, this approach minimizes the risk of infection and lowers costs.\r\n\r\n\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York.",

Methods:\u2002 Thirty-three children (85% of survivors) were examined at a mean age of 8.6\u2003years (3.3-15.7\u2003years), seven had a genetic comorbidity. Outcome was assessed with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence 3rd version and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale 4th version. Motor performance was tested with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2nd edition in children younger than 5\u2003years and thereafter with the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment. Results:\u2002 Children without a genetic comorbidity had a normal cognitive outcome (median IQ 103, 70-121), but fine motor (p\u2003=\u20030.008) and gross motor outcome (p\u2003=\u20030.001) were poorer than the norm. Medical variables were not predictive of adverse outcome, whereas genetic comorbidity was the strongest predictor of low IQ (p\u2003<\u20030.001) and of poor motor performance (p\u2003=\u20030.04). Conclusions:\u2002 In the absence of a genetic comorbidity, children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have a favourable cognitive outcome, but motor outcome may be affected. This needs to be taken into account for parental counselling. Further, long-term neurodevelopmental assessment in children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia is important to provide early therapeutic interventions.",

        "document": "Title: Abuse of dominance and its effects on economic development\nAbstract: Rules on abuse of dominance are used to find a balance between three objectives: 1) ensuring enough competition between firms in order to force them to be efficient and to compete on merit, 2) allowing a certain degree of profitability so that companies have incentives to become more efficient, and 3) achieving an equal distribution of wealth and business opportunities among different sectors of society. While the discussion in developed countries focuses on the first two aspects in order to maximize innovation and growth, developing countries may also want to consider the third dimension and include the reduction of inequality and poverty as objectives of abuse of dominance laws. But even the relationship between the first two aspects tends to vary among regions, because investment depends on factors that differ between developing and developed countries. These factors sometimes contradict each other and it is crucial to find a sound balance between them. Firstly, since developing economies often have smaller markets and, therefore, a lower equilibrium number of firms that can exploit economies of scale and operate efficiently, markets in developing countries are more likely to be concentrated. Furthermore, entry barriers tend to be higher and capital markets are often less developed, which causes obstacles for firms trying to compete with a dominant company. Secondly, large firms play a different role regarding their investment activity in developing countries than they do in more developed economies. Established firms can be important for less developed economies to have a sufficiently high level of investment in production. In such countries, the benefits of increased investments may outweigh efficiency losses that can arise from a more lax treatment of dominant firm conduct. Thirdly, distributional aspects may be especially important for developing countries. Smaller firms, which often represent poorer sectors of society, may have to be given better chances to compete against large dominant companies. Competition law can be used for such public interest issues, but it is crucial that the law gives clear guidance on how these objectives should be balanced against other objectives such as efficiency. The comparison of the EU and the US regarding abuse of dominance shows that significant differences exist even among developed countries. One reason for the disparity is differing assumptions about what types of conduct are harmful and how difficult it is to differentiate them from other conduct. The 'access to market principle' of the EU arises from the assumption that restrictions of market access are harmful to the economy and that a harmful conduct can be distinguished from other, not harmful, conduct. On the other hand, the 'non-intervention principle' of the US is based on the assumption that the distinction of such conduct is difficult, that there is great danger of prohibiting behaviour that is efficient and that the unnecessary prohibition of efficient conduct is severe. One conclusion from the comparison is that these assumptions should be analysed and be grounded on the economic reality. How likely and severe errors of competition authorities are can, for example, be assessed in an analysis of past decisions and their effects on the economy. Support of developing countries' competition authorities in analysing their own cases and the impact of their decisions on the economy would therefore be valuable.",

Clinical manifestations are varied and include hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), lymphoma and dysgammaglobulinemia, often triggered by Epstein-Barr virus infection. Historical data published before improved treatment regimens shows very poor outcome. We describe a large cohort of 91 genetically defined XLP1 patients collected from centers worldwide and report characteristics and outcome data for 43 patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and 48 untransplanted patients. The advent of better treatment strategies for HLH and malignancy has greatly reduced mortality for these patients, but HLH still remains the most severe feature of XLP1. Survival after allogeneic HSCT is 81.4% with good immune reconstitution in the large majority of patients and little evidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. However, survival falls to 50% in patients with HLH as a feature of disease. Untransplanted patients have an overall survival of 62.5% with the majority on immunoglobulin replacement therapy, but the outcome for those untransplanted after HLH is extremely poor (18.8%). HSCT should be undertaken in all patients with HLH, because outcome without transplant is extremely poor. The outcome of HSCT for other manifestations of XLP1 is very good, and if HSCT is not undertaken immediately, patients must be monitored closely for evidence of disease progression.",

Gradual and independent association between self-rated health and mortality persists over 30 years\nAbstract: Background:\r\nPoor self-rated health (SRH) is associated with increased mortality. However, most studies only adjust for few health risk factors and/or do not analyse whether this association is consistent also for intermediate categories of SRH and for follow-up periods exceeding 5\u201310 years. This study examined whether the SRH-mortality association remained significant 30 years after assessment when adjusting for a wide range of known clinical, behavioural and socio-demographic risk factors.\r\nMethods:\r\nWe followed-up 8,251 men and women aged \u226516 years who participated 1977\u201379 in a community based health study and were anonymously linked with the Swiss National Cohort (SNC) until the end of 2008. Covariates were measured at baseline and included education, marital status, smoking, medical history, medication, blood glucose and pressure.\r\nResults:\r\n92.8% of the original study participants could be linked to a census, mortality or emigration record of the SNC. Loss to follow-up 1980\u20132000 was 5.8%. Even after 30 years of follow-up and after adjustment for all covariates, the association between SRH and all-cause mortality remained strong and estimates almost linearly increased from \u201cexcellent\u201d (reference: hazard ratio, HR 1) to \u201cgood\u201d (men: HR 1.07 95% confidence interval 0.92\u20131.24, women: 1.22, 1.01\u20131.46) to \u201cfair\u201d (1.41, 1.18\u20131.68; 1.39, 1.14\u20131.70) to \u201cpoor\u201d(1.61, 1.15\u20132.25; 1.49, 1.07\u20132.06) to \u201cvery poor\u201d (2.85, 1.25\u20136.51; 1.30, 0.18\u20139.35).

The management of these patients is particularly difficult due to associated comorbidities. Hypertension, congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and coronary artery disease are often present in the elderly patient population, and therefore, antiarrhythmic drugs often fail due to side effects, proarrhythmia, or poor rhythm control. Recently, radiofrequency catheter ablation has been widely performed as an efficient therapy for recurrent, drug-refractory AF. Nevertheless, patients at old age were underrepresented in prior AF ablation trials, and the current guidelines for catheter ablation of AF recommend a noninvasive approach in the elderly patient group due to the lack of clinical data supporting ablation therapy. However, study results of our group and others are suggesting that catheter ablation is a safe and effective treatment for patients over the age of 65 years with symptomatic, drug-refractory AF, and therefore, patients should not be precluded from catheter ablation only on the basis of age. This paper discusses the pharmacological (rhythm control, rate control, and anticoagulation) and catheter management of AF in the elderly population.",

Whether certain electrocardiographic parameters are associated with a poor clinical outcome, however, remains elusive. The present study was therefore designed to comprehensively assess the predictive value of baseline ECG findings in patients newly diagnosed with IVNC.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\r\n\r\n74 patients diagnosed with IVNC were included in the analysis. During follow-up, 8 patients (11%) died of a cardiovascular cause or underwent heart transplantation (primary outcome measure). On univariate analysis, several variables, including repolarization abnormalities (ST segment elevation/depression, T-wave inversion) in the inferior leads (5-year estimator: 67.1 \u00b1 10.7% vs. 98 \u00b1 2.2%; P = 0.001), an increase in PQ- (hazard ratio (HR) 1.032, P=0.004) and QTc-duration (HR 1.037, P=0.001), were predictive of cardiovascular death or heart transplantation. On multivariate analysis, only PQ- and QTc-duration and the presence of repolarization abnormalities in the inferior leads remained significantly predictive of a poor outcome.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nPQ duration, QTc duration, and repolarization abnormalities in the inferior leads are independently predictive of a poor prognosis in IVNC. Further prospective studies are required to conclusively investigate the usefulness of baseline ECG parameters for risk stratification in patients with IVNC.",

Theoretically, she draws on the nonstate-led concept of 'inclusive social security' and links it with the anthropology of the house. In doing so she takes approaches of 'making' kinship, gender, age as well as citizenship into account. Care and respect for the elderly result from strong but gendered intergenerational kin relationships in and around the house, which they establish for a large part themselves. Governmental and civil provisions play an enabling or supplementary role. Elderly women, particularly widows, benefit from property relationships that are less gendered. Surprisingly, there is a remarkable tendency of creating house ownership, and thus of bargaining power, for women in this community. It is suggested that this is effected by a combination of Muslim inheritance rules, recent dowry-giving practices and Kerala's matrilineal history.",

        "document": "Title: Assessment of a medetomidin/propofol intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) for clinical anaesthesia in equidae\nAbstract: This study investigated the clinical use of a medetomidine/propofol TIVA technique in horses. Twenty-seven equidae of mixed breed, age [mean \u00b1\u200aSD (range)] 2.9 \u00b1 2.74 (0.11\u201311) years, weight (n = 15) 237 \u00b1 130.22 (64\u2013470) kg were anaesthetized for the following procedures: intra-abdominal (3); castration (15); joint flush (4); screw removal (1); desmotomy (3) and dermatoma removal (1). Horses were sedated with 7 \u00b5g kg\u22121 medetomidine IV and 10 minutes later anaesthesia was induced with 2 mg kg\u22121 propofol IV. Incremental doses of medetomidine were given prior to induction if the horse lifted its head when approached. Following induction, trachea were intubated and oxygen administered at FIO2 > 90%. Anaesthesia was maintained with 3.5 \u00b5g kg\u22121 h\u22121 medetomidine IV and propofol infused to effect (initial dose 0.1 mg kg\u22121min\u22121) 1. Heart rate, respiratory rate, propofol dose and arterial blood pressure were recorded every five minutes and arterial blood gases every 15 minutes. Quality of sedation, anaesthetic induction and recovery were evaluated by the first author according to previously described scores ( Bettschart-Wolfensberger et al. 1998). Data were analysed in a preliminary manner by descriptive statistical methods.\r\n\r\nTwelve horses required additional medetomidine for adequate sedation prior to induction (2 \u00b5g kg, n = 11; 6 \u00b5g kg, n = 1). Induction to anaesthesia was variable; excellent in 3, good in 18, fair in 4 and poor (unsatisfactory) in 2 horses. In an additional horse, induction to anaesthesia was very poor and transfer from the induction area to theatre was not possible, due to limb movement, even after several IV doses of propofol (total dose 2 mg kg\u22121) and thiopentone (total dose 2.5 mg kg\u22121). The use of propofol as an induction agent was stopped after this incident. During anaesthesia, range of mean values (absolute range) were, for respiratory rate 4.8\u201312.4 (4\u201332) min\u22121, heart rate 36.3\u201346.8 (15\u201358) min\u22121, mean arterial blood pressure 95.6\u2013111 (84\u2013128) mm Hg, propofol infusion 0.063\u20130.18 mg kg\u22121min\u22121, PaO2 23.2\u201331.8 (11.7\u201359.7) kPa, PaCO2 6.1\u20137 (5.2\u20138.5) kPa. Anaesthetic quality was excellent and spontaneous movement occurred in six horses but was slow and easily controlled with increments of propofol. Anaesthetic duration was 57.9 \u00b1 38.16 (15\u2013175) minutes. Recovery was completed unaided within 24.3 \u00b1 10.66 (10\u201344.8) minutes. It was uneventful in all horses.\r\n\r\nMedetomidine/propofol TIVA at the dose rates studied produced good quality anaesthesia with cardiopulmonary depression within ranges commonly recorded during inhalation anaesthesia in horses. However the quality of the anaesthetic induction was variable, and appeared inferior to that achieved with induction techniques which included ketamine.",

Lack of access to land, water, or education often leads to poverty. The present paper summarises research findings from an international research network, the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) North-South, regarding the crucial relation between such assets and access to them. It brings together insights obtained in studies around the globe as to why some people are excluded from access to assets. Beyond this, it raises the question of whether gaining access is sufficient \u2013 does access to resources in itself lead to benefits, or do we need to broaden the concept of access? In addressing these and other questions, this review of NCCR North-South research embeds the concepts of assets and access within a broader understanding of contested political processes, informed by contemporary social science debates. In the concluding section, this enhanced understanding of social realities is contrasted with social analyses underpinning (donor-supported) development interventions.",

Applying additive Bayesian network (ABN) modeling to data from the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLSM) survey reveals the\r\ncomplexity of child diarrhea as a disease system. The key distinction between standard analytical approaches, such as multivariable regression, and Bayesian network analyzes is that the latter attempts not only to identify statistically associated variables, but to additionally, and empirically, separate these into those directly and indirectly dependent with the outcome variable. Such discrimination is vastly more ambitious but has the potential to reveal far more about key features of complex disease systems. Additive Bayesian network analyzes across 41 variables from the PSLSM identified 182 direct dependencies, but with only\r\nthree variables: Access to a dry pit latrine (protective: OR=0.67); Access to an atypical water source (protective: OR=0.49); and No formal garbage collection (unprotective: OR=1.32), supported as directly dependent with the presence of diarrhea. All but two of the remaining variables were also in turn directly or indirectly dependent with these three key variables. These results are contrasted with the use of a standard approach (multivariable regression).",

We introduce non-homothetic preferences in a general-equilibrium model of endogenous growth and international trade between two countries, and argue that the effects of market integration on the consequent trade patterns and the incentives to innovate depend on the degree of income inequality across countries. We find that if inequality across countries is low, the extensive margin of trade between countries is high whereas the world growth rate is low. The introduction of non-homothetic preferences rises a number of interesting questions that are not an issue in the standard model. For example, we discuss the design of intellectual property rights, in particular national vs. international exhaustion of patents, and argue that households in poor and rich countries might not see eye to eye depending on how poor households weigh future losses in consumption against present gains. Furthermore, we address the welfare consequences of a trade liberalization, and show that households in the poor country might loose relative to households in the rich country if trade costs fall from a high to a sufficiently low level.",

Superficial radiotherapy (RTx)is an alternative treatment option, but long-term follow-up data are limited. Objective: To determine the outcome of superficial RTx of cSCC in correlation to histological differentiation grade and tumor localization. Methods: The outcome of 180 large cSCCs after superficial RTx between 1960 and 2004 was retrospectively reviewed. Results: Mean tumor size was 3.5 cm 2 (SD 7.5) and mean follow-up period was 4.9 years (SD 4.7). Relapse-free survival was 95.8 and 80.4% after 1 and 10 years. Two-year relapse-free survival was 94.8% for good, 88.9% for moderate and 85.7% for poor differentiated tumors. Five-year relapse-free survival was highest in cSCCs located around the eyes (100%) and cheeks (90.9%).

Methods: Differences in individual as well as dyadic (interpersonal) coping are examined in a sample of 39 clinically depressed patients and 21 former depressed persons living in a close relationship. Results: The results reveal that depressed patients differ significantly from remitted persons and controls in regard with both coping resources. Severely depressed patients not only cope individually in a less efficient manner, but also have a severe lack of dyadic coping resources, indicating that their coping capacities are generally reduced. As remitted patients did not differ from controls in their coping, our data support the notion that coping deficiencies are correlated with the maintenance of the depressive disorder and do not represent a stable personality trait. Conclusions. The findings highlight the importance of enhancing individual and dyadic coping skills in therapy of depressed patients in addition to other cognitive techniques.",

Our results reveal that African Americans are more likely to exhibit bulimic behavior than Whites; as are girls from low income families compared to middle and high income families. We use another data set to show that who is diagnosed with an eating disorder is in accord with popular beliefs, suggesting that African American and low-income girls are being under-diagnosed for BN. Our findings have important implications for public policy since they provide direction to policy makers regarding which adolescent females are most at risk for BN.

(Non-)violence, scarcity and resource access in Somali Region, Ethiopia\nAbstract: Scholars in the environmental security tradition have sought to explicate the links between environmental scarcity (or degradation) and the onset of different forms of political violence and how these are mediated by institutional mechanisms. The Malthusian trap here is not a direct deterministic relationship, but rather a possibility, where environmental scarcity when it coincides with socio-economic processes of rent-seeking and exclusion triggers political conditions ripe for violent struggles. This a priori attention to scarcity as causal mechanism blurs our understanding why violence occurs in some and does not in other places. Our research strategy is therefore different: we study a case of non-violent relations between resource users under conditions of environmental scarcity (due to drought) and political instability and look into the crucial role of local institutions in governing competing resource claims. Our case from the violence-prone Somali Region, Ethiopia analyses how agro-pastoralist communities develop sharing arrangements on pasture resources with intruding pastoralist communities in drought years, even though this places additional pressure on their grazing resource. A household survey investigates the determinants for different households in the agro-pastoralist community, asset- poor and wealthy ones, to enter into different types of sharing arrangements. Our findings suggest that resource sharing offers asset-poor households opportunities to stabilise and enhance their asset-base in drought years, providing incentives for cooperative rather than conflicting relations with intruding pastoralists.",

It began with the elective management of abdominal aortic aneurysm and has now found its way to the management of diseases of the thoracic aorta, as well as acute aortic pathologies like ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms, acute complicated aortic B-dissection and traumatic thoracic aortic rupture.

Our study is based on information gathered from a three-round survey of 149 rural households in three districts of Ethiopia during the 1999/2000 cropping season. The FGT poverty index (index proposed by Foster, Greer and Thorbecke) is employed to examine the extent and severity of rural poverty. It reveals that nearly 40% of the sample households live below poverty line with an average poverty gap of 0.047. The binary logit estimates shed light on factors behind the persistence of poverty and indicates that rural poverty is strongly linked to entitlement failures understood as lack of household resource endowments to crucial assets such as land, human capital and oxen. Our findings suggest that improved targeting devices can be a useful instrument in reducing poverty, in particular to reach the poorest of the poor.",

Study Design: Baseline data from a cohort study in sout hwest Germany including 1146 patients with T2DM recruited between October 2008 and March 2010 were used. Methods: After bivariate analyses, multivariate Poisson and logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of sex on the number of general practitioner (GP) and medical specialist appointments, prescribed medications, hospitalizations, and inpatient rehabilitations, with additional consideration of glycemic control levels. Poor glycemic control (PGC) was defined as glycated hemoglobin >7.5%. Results: In total, 905 participants had acceptable glycemic control and 237 participants had poor glycemic control. PGC was more prevalent in men than in women (23% vs 18%). Bivariate analyses among participants with PGC showed significantly fewer GP and medical specialist appointments, a lower number of medications, and longer rehabilitation stays in men than in women. Multivariate regression analyses among participants with PGC confirmed statistically significant gender differences for GP appointments and number of prescribed medications (P <.05) for men compared with women. Gender differences regarding inpatient care were less evident. Conclusions: Our data disclosed major gender differences in healthcare utilization of diabetes patients in Germany despite a high DMP-DM rate. Future research should focus attention on gender-specific approaches to healthcare delivery to improve quality and access to care.",

However, little is known about mutual influences between child and parental PTSS over time. This study prospectively examined the presence of PTSS and PTSD and the mutual influence of child and parental PTSS in a large sample of pediatric patients with different medical conditions.\r\nMETHODS:A total of 287 children (aged 6.5-16\u2003years) and their mothers (n\u2003=\u2003239) and fathers (n\u2003=\u2003221) were assessed at 5-6\u2003weeks and 1\u2003year after an accident or a new diagnosis of cancer or diabetes mellitus type 1 in the child.\r\nRESULTS:At the first assessment 11.1% and at the second assessment 10.2% of the children had moderate to severe PTSS. At 5-6\u2003weeks 29.3% of mothers and 18.6% of fathers met criteria for PTSD. At 1\u2003year the rates were 14.6% for mothers and 7.9% for fathers. There were considerable differences of PTSS among different medical diagnostic groups in children and parents. Mothers were more vulnerable than fathers. Structural equation analysis revealed that initially high PTSS in mothers and fathers were longitudinally related to poorer recovery from PTSS in the child. Cross-lagged effects from the child to the parents and from one parent to the other were not significant.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:This study highlights the long-term influence of parental PTSS on the child's recovery after trauma and calls for a family systems approach and for early interventions in the treatment of traumatized pediatric patients.",

Intelligence was assessed using the Raven's Progressive Matrices and neuromotor function using the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment. Risk factors were retrieved from detailed chart review.\r\nRESULTS: The mean intelligence score was 89 \u00b1 16, significantly lower than the norm (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 10% of patients. Poor neuromotor performance (less than p10) was present in 15% to 20% of the children, depending on the motor task (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Pure motor and static balance performance was also significantly impaired when patients with cerebral palsy were excluded (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Intelligence was only related to socioeconomic status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006), and neuromotor outcome was related to the length of hospital stay and postoperative neurologic abnormalities (P\u00a0<\u00a0.03). The extracorporeal circulation time was related to adaptive fine motor performance (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05). All other variables were not related to outcome.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Children without a genetic comorbidity are at risk of long-term intellectual and motor impairments also after full-flow cardiac repair. Surgery-related parameters play a less important role for adverse outcomes than postoperative complications. Our findings stress the importance of specialized follow-up assessments for all children with CHD undergoing open heart surgery.",

        "document": "Title: \"Placement budgets\" for supported employment - improving competitive employment for people with mental illness: study protocol of a multicentre randomized controlled trial\nAbstract: Background Vocational integration of people with mental illness is poor despite their willingness to work. The \u2018Individual Placement and Support\u2019 (IPS) model which emphasises rapid and direct job placement and continuing support to patient and employer has proven to be the most effective vocational intervention programme. Various studies have shown that every second patient with severe mental illness was able to find competitive employment within 18 months. However, the goal of taking up employment within two months was rarely achieved. Thus, we aim to test whether the new concept of limited placement budgets increases the effectiveness of IPS. Methods/Design Six job coaches in six out-patients psychiatric clinics in the Canton of Zurich support unemployed patients of their clinic who seek competitive employment. Between June 2010 and May 2011 patients (N=100) are randomly assigned to three different placement budgets of 25h, 40h, or 55h working hours of job coaches. Support lasts two years for those who find a job. The intervention ends for those who fail to find competitive employment when the respective placement budgets run out. The primary outcome measure is the time between study inclusion and first competitive employment that lasted three months or longer. Over a period of three years interviews are carried out every six months to measure changes in motivation, stigmatization, social network and social support, quality of life, job satisfaction, financial situation, and health conditions. Cognitive and social-cognitive tests are conducted at baseline to control for confounding variables. Discussion This study will show whether the effectiveness of IPS can be increased by the new concept of limited placement budgets. It will also be examined whether competitive employment leads in the long term to an improvement of mental illness, to a transfer of the psychiatric support system to private and vocational networks, to an increase in financial independence, to a reduction of perceived and internalized stigma, and to an increase in quality of life and job satisfaction of the patient. In addition, factors connected with fast competitive employment and holding that job down in the long term are being examined (motivation, stigmatization, social and financial situation).",

One hundred eighteen consecutively assessed patients were included. Pain and psychological health were recorded prior to and after the intervention, and at the 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up. The migrant group experienced a statistically significant and clinically relevant higher amount of pain and worse psychological functioning than the non-migrant group at all time points. Statistically significant differences between the groups for the variables depression, anxiety, kinesiophobia and passive coping, in particular catastrophizing, were observed in the short and long term. The non-migrant group improved continuously on all outcome measurements at all time points. The results show differences in outcome for chronic pain patients with and without migration background. High pain intensity, high levels of depression, anxiety and catastrophizing at baseline appear to be major barriers for improvement in a sample of migrant patients when participating in an IOPP. Treatments may have to be tailored to the specific needs of this patient group to better address their poor psychological health status and to improve the course of the pain disorder.",

        "document": "Title: Psychological adaptation to life-threatening injury in dyads: the role of dysfunctional disclosure of trauma\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Certain modes of trauma disclosure have been found to be associated with more severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS) in different trauma populations: the reluctance to disclose trauma-related thoughts and feelings, a strong urge to talk about it, and physical as well as emotional reactions during disclosure. Although social-contextual influences gain more and more interest in trauma research, no study has yet investigated these \u201cdysfunctional disclosure tendencies\u201d and their association with PTS from an interpersonal perspective.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: (1) To replicate previous findings on dysfunctional disclosure tendencies in patients with life-threatening injury and their significant others and (2) to study interpersonal associations between dysfunctional disclosure style and PTS at a dyadic level.\r\n\r\nMETHOD: PTS symptom severity and self-reports on dysfunctional disclosure tendencies were assessed in N=70 dyads comprising one individual with severe traumatic brain injury and a significant other (\"proxy\") 3 months after injury.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Regression analyses predicting PTS symptom severity revealed dysfunctional disclosure tendencies to have incremental validity above and beyond sex, age, and trauma severity within the individual (both patient and proxy), with moderate effect sizes. The interaction between patient's and proxy's disclosure style explained additional portions of the variance in patients' PTS symptom severity.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that dysfunctional disclosure tendencies are related to poorer psychological adaptation to severe traumatic brain injury. This intrapersonal association may be exacerbated by dysfunctional disclosure tendencies on the part of a significant other. Although the results require replication in other trauma samples without brain injury to further generalize the findings beyond the observed population, the study contributes to the expanding literature on the crucial role of interpersonal relationships in trauma recovery.",

Diagnostic criteria for complicated grief disorder. American Journal of Psychiatry 154, 904-910; Prigerson, H.G., Shear, M.K., Jacobs, S.C., Reynolds, C.F., Maciejewski, P.K., Davidson, J.R., Rosenheck, R., Pilkonis, P.A., Wortman, C.B., Williams, J.B., Widiger, T.A., Frank, E., Kupfer, D.J., Zisook, S., 1999. Consensus criteria for traumatic grief: a preliminary empirical test. British Journal of Psychiatry 174, 67-73]. There is also no data about prevalence rates of Complicated Grief in a representative sample. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic systems with regard to prevalence, conditional probabilities, and agreement.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: In a sample of elderly persons, features of bereavement, diagnoses of Complicated Grief and related symptoms were assessed. Agreement between the diagnostic systems was determined by kappa statistics.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: 18.9% of the sample had experienced a major bereavement, in average 15 years before measurement. The prevalence rates were 4.2% (Horowitz et al.) and 0.9% (Prigerson et al.). The agreement was poor (kappa=.13), i.e. the minority of cases received both diagnoses. The conditional probabilities of developing CG after experiencing a major bereavement were 22.2% (Horowitz et al.) and 4.6% (Prigerson et al.).\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS: The findings are constrained to an elderly, urban population. Screening instruments, no clinical interviews, were used to assess psychopathology.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The Horowitz et al. criteria set is more inclusive and less strict than the Prigerson et al. criteria set. The importance of functional impairment and the number of symptoms needed account for this difference. Further research should integrate diagnostic systems in order to achieve international standardization of diagnostic criteria for Complicated Grief.",

        "document": "Title: Ensuring land rights benefit the poor\nAbstract: Secure rights to property are vital for people to escape poverty. Such rights enable them, for example, to access and transfer land, borrow money using their house as collateral, graze their animals on common land, use water for irrigation, and collect fuelwood in forests. These rights are often formalised and guaranteed through state law.\r\nBut attempts to strengthen private- and common-property regimes have not always produced the expected results. Instead, local disputes often arise. This is because these rights are subject not only to government regulation, but also to customary norms and local power relations. Further, rights that are recognised by the government do not by themselves guarantee that people may use a piece of land in a productive way. Pro-poor property reforms must therefore be accompanied by efforts to strengthen legal security and local acceptance by considering customary practices as well. Support for land and labour productivity is also required, as the poor often lack the necessary means to benefit from land.",

In inexperienced hands this step can be time-consuming and exposes surgeons and patients to radiation. By means of a targeting device these potential drawbacks and dangers could be reduced. It was hypothesized that a specifically designed targeting device would reduce radiation exposure while improving screw placement when compared with the conventional \"free-hand'' method.\r\nMETHODS: Twenty matched-pairs of cadaveric hindfoot specimens (Thiel fixation) were prepared for the purpose of the study. The specimens were randomly assigned into two groups consisting of 10 specimens each: in Group 1 screw placement was performed with the targeting device and in Group 2 screw placement was performed under fluoroscopic control. Screw placement was radiographically judged to be optimal, suboptimal and poor. An experienced, fellowship-trained foot and ankle surgeon and a resident, who had never done subtalar fusions performed the screw placements. Exposure to radiation was assessed by means of the dose area product given by the fluoroscope.\r\nRESULTS: Optimal screw positioning was achieved in both groups in ten out of 20 specimens (Group 1, n=5; Group 2, n=5). Suboptimal screw placement was found in eight cases (Group 1, n=4; Group 2, n=4). There were two failures which occurred in fusions performed by the resident (Group 1, n=1; Group 2, n=1). Exposure to radiation was significantly reduced in Group 1 when compared with Group 2 (4.1cGy* cm2 versus 8.1cGy* cm2; p=0.012). No lesion of neurovascular structures due to aiming device placement occurred in Group 1.\r\nCONCLUSION: A target-device for screw-placement did not provide a significant technical advantage but did result in less radiation exposure.",

        "document": "Title: Nutrient acquisition from arable subsoils in temperate climates: A review\nAbstract: In arable farming systems, the term \u2018subsoil\u2019 refers to the soil beneath the tilled or formerly tilled soil horizon whereas the latter one is denoted as \u2018topsoil\u2019. To date, most agronomic and plant nutrition studies have widely neglected subsoil processes involved in nutrient acquisition by crop roots. Based on our current knowledge it can be assumed that subsoil properties such as comparatively high bulk density, low air permeability, and poverty of organic matter, nutrients and microbial biomass are obviously adverse for nutrient acquisition, and sometimes subsoils provide as little as less than 10% of annual nutrient uptake in fertilised arable fields. Nevertheless, there is also strong evidence indicating that subsoil can contribute to more than two-thirds of the plant nutrition of N, P and K, especially when the topsoil is dry or nutrient-depleted. Based on the existing literature, nutrient acquisition from arable subsoils may be conceptualised into three major process components: (I) mobilisation from the subsoil, (II) translocation to the shoot and long-term accumulation in the Ap horizon and (III) re-allocation to the subsoil. The quantitative estimation of nutrient acquisition from the subsoil requires the linking of field experiments with mathematical modelling approaches on different spatial scales including Process Based Models for the field scale and Functional\u2013Structural Plant Models for the plant scale. Possibilities to modify subsoil properties by means of agronomic management are limited, but \u2018subsoiling\u2019 \u2013 i.e. deep mechanical loosening \u2013 as well as the promotion of biopore formation are two potential strategies for increasing access to subsoil resources for crop roots in arable soils. The quantitative role of biopores in the nutrient acquisition from the subsoil is still unclear, and more research is needed to determine the bioaccessibility of nutrients in subsoil horizons.",

Discrepant findings have been reported regarding processing speed and attention, executive functions, and episodic memory. However, sleep quality has also been found to be related to cognitive performance in patients with depression. Our aim was to clarify the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive performance in healthy older adults, and to evaluate the moderating role of subclinical depression on this relationship. \r\n\r\nMethod: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess subjective sleep quality in 107 participants (age \u2265 61 years). A broad battery of neuropsychological tests measured basic cognitive processes, executive functions, and memory processes. \r\n\r\nResults: Subclinical depression moderated the link between sleep quality and cognitive performance. More precisely, poorer sleep quality was associated with lower performance in reasoning, semantic fluency, and shifting in those with high versus low levels of subclinical depression. \r\n\r\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that poor sleep quality might affect higher order cognitive processes, particularly in those reporting higher levels of subclinical depression. Findings on the relationships between sleep quality, cognitive functioning, and depressive symptomatology are discussed in relation to neurobehavioral theories of sleep.",

Worldwide, more than 600 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been treated with HSCT, most of them having been recruited in small, single-centre, phase 1-2 uncontrolled trials. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes from case series reports or Registry-based analyses suggest that a major response is achieved in most patients; quality and duration of response are better in patients transplanted during the relapsing-remitting phase than in those in the secondary progressive stage.\r\nOBJECTIVES: An interdisciplinary group of neurologists and haematologists has been formed, following two international meetings supported by the European and American Blood and Marrow Transplantation Societies, for the purpose of discussing a controlled clinical trial, to be designed within the new scenarios of evolving MS treatments.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Objectives of the trial, patient selection, transplant technology and outcome assessment were extensively discussed. The outcome of this process is summarized in the present paper, with the goal of establishing the background and advancing the development of a prospective, randomized, controlled multicentre trial to assess the clinical efficacy of HSCT for the treatment of highly active MS.",

Based on the review of the equity and cost-effectiveness literature and relevant policy documents, we identify three indicators for equity (vulnerability level, poverty, number of beneficiaries), and three indicators for cost-effectiveness (economic savings in absolute and relative terms, human lives saved). Applying these simple indicators to information provided in 16 project documents considered by the Adaptation Fund Board (AFB) in 2011, we find that projects approved by the AFB rank high according to one costeffectiveness indicator (absoluteeconomic savings), while they rather rank low according to all equity and further costeffectiveness indicators. Furthermore, we analyse whether \u2018equity\u2019 and \u2018cost-effectiveness\u2019 are two contradicting principles, or if ways can be found to reconcile both principles in multilateral adaptation finance. We conclude from both theory and the 16 analysed projects that a pure economic definition of cost-effectiveness is in contradiction with equity but tradeoffs between equity and cost-effectiveness can be limited if relative wealth savings, and other indicators, e.g. human health, are used as indicator for cost-effectiveness.",

Among all eligible patients, the rate of complete and partial responses (CR+PR) to HD-MTX-based chemotherapy was 44% in the elderly vs 57% in the younger patients (p = 0.016). Toxicity was age-independent except for a higher rate of grade III/IV leukopenia in the elderly (34% vs 21%, p = 0.007). Death on therapy was more frequent (18% vs 11%; p = 0.027), and progression-free survival (PFS) (4.0 vs 7.7 months, p = 0.014) and overall survival (12.5 vs 26.2 months, p < 0.001) inferior, in the elderly. A striking difference between younger and elderly patients was the PFS of CR patients of 35.0 in the younger vs 16.1 in the elderly patients (p = 0.024). Elderly patients were treated less often and less aggressively at salvage. However, age was not associated with survival from salvage whole brain radiotherapy in patients progressing during primary HD-MTX-based chemotherapy (p = 0.633).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Lower response rate and higher mortality on HD-MTX-based chemotherapy as well as lower PFS of CR patients and less salvage therapy contribute to the poor prognosis of elderly patients with PCNSL.",

        "document": "Title: Cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphomas, unspecified/NOS and rare subtypes: a heterogeneous group of challenging cutaneous lymphomas\nAbstract: Cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified/not otherwise specified (PTL NOS) represents a phenotypically and prognostically heterogenous group of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) that do not fit into any of well defined defined CTCL subtypes. In the WHO-EORTC classification as well as the WHO classification, three entities have been delineated as provisional rare subtypes of PTL based on their characteristic clinico-pathological, immunophenotypic and prognostic features and have been separated out from PTL, NOS: Primary cutaneous CD4-positive small/medium T-cell lymphoma (CD4+ SMTL), primary cutaneous CD8-positive aggressive epidermotropic T-cell lymphoma (CD8+ AECTCL), and primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma (CGD-TCL). CD4+ SMTL manifests in most patients with a solitary nodule in the head and neck area and nodular infiltrates of CD4+ small to medium-sized lymphocytes with nuclear pleomorphism. The prognosis of this lymphoproliferation is excellent in patients with a solitary lesion, but may be impaired in patients with multifocal disease. Rapidly evolving erosive or necrotic plaques and nodules with an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD8+ atypical lymphocytes are the hallmark of CD8+ AECTCL, which exhibits a poor prognosis. CGD-TCL displays a broad spectrum of clinical and histological manifestations with expression of the T-cell receptor gamma/delta chain as the common denominator and diagnostic marker. As most of other forms of PTL, CGD-TCL carries a poor prognosis. Despite the rarity of PTL NOS, clinicians as well as dermatopathologists and pathologists should be familiar with these rare CTC, especially since most of these lymphomas exhibit an unfavourable prognosis. Immediate intense treatment with multiagent chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is indicated in patients with PTL NOS. This review focuses on the clinicopathological aspects, the diagnostic criteria and the classification of the rare subtypes of PTL and PTL NOS.",

However, there is little evidence as to whether these associations are clearly present in pre-school children suffering from psychiatric disorders.\r\nMETHOD:\r\nA total of 30 pre-schoolers suffering from psychiatric disorders (anxiety, adjustment disorders, emotional and attachment disorder; hyperactivity or oppositional disorder) and 35 healthy controls took part in the study. Saliva cortisol secretion was assessed both at baseline and under challenge conditions. Sleep was assessed via activity monitoring for seven consecutive days and nights, using a digital movement-measuring instrument. Parents and teachers completed questionnaires assessing children's cognitive, emotional and social functioning. The Berkeley Puppet Interview provided child-based reports of cognitive-emotional processes.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nCompared to healthy controls, children suffering from psychiatric disorders had much higher cortisol secretion both at baseline and under challenge conditions. Sleep was also more disturbed, and parents and teachers rated children suffering from psychiatric disorders as cognitively, emotionally and behaviorally more impaired, relative to healthy controls. Children with psychiatric disorders reported being more bullied and victimized.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nIn five-year old children the presence of psychiatric disorders is reflected not only at psychological, social and behavioral, but also at neuroendocrine and sleep-related levels. It is likely that these children remain at increased risk for suffering from psychiatric difficulties later in life.",

Furthermore, rainfall-triggered floods and landslides notoriously and severely affect the region. For effective disaster prevention, a risk analysis is of primary importance. We present here a risk analysis methodology that is based on the assessment of lahar and rainfall-related flood hazard scenarios and different aspects of vulnerability. The methodology is applied for populated centres in the Combeima valley and the regional capital Ibague \u0301 (*500,000 inhabitants). Lahar scenarios of 0.5, 1, 5, and 15 million m3 volume are based on melting of 1, 2, 10, and 25 % of ice, firn and snow, respectively, due to volcanic activity and subsequent lahar formation. For flood modelling, design floods with a return period of 10 and 100 years were calculated. Vulnerability is assessed considering physical vulnerability, operationalized by market values of dwelling parcels and population density, whereas social vulnerability is expressed by the age structure of the population and poverty. Standardization of hazard and vulnerability allows for the integration into a risk equation, resulting in five-level risk maps, with additional quantitative estimate of damage. The probability of occurrence of lahars is low, but impacts would be disastrous, with about 20,000 people and more directly exposed to it. Floods are much more recurrent, but affected areas are generally smaller. High-risk zones in Ibague \u0301 are found in urban areas close to the main river with high social vulnerability. The methodology has proven to be a suitable tool to provide a first overview of spatial distribution of risk which is considered by local and regional authorities for disaster risk reduction. The harmonization of technical-engineering risk analysis and approaches from social sciences into common reference concepts should be further developed.",

However, some patients remain virologically suppressed despite suboptimal adherence. We hypothesized that this could result from host genetic factors influencing drug levels.\r\nMETHODS: Eligible individuals were Caucasians treated with efavirenz (EFV) and/or boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) with self-reported poor adherence, defined as missing doses of ART at least weekly for more than 6 months. Participants were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes previously reported to decrease EFV (rs3745274, rs35303484, rs35979566 in CYP2B6) and LPV/r clearance (rs4149056 in SLCO1B1, rs6945984 in CYP3A, rs717620 in ABCC2). Viral suppression was defined as having HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/ml throughout the study period.\r\nRESULTS: From January 2003 until May 2009, 37 individuals on EFV (28 suppressed and 9 not suppressed) and 69 on LPV/r (38 suppressed and 31 not suppressed) were eligible. The poor adherence period was a median of 32 weeks with 18.9% of EFV and 20.3% of LPV/r patients reporting missed doses on a daily basis. The tested SNPs were not determinant for viral suppression. Reporting missing >1 dose/week was associated with a lower probability of viral suppression compared to missing 1 dose/week (EFV: odds ratio (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.99; LPV/r: OR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09-0.94). In both groups, the probability of remaining suppressed increased with the duration of continuous suppression prior to the poor adherence period (EFV: OR 3.40, 95% CI: 0.62-18.75; LPV/r: OR 5.65, 95% CI: 1.82-17.56).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The investigated genetic variants did not play a significant role in the sustained viral suppression of individuals with suboptimal adherence. Risk of failure decreased with longer duration of viral suppression in this population.",

We studied whether physical examination could reliably measure or at least screen for gross anomalies of femoral torsion or if appropriate imaging should routinely be performed. Assessing femoral torsion of 45 volunteers using the \"trochanteric prominence angle test\" and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), inter- and intra-observer reliability ranged from poor to moderate and agreement with MRI values was only fair. Considering a 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 difference of femoral torsion as clinically relevant, physical examination failed to match MRI values within \u00b110\u00b0 in more than 50%. Arbitrarily defining thresholds for pathological femoral torsion, the \"trochanteric prominence angle test\" could not recognise torsions outside the >30\u00b0/<0\u00b0 range and diagnosed torsions outside the >20\u00b0/<10\u00b0 range with a sensitivity of 18%-75% and a specificity of 58%-98% only. Physical assessment of femoral torsion using the \"trochanteric prominence angle test\" does not allow reliable measurement or screening for gross anomalies. We therefore integrate an adapted MRI protocol allowing measurement of femoral torsion within our clinical work up.",

Tamoxifen efficacy is mediated by its biotransformation, predominantly via the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) isoenzyme, to the active metabolite endoxifen. We investigated the relationship of CYP2D6 genotypes to the metabolism of dextromethorphan (DM), which is frequently used as a surrogate marker for the formation of endoxifen. METHODS: The CYP2D6 genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in previously untreated patients with hormone receptor-positive invasive breast cancer considered to receive antihormonal therapy. The DM/dextrorphan (DX) urinary excretion ratios were obtained in a subset of patients by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mediated urine analysis after intake of 25 mg DM. The relationships of genotype and corresponding phenotype were statistically analyzed for association. RESULTS: From 151 patients predicted based on their genotype data for the 'traditional' CYP2D6 phenotype classes poor, intermediate, extensive and ultrarapid, 83 patients were examined for their DM/DX urinary ratios. The genotype-based poor metabolizer status correlated with the DM/DX ratios, whereas the intermediate, extensive and ultrarapid genotypes could not be distinguished based on their phenotype. Citalopram intake did not significantly influence the phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The DM metabolism can be reliably used to assess the CYP2D6 enzyme activity. The correlation with the genotype can be incomplete and the metabolic ratios do not seem to be compromised by citalopram. DM phenotyping may provide a standardized tool to better assess the CYP2D6 metabolic capacity.",

Results from a large community-based sample\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: There is evidence that positive personality characteristics, such as optimism and self-esteem, are important for health. Less is known about possible determinants of positive personality characteristics. PURPOSE: To test the relationship of optimism and self-esteem with insomnia symptoms and sleep duration. \r\n\r\nMETHOD: Sleep parameters, optimism, and self-esteem were assessed by self-report in a community-based sample of 1,805 adults aged between 30 and 84\u00a0years in the USA. Moderation of the relation between sleep and positive characteristics by gender and age as well as potential confounding of the association by depressive disorder was tested. \r\n\r\nRESULTS: Individuals with insomnia symptoms scored lower on optimism and self-esteem largely independent of age and sex, controlling for symptoms of depression and sleep duration. Short sleep duration (<6\u00a0h) was related to lower optimism and self-esteem when compared to individuals sleeping 7-8\u00a0h, controlling depressive symptoms. Long sleep duration (>9\u00a0h) was also related to low optimism and self-esteem independent of age and sex. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Good and sufficient sleep is associated with positive personality characteristics. This relationship is independent of the association between poor sleep and depression.",

The theoretical model predicts a positive impact of income inequality on product diversity. The impact of inequality on per-capita growth may be positive or negative depending upon the assumptions about productivity growth, where the standard assumption that productivity is positively related to product diversity implies a positive impact. In the empirical part, indices for absolute and relative product diversity are calculated from ICP-expenditure data. The empirical evidence shows that a significant positive relationship exists between income inequality and relative product diversity and that the relationship between income inequality and economic growth is negative and significant. The results lead to the conclusion that the diversity-productivity relationship used in new growth theory has to be treated with scepticism.",

        "document": "Title: Retirement of spouses and social security reform\nAbstract: The retirement decisions of spouses may be interdependent for various reasons: similarity of tastes, joint assets, sharing rules for income and housework, or complementarity of leisure. Because of data limitations, only a few empirical studies exist on this topic. From a policy point of view interdependent retirement could become important if legislators in different EC countries are forced to synchronize minimum retirement ages, which are lower now for females than males in a number of countries. In the theoretical part, the reaction of spouses to changes in the retirement age of their partners is analysed for typical family patterns. In the empirical part, the possibility of interdependent retirement is studied for Austrian data. The findings show an asymmetry: husbands react to changes in wives' legal minimum retirement age, wives don't react vice versa. The cross effect on men's participation rates -- resulting from a rise in women's minimum retirement age --is almost half as big as the first-round effect upon the women themselves.",

        "document": "Title: A population-based study on the patterns of use of different chemotherapy regimens in Swiss patients with early breast cancer\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: There is considerable heterogeneity in the use of chemotherapy in early breast cancer (BC), despite international recommendations issued from the NCCN, NIH and the St.Gallen bi-annual conference. METHODS: We included 1,535 patients from seven Swiss cancer registries between 2003 and 2005 receiving chemotherapy for stage I to III BC. Chemotherapy was categorised into (a) FAC/FEC, anthracyclines followed by CMF or anthracycline-taxane combinations (FAC-T) (781 patients) and (b) other chemotherapy regimens such as CMF/AC (EC) (754 patients). Predictors for choosing FAC-T over non-FAC-T chemotherapy were separately determined in all patients and in ER-negative patients (n = 496) by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The use of FAC-T increased significantly over time, from 44% in 2003 to 55% in 2005. BC stage III (versus stage\u00a0I-II) and nodal positivity were the predominant predictors for using FAC-T chemotherapy in the adjusted model (odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95%-confidence intervals (CI) 2.6-6.3 and OR 3.0, 95%-CI 2.0-4.4, respectively). In high-risk ER-negative BC patients, poor histological differentiation was more important to choose FAC-T chemotherapy (OR 3.8, 95%-CI 1.9-7.5) than tumour stage or nodal status. The use of FAC-T chemotherapy varied substantially among the seven geographic regions, from 20% in rural Grisons-Glarus to 73% in Zurich. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour biology is a predominant factor for choosing FAC-T over older chemotherapy regimens in patients with ER-negative early BC, but improvements should be made to reduce the substantial regional heterogeneity. Further epidemiological studies should assess how the use of FAC-T chemotherapy is affecting clinical outcome in patients with early BC and different risk profiles.",

        "document": "Title: Patients' perceptions of risky developments during psychotherapy\nAbstract: Research on risks and unwanted effects is largely missing in psychotherapy. Using exploratory factor analysis six dimensions of personal therapy situation were identified in a preliminary study, three of them were associated with risky developments during the psychotherapeutic process: (1) (poor) quality of therapeutic relationship, (2) burden caused by psychotherapy, and (3) dependency/isolation. Based on the finding of this study an online survey was performed to examine these three dimensions. Aside from these three factors another variable was associated with risky therapy developments: the online questionnaire also asked for premature terminations of psychotherapy as a consequence of risky conditions for the therapeutic development. Risky conditions were found to be associated with the following variables: (1) the combination of female patient\u2013male therapist, (2) the therapeutic orientation (particularly with the psychodynamic approaches) and (3) the duration of therapy. Fewer humanistic and systemic psychotherapies were found among the high risk-prone group of patients who were at risk in at least three of the four variables which were associated with risky developments. Differences in the findings of the study regarding the four therapeutic orientations stress the importance of an extensive differential indication and a cooperative partnership between patient and therapist, in order to facilitate a positive patient participation towards the choice of therapy method and subsequent successful participation throughout the course of treatment. Further studies should also focus on female patient and male therapist psychotherapies.",

Visual acuity of the treated study eyes, which received monthly intravitreal ranibizumab (0.3 mg or 0.5 mg), was compared between the 2 FE cohorts at the Month 6 and Month 12 visits.\r\nRESULTS:A total of 145 patients were analyzed. In the cohort with very poor FE visual acuity (n = 55), there were 35 patients in MARINA and 20 patients in ANCHOR; in the cohort with very good FE visual acuity (n = 90), there were 52 patients in MARINA and 38 patients in ANCHOR.The mean (standard deviation) gain of the study eye visual acuity in the very good FE cohort was 10.3 (13.3) and 10.8 (13.7) letters at Months 6 and 12, respectively, compared with a lesser mean visual acuity gain of 4.6 (12.2) and 6.7 (11.7) letters at Months 6 and 12 in the very poor vision FE cohort. There was no statistically significant difference (adjusted) in the study eye visual acuity change between the 2 cohorts at either 6 months (P = 0.11) or 12 months (P = 0.26).\r\nCONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis of the MARINA and ANCHOR study data did not support the hypothesis that FE visual acuity plays a significant role in driving visual acuity of patients receiving monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Visual acuity of the FE by itself is, therefore, not a useful parameter in predicting visual acuity in a majority of ranibizumab-treated patients.",

METHODS: Over 500.000 participants from several centers in ten European countries recruited between 1992 and 2000 were contacted 2-11 years later to update data on lifestyle and body weight. Length of follow-up as well as the method of approaching differed between the collaborating study centers. Non-responders were compared with responders using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Overall response for the second assessment was high (81.6%). Compared to postal surveys, centers where the participants completed the questionnaire by phone attained a higher response. Response was also high in centers with a short follow-up period. Non-response was higher in participants who were male (odds ratio 1.09 (confidence interval 1.07; 1.11), aged under 40 years (1.96 (1.90; 2.02), living alone (1.40 (1.37; 1.43), less educated (1.35 (1.12; 1.19), of poorer health (1.33 (1.27; 1.39), reporting an unhealthy lifestyle and who had either a low (<18.5 kg/m2, 1.16 (1.09; 1.23)) or a high BMI (>25, 1.08 (1.06; 1.10); especially \u226530 kg/m2, 1.26 (1.23; 1.29)).

        "document": "Title: Socioeconomic inequalities in mortality from conditions amenable to medical interventions: do they reflect inequalities in access or quality of health care?\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported large socioeconomic inequalities in mortality from conditions amenable to medical intervention, but it is unclear whether these can be attributed to inequalities in access or quality of health care, or to confounding influences such as inequalities in background risk of diseases. We therefore studied whether inequalities in mortality from conditions amenable to medical intervention vary between countries in patterns which differ from those observed for other (non-amenable) causes of death. More specifically, we hypothesized that, as compared to non-amenable causes, inequalities in mortality from amenable causes are more strongly associated with inequalities in health care use and less strongly with inequalities in common risk factors for disease such as smoking. METHODS: Cause-specific mortality data for people aged 30-74 years were obtained for 14 countries, and were analysed by calculating age-standardized mortality rates and relative risks comparing a lower with a higher educational group. Survey data on health care use and behavioural risk factors for people aged 30-74 years were obtained for 12 countries, and were analysed by calculating age-and sex-adjusted odds ratios comparing a low with a higher educational group. Patterns of association were explored by calculating correlation coefficients. RESULTS: In most countries and for most amenable causes of death substantial inequalities in mortality were observed, but inequalities in mortality from amenable causes did not vary between countries in patterns that are different from those seen for inequalities in non-amenable mortality. As compared to non-amenable causes, inequalities in mortality from amenable causes are not more strongly associated with inequalities in health care use. Inequalities in mortality from amenable causes are also not less strongly associated with common risk factors such as smoking. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence that inequalities in mortality from amenable conditions are related to inequalities in access or quality of health care. Further research is needed to find the causes of socio-economic inequalities in mortality from amenable conditions, and caution should be exercised in interpreting these inequalities as indicating health care deficiencies.",

METHODS: Fifty-five ELBW adults, 18 men (33%), with median (range) gestational age of 28.7 (25.0-34.0) weeks and birth weight of 930 (680-990) grams, born in Switzerland, were included. They self-rated their health status and mental health at a mean (range) age of 23.3 (21.8-25.9) years. Health status was measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 questionnaire and mental health by the Brief Symptom Inventory. RESULTS: The mean scores for both outcome measures were in the normal range. However, the study group self-rated significantly higher physical health status and lower mental health status compared with the community norms, and scores for self-perceived mental health tended to be worse in the former. ELBW adults reported more problems in socio-emotional role functioning compared with the community norms. Female sex was associated with poorer and bronchopulmonary dysplasia with better mental health status. CONCLUSION: Health status and mental health of former ELBW adults were overall satisfying. However, the comparison with the community norms revealed differences, which may be important for parental and patient counselling and developing support strategies.",

Coracoid transfer as described by Latarjet is a highly successful primary operation for recurrent anterior shoulder instability. The purpose of this study was to verify the hypothesis that this procedure is also effective for treating recurrent glenohumeral instability after previous operative repair.  METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients with either one (n = 32), two (n = 12), or at least three (n = 5) previous stabilizations other than a Latarjet procedure and recurrence of anterior glenohumeral instability associated with a lesion of the anterior aspect of the glenoid rim had revision with a coracoid transfer as described by Latarjet. Clinical outcomes at a mean of thirty-eight months postoperatively included the subjective shoulder value, the Constant-Murley score, and glenohumeral stability. Standardized anteroposterior and axial radiographs before and after the Latarjet revision were used to grade the degree of glenohumeral osteoarthritis.  RESULTS: The results in all forty-nine patients were reviewed. No shoulder redislocated, subluxations recurred in two patients, and five patients reported slight, unspecified shoulder symptoms. No revision surgery was needed. Forty-three shoulders (88%) were subjectively graded as excellent or good; three, fair; and three, poor. Dissatisfaction was associated with persistent pain, and patients with preoperative pain had a twentyfold higher probability of having postoperative pain. The mean subjective shoulder value increased from 53% preoperatively to 79% at the time of follow-up (p < 0.001), and the Constant-Murley score remained high (80% preoperatively and 85% at the time of follow-up; p = 0.061). Optimal graft placement was obtained in thirty cases and was related to better clinical outcome and less progression of osteoarthritis than was suboptimal graft placement.  CONCLUSIONS: Coracoid transfer as described by Latarjet can effectively restore anterior glenohumeral shoulder stability if previous operation(s) have failed to do so. If recurrence is associated with chronic pain, the pain is likely to persist and compromise the subjective outcome.",

METHODS: Of 178 prospectively enrolled patients with possible TB, 60 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary and 27 patients with extrapulmonary TB. The frequencies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells producing cytokines were assessed using overnight stimulation with purified protein derivate (PPD) or early secretory antigenic target (ESAT)-6, respectively.  RESULTS: Among patients with active TB, an increased type 1 cytokine profile consisting of mainly CD4(+) T cell derived interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 was detectable. Despite contributing to the cytokine profile as a whole, the independent diagnostic performance of one cytokine producing T cells as well as polyfunctional T cells was poor. IFN-\u03b3/Interleukin(IL)-2 cytokine ratios discriminated best between active TB and other diseases.  CONCLUSION: T cells producing one cytokine and polyfunctional T cells have a limited role in diagnosis of active TB. The significant shift from a \"memory type\" to an \"effector type\" cytokine profile may be useful for further development of a rapid immune-diagnostic tool for active TB.",

To assess the prognostic relevance of IKZF1 deletions for patients treated on Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group trial ALL-BFM 2000, we screened 694 diagnostic acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples by Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification. Patients whose leukemic cells beared IKZF1 deletions had a lower 5-year event-free survival (0.69+/-0.05 vs. 0.85+/-0.01; p<0.0001) compared to those without, mainly due to a higher cumulative incidence of relapses (0.21+/-0.04 vs. 0.10+/-0.01; p=0.001). Although IKZF1 deletions were significantly associated with the P2RY8-CRLF2 rearrangement, their prognostic value was found independent from this association. Thus, IKZF1 deletion is an independent predictor of treatment outcome and strong candidate marker for integration in future treatment stratification strategies on ALL-BFM protocols.",

Approximately one-third of these children can be cured. Their risk for late effects is high because of intensified treatment, but their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was largely unmeasured. Our aim was to compare HRQOL of ALL survivors with the general population, and of relapsed with non-relapsed ALL survivors.\r\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As part of the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (SCCSS) we sent a questionnaire to all ALL survivors in Switzerland who had been diagnosed between 1976-2003 at age <16 years, survived \u22655 years, and were currently aged \u226516 years. HRQOL was assessed with the Short Form-36 (SF-36), which measures four aspects of physical health and four aspects of mental health. A score of 50 corresponded to the mean of a healthy reference population. We analyzed data from 457 ALL survivors (response: 79%). Sixty-one survivors had suffered a relapse. Compared to the general population, ALL survivors reported similar or higher HRQOL scores on all scales. Survivors with a relapse scored lower in general health perceptions (51.6) compared to those without (55.8;p=0.005), but after adjusting for self-reported late effects, this difference disappeared.\r\nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to population norms, ALL survivors reported good HRQOL, even after a relapse. However, relapsed ALL survivors reported poorer general health than non-relapsed. Therefore, we encourage specialists to screen for poor general health in survivors after a relapse and, when appropriate, specifically seek and treat underlying late effects. This will help to improve patients' HRQOL.",

In nonmetastatic disease (n = 11), up to 5 postoperative cycles of HIT-SKK systemic multiagent chemotherapy (8 months duration), followed by craniospinal radiotherapy (CSI), were given. In metastatic disease (M1-M3, n = 6), treatment consisted of a shorter induction chemotherapy (2-3 months) with carboplatin and etoposide, followed by tandem high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) in case of good response to induction. During induction and HDCT, patients received intraventricular methotrexate. CSI was applied to all patients with poor response to induction or residual disease after HDCT and was optional for patients with residual disease before HDCT.ResultsFive-year event-free survival and overall survival rates \u00b1 standard error for all eligible patients were 24% \u00b1 10% and 40% \u00b1 12%, respectively (median follow-up of survivors: 8.3 years). Only one patient with nonmetastatic disease remained free of relapse/progressive disease during induction. Three of 6 patients with metastatic disease responded to induction and received tandem-HDCT, followed by preventive CSI, and remain in continuous complete remission.ConclusionsShort intensive induction chemotherapy followed by tandem-HDCT in young children with CNS-PNET/pineoblastomas seems to be superior to the prolonged and less intensive induction regimen.",

We expected recovery orientation and insight to be positively, and self-stigma to be negatively associated with a good therapeutic alliance. We expected these associations to be independent from age, clinical symptoms (i.e. positive and negative symptoms, depression), and more general aspects of relationship building like avoidant attachment style and the duration of treatment by the current therapist.\r\nMethods: The study included 156 participants with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in the maintenance phase of treatment. Therapeutic alliance, recovery orientation, self-stigma, insight, adult attachment style, and depression were assessed by self-report. Symptoms were rated by interviewers.\r\nResults: Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that more recovery orientation, less self-stigma, and more insight independently were associated with a better quality of the therapeutic alliance. Clinical symptoms, adult attachment style, age, and the duration of treatment by current therapist were unrelated to the quality of the therapeutic alliance.\r\nConclusion: Low recovery orientation and increased self-stigma might undermine the therapeutic alliance in schizophrenia beyond the detrimental effect of poor insight. Therefore in clinical settings, besides enhancing insight, recovery orientation, and self-stigma should be addressed.",

We used the online database PubMed in order to search for original published reports on PPI studies. The terms \u201cprepulse inhibition\u201d, \u201csensorimotor gating\u201d, \u201cblink recovery\u201d, and \u201cblink reflex excitability\u201d have been combined with the names of psychiatric disorders. We found that PPI is deficient in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS). In bipolar disorder dysfunctional PPI seems to be rather state dependent. Studies on depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) consistently report no alterations. Evidence regarding sensorimotor gating in anxiety, autism, fragile X syndrome, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance disorders, and Huntington's disease is still poor. There is a strong need for further studies on PPI in psychiatric disorders. PPI is highly applicable for translational research and might also be a very useful tool to investigate the mode of action of innovative, neuro-modulative techniques. Future PPI studies should control for influencing variables such as smoking, sex, or medication.",

Image quality was scored as poor (1), moderate (2), good (3), or excellent (4). Patients with BMI \u2265 45 kg/m(2) and nondiagnostic image quality (\u22642) were rescanned after repositioning to better center the heart in the field of view. Receiver-operating-curve analysis was applied to determine the BMI cutoff required to obtain diagnostic image quality (\u22653).\r\nRESULTS: Receiver-operating-curve analysis resulted in a cutoff BMI of 39 kg/m(2) (P < 0.001) for diagnostic image quality. In patients with BMI \u2265 40 kg/m(2), image quality was nondiagnostic in 81%; after CT-based attenuation correction this decreased to 55%. Repositioning further improved image quality. Rescanning on a conventional SPECT camera resulted in diagnostic image quality in all patients with BMI \u2265 45 kg/m(2).\r\nCONCLUSION: Patients with BMI \u2265 40 kg/m(2) should be scheduled for myocardial perfusion imaging on a conventional SPECT camera, as it is difficult to obtain diagnostic image quality on a cadmium-zinc-telluride camera.",

Therefore the CONSORT statement was introduced to improve the quality of reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCT). This study aimed to assess the quality of reporting of RCTs on pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder in relation to publication period and endorsement of publication guidelines.\r\nMethods: In the context of the development of the German evidence and consensus-based S3 guidelines for diagnosis and therapy of bipolar disorders a systematic literature search was carried out to identify all RCTs published between 2000 and 2010 relevant to the pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorders. An adapted checklist based on the CONSORT statement was used to assess the quality of reporting.\r\nResults: A total of 134 RCTs were included in this analysis. Of the 72 checklist items, 43% were generally reported adequately (reported in \u2009\u2265\u200975% of all trials) and 25% inadequately (reported in \u2009<\u200925% of all trials). Reporting was generally poor for randomization, effect size (reported in 22%) and number needed to treat (NNT 16%). No consistent trend could be shown for improvement in quality of reporting over time or for journals that do or do not endorse the URM (uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals).\r\nConclusions: Clinical investigators as well as editors and reviewers should be further encouraged to follow publication guidelines otherwise trials have to be downgraded or excluded from systematic evaluations.",

In the past decades, mental health care structures in Germany were successively transformed from long-term inpatient treatment capacities to decentralized outpatient and day clinic services. Currently, the proportional relation between treatment facilities in different settings has been stabilized and the strategy of mental health care development focuses on innovative and integrative models of care provision. The aim is to integrate fragmented services by the introduction of network structures to overcome rigid sector boundaries. The need for health care services is associated with multiple factors such as population-based epidemiological data, usage behavior, and health politics. Due to scarce data and poor standards of care it is difficult to determine if current structures of mental health services cover the actual needs. Therefore, a substantial increase of mental health service research is needed.",

Previous body-composition (BC) studies in children with CF used 2-component models (2CMs) to assess fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM), but to our knowledge no study has used the gold-standard 4-component model (4CM), which allows for a more accurate evaluation of the nature of both elements.\r\nOBJECTIVE: We measured BC by using the 4CM in 6-12-y-old children with CF to 1) compare findings with those of healthy, matched control children and reference data; 2) relate BC to lung spirometry [forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV\u2081)]; and 3) compare findings with those from more commonly used 2CM techniques.\r\nDESIGN: One hundred clinically stable children with CF (57% girls) aged 6-12 y were measured by using the 4CM. Children with CF underwent spirometry (FEV\u2081).\r\nRESULTS: Girls with CF had significantly less FM than did healthy girls, even after adjustment for height and pubertal status; boys with CF had higher body mass index SD scores than did healthy boys. FM in girls was positively associated with the FEV\u2081 percentage predicted. The 2CM FM was significantly different from the 4CM FM, with differences dependent on sex and condition, although most techniques identified a relation between FM and FEV\u2081 in girls.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Although shorter than healthy children, boys with CF were heavier and had a BC within the normal range; however, girls with CF had lower FM than did healthy girls, and this was associated with poorer lung function. Given the worse prognosis in girls, this finding merits more attention. The reliability of 2CM techniques varied with sex and health status.",

        "document": "Title: Validating and updating a risk model for pneumonia - a case study\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The development of risk prediction models is of increasing importance in medical research - their use in practice, however, is rare. Among other reasons this might be due to the fact that thorough validation is often lacking. This study focuses on two Bayesian approaches of how to validate a prediction rule for the diagnosis of pneumonia, and compares them with established validation methods.  METHODS: Expert knowledge was used to derive a risk prediction model for pneumonia. Data on more than 600 patients presenting with cough and fever at a general practitioner's practice in Switzerland were collected in order to validate the expert model and to examine the predictive performance of it. Additionally, four modifications of the original model including shrinkage of the regression coefficients, and two Bayesian approaches with the expert model used as prior mean and different weights for the prior covariance matrix were fitted. We quantify the predictive performance of the different methods with respect to calibration and discrimination, using cross-validation.  RESULTS: The predictive performance of the unshrinked regression coefficients was poor when applied to the Swiss cohort. Shrinkage improved the results, but a Bayesian model formulation with unspecified weight of the informative prior lead to large AUC and small Brier score, na\u00efve and after cross-validation. The advantage of this approach is the flexibility in case of a prior-data conflict.  CONCLUSIONS: Published risk prediction rules in clinical research need to be validated externally before they can be used in new settings. We propose to use a Bayesian model formulation with the original risk prediction rule as prior. The posterior means of the coefficients, given the validation data showed best predictive performance with respect to cross-validated calibration and discriminative ability.",

This article investigated how individuals in different regions of Germany, which are characterized by different economic opportunities, negotiate such demands to pursue a career. The central hypothesis is that under unfavorable economic conditions, disengagement from demands of career planning, in terms of reducing commitment to their mastery, will predict positive changes in subjective well-being. This was tested using a sample of N = 806 adults living in 91 regions of Germany. Results suggest that disengagement predicts increased subjective well-being, but only if individuals report a very high load of demands of career planning and live in regions characterized by particularly poor opportunities for goal striving. It is concluded that disengagement can be an adaptive way of mastering occupational planning under particularly disadvantageous circumstances.",

The objective of this study was to compare sexual activity and impairment rates of women with systemic sclerosis (SSc) to general population data and to identify domains of sexual function driving impairment in SSc.\r\nMETHODS: Canadian women with SSc were compared to women from a UK population sample. Sexual activity and, among sexually active women, sexual impairment were evaluated with a 9-item version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).\r\nRESULTS: Among women with SSc (mean age\u200a=\u200a57.0 years), 296 of 730 (41%) were sexually active, 181 (61%) of whom were sexually impaired, resulting in 115 of 730 (16%) who were sexually active without impairment. In the UK population sample (mean age\u200a=\u200a55.4 years), 956 of 1,498 women (64%) were sexually active, 420 (44%) of whom were impaired, with 536 of 1,498 (36%) sexually active without impairment. Adjusting for age and marital status, women with SSc were significantly less likely to be sexually active (OR\u200a=\u200a0.34, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a0.28-0.42) and, among sexually active women, significantly more likely to be sexually impaired (OR\u200a=\u200a1.88, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a1.42-2.49) than general population women. Controlling for total FSFI scores, women with SSc had significantly worse lubrication and pain scores than general population women.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Sexual functioning is a problem for many women with scleroderma and is associated with pain and poor lubrication. Evidence-based interventions to support sexual activity and function in women with SSc are needed.",

Strict dietary treatment decreases flexibility and autonomy and still has a major impact on patients and their families. Compliance is often poor, particularly in adolescence. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the intake of fruits and vegetables containing Phe less than 100 mg/100g ('simplified diet'), as recommended by WHO for all individuals, instead of classical totally restricted diet on the course and treatment control of the disease in a well-characterized PKU cohort (n=80). All individual blood Phe measurements of each patient (1992-2009) were statistically analyzed before and after diet switch. Epidemiological data, age at diagnosis, PAH mutations, BH(4) responsiveness, as well as Phe control measurements and detailed diet information were tabulated in a local database. 62.5% had BH4 loading test and 40% had PAH analysis; 50/80 switched from classical to simplified diet, including 26 classical PKU, 13 moderate PKU, 7 mild PKU and 4 mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Median Phe levels on a simplified diet did not differ significantly to the median Phe levels on classical diet in all disease groups. Our results indicate that a simplified diet has no negative effect on blood Phe control in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia, independent of severity of the phenotype or the age at diet switch, over the period of 3 years. Thus, a simpler approach to dietary treatment of PKU available to all HPA patients is more likely to be accepted and adhered by patients and might also increase quality of life.",

        "document": "Title: Place equality regimes in Swiss metropolitan areas\nAbstract: Due to a limited Welfare State, inequalities of income in Switzerland are comparatively high in European comparison. Moreover, these income inequalities have a very strong spatial dimension. Wealth and poverty concentrate in the major metropolitan areas of the county, displaying complex patterns of city-suburb disparities. As the proportions of people and activities in urban areas increase, metropolitan inequalities become a new challenge for the democratic Welfare State. Against this background, the paper examines place equality regimes in seven large metropolitan areas in Switzerland. First we assess spatial disparities within and across the metropolitan areas under scrutiny. Second we examine regional differences in government policies to address spatial and social inequalities, showing that fiscal equalisation as well as social policies are the two main vectors for such policies. Third, we examine place equality regimes across the seven metropolitan areas, focusing on the distribution of municipal revenues and expenditures within them. We find a strong correlation between inequality patterns in resident wealth on the one hand, and inequality patterns in municipal revenues and expenditures on the other hand. However, while core-cities seem to be provided with financial resources that are commensurate with high levels of social hardship, this is not the case for poor suburbs. In poor suburbs, the low share of redistributive expenditures in the municipal budget is striking. Our evidence suggest that this situation is linked to the political ecology of the metropolis, where right-wing political preferences in poor suburbs lead to limited social policy engagement by the municipal government.",

Patients present with hyperammonemia either shortly after birth (~50%) or, later at any age, leading to death or to severe neurological handicap in many survivors. Despite the existence of effective therapy with alternative pathway therapy and liver transplantation, outcomes remain poor. This may be related to underrecognition and delayed diagnosis due to the nonspecific clinical presentation and insufficient awareness of health care professionals because of disease rarity. These guidelines aim at providing a trans-European consensus to: guide practitioners, set standards of care and help awareness campaigns. To achieve these goals, the guidelines were developed using a Delphi methodology, by having professionals on UCDs across seven European countries to gather all the existing evidence, score it according to the SIGN evidence level system and draw a series of statements supported by an associated level of evidence. The guidelines were revised by external specialist consultants, unrelated authorities in the field of UCDs and practicing pediatricians in training. Although the evidence degree did hardly ever exceed level C (evidence from non-analytical studies like case reports and series), it was sufficient to guide practice on both acute and chronic presentations, address diagnosis, management, monitoring, outcomes, and psychosocial and ethical issues. Also, it identified knowledge voids that must be filled by future research. We believe these guidelines will help to: harmonise practice, set common standards and spread good practices with a positive impact on the outcomes of UCD patients.",

Representative current data on the severity of disability and of risk factors associated with poor outcome in this growing population are necessary for clinical guidance and parent counselling. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal multicentre cohort study of preterm infants born in Switzerland between 240/7 and 276/7 weeks gestational age during 2000-2008. Mortality, adverse outcome (death or severe ND) at two years, and predictors for poor outcome were analysed using multilevel multivariate logistic regression. Neurodevelopment was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development II. Cerebral palsy was graded after the Gross Motor Function Classification System. RESULTS: Of 1266 live born infants, 422 (33%) died. Follow-up information was available for 684 (81%) survivors: 440 (64%) showed favourable outcome, 166 (24%) moderate ND, and 78 (11%) severe ND. At birth, lower gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction and absence of antenatal corticosteroids were associated with mortality and adverse outcome (p\u2009<\u20090.001). At 360/7 weeks postmenstrual age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, major brain injury and retinopathy of prematurity were the main predictors for adverse outcome (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Survival without moderate or severe ND increased from 27% to 39% during the observation period (p\u2009=\u20090.02). CONCLUSIONS: In this recent Swiss national cohort study of extremely preterm infants, neonatal mortality was determined by gestational age, birth weight, and antenatal corticosteroids while neurodevelopmental outcome was determined by the major neonatal morbidities. We observed an increase of survival without moderate or severe disability.",

Compared to prednisone response, Day 15 marrow response was superior in outcome prediction in precursor B-cell and T-cell leukemia with, however, a differential effect depending on blast lineage. Outcome was poor in T-cell leukemia patients with prednisone poor-response independent of Day 15 marrow response, whereas among patients with prednisone good-response different risk groups could be identified by Day 15 marrow response. In contrast, prednisone response lost prognostic significance in precursor B-cell leukemia when stratified by Day 15 marrow response. Age and white blood cell count retained their independent prognostic effect.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Selective addition of Day 15 marrow response to conventional stratification criteria applied on ALL-BFM 95 (currently in use in several countries as regular chemotherapy protocol for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia) may significantly improve risk-adapted treatment delivery. Even though cutting-edge trial risk stratification is meanwhile dominated by minimal residual disease evaluation, an improved conventional risk assessment, as presented here, could be of great importance to countries that lack the technical and/or financial resources associated with the application of minimal residual disease analysis.",

Since data on patient aesthetic outcome after cranioplasty are rare in literature, we aimed to assess patient satisfaction after polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) cranioplasty in this study using a questionnaire.\r\nMETHODS: A patient questionnaire was developed to evaluate the grade of satisfaction after surgery. After approval by the institutional ethical review board, we were allowed to send to all 115 patients, who received a cranioplasty from 2001 to 2008 at the University Hospital of Zurich, our questionnaire once to retrospectively analyze the patient response together with the patient hospital records.\r\nRESULTS: Out of 115 patients, 36 patients were lost to follow-up and our questionnaire was sent out once to 79 patients. Sixty-three of 79 patients replied to the questionnaire (79\u00b77%) and 16 did not reply. Seventeen declined to participate in this study and out of the remaining 46 patients (58\u00b72%, 18 women, mean age 54 years, range 20-83 years), who agreed to participate in this study, 22 (47\u00b78%) judged their cranioplasty to be aesthetically 'excellent', 16 (34\u00b78%) 'favorable' and 4 (8\u00b77%) 'poor'. Another four patients (8\u00b77%) were not satisfied, asking for a surgical revision. Patient age and gender was not related to the assessment of the aesthetic result. A higher satisfaction grade was found in patients with primary PMMA cranioplasty compared to PMMA cranioplasty implanted during a second surgery (Fisher's exact test, P = 0\u00b7031). A dent was strongly associated with absence of satisfaction (P<0\u00b701, Fisher's exact test).\r\nCONCLUSION: Our questionnaire was suitable to assess patient satisfaction after cranioplasty. Localization of cranioplasty showed to be an important factor of aesthetic outcome, especially in the fronto-temporal region where a carefully planned reconstruction should be performed to guarantee an excellent grade of satisfaction after surgery.",

We prospectively compared the performance of these scores in elderly patients with VTE. METHODS: In a prospective multicenter Swiss cohort study, we studied 663 patients aged \u226565 years with acute VTE. The outcome was a first major bleeding at 90 days. We classified patients into three categories of bleeding risk (low, intermediate, and high) according to each score and dichotomized patients as high vs. low or intermediate risk. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, positive predictive values and likelihood ratios for each score. RESULTS: Overall, 28 out of 663 patients (4.2%, 95% confidence interval 2.8-6.0%) had a first major bleeding within 90 days. According to different scores, the rate of major bleeding varied from 1.9% to 2.1% in low-risk, from 4.2% to 5.0% in intermediate-risk, and from 3.1% to 6.6% in high-risk patients. The discriminative power of the scores was poor to moderate, with areas under the ROC curve ranging from 0.49 to 0.60 (P=0.21). The positive predictive values and positive likelihood ratios were low and varied from 3.1% to 6.6% and from 0.72 to 1.59, respectively. CONCLUSION: In elderly patients with VTE, existing bleeding risk scores do not have sufficient accuracy and power to discriminate between patients with VTE who are at high-risk of short-term major bleeding and those who are not. \u00a9 2012 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.",

Up to 50\u00a0% of all cases suffer from onset in childhood or adolescence, and the disorder often takes a chronic course with a poor long-term prognosis. Paediatric OCD, with its high familiality, is often referred to as a distinct OCD subtype that coincides with a developmental period in which the prefrontal cortex exhibits extensive structural and functional maturation. In the present review, we included all studies examining cognitive brain activation in children and/or adolescents with OCD. We conducted extensive literature searches for relevant articles (Pubmed, ScienceDirect) and summarize, tabulate, and discuss their results. For the eight activation studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we also performed preliminary meta-analyses to assess the most consistent hypo- and hyperactivation in paediatric OCD patients during cognitive task performance. The review of literature as well as our preliminary meta-analyses of paediatric studies indicated altered functional activation in the same brain regions of affective and cognitive cortico-striatal-thalamic (CST) circuits as for adult OCD patients despite some variations in the direction of activation difference. The still small number of studies that examined brain activation in paediatric OCD patients thereby largely converged with previous findings in adult patients and with the established neurobiological models of CST circuit dysfunction in OCD.",

METHODS: A systematic search of articles published in the English-language literature after 1980 identified a total of 21 studies, which included 716 patients who were either suffering from early onset schizophrenia (EOS) or both EOS and other psychotic disorders (MIX). The authors of the current review scored the outcome as either \"good,\" \"moderate,\" or \"poor.\" The mean age of onset in these studies was <18 years. RESULTS: In general, the outcome in studies with EOS is worse than the outcome in MIX studies. Only 15.4% of the patients in EOS studies versus 19.6% of the patients in MIX studies experienced a \"good\" outcome. In contrast, 24.5% of the patients in EOS studies versus 33.6% in MIX studies experienced a \"moderate\" outcome, and 60.1% in EOS studies versus 46.8% in MIX studies experienced a \"poor\" outcome. The authors identified various significant effects on outcome. In EOS, the findings were significantly affected by sample attrition, indicating that in studies with a high dropout rate, fewer patients experienced a \"moderate\" outcome, and more patients experienced a \"poor\" outcome; however, the effect sizes were small. Furthermore, the effects were also small and more favourable for specific functioning measures, as opposed to more global measures, small to moderate in terms of worse outcomes for follow-up periods >10 years, small to moderate for more unfavourable outcomes in males, and small to large for worse outcomes in studies including patients diagnosed before 1970. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the adult manifestation, the early manifestation of schizophrenia in childhood and adolescence still carries a particularly poor prognosis. According to these aggregated data analyses, longer follow-up periods, male sex, and patients having been diagnosed before 1970 contribute predominantly to the rather poor course of EOS.",

The idea that similarity of demand structures intensifies trade goes back to the well-known Linder hypothesis. Based on a sample of 102 countries, I find that bilateral trade volumes are increasing in the overlap of two countries income distributions. This effect is driven by both the extensive and intensive margin. I establish two novel measures of income similarity - the average income level of the overlap area and the range of incomes for which two distributions overlap - and document that both are important determinants of bilateral trade margins. My analysis shows that the positive relationship between similarity of income distributions and bilateral trade margins is present at the aggregate and disaggregate level of trade flows.",

The main objective of our retrospective study was to evaluate the role of VS as a marker of overall survival (OS) in patients treated with erlotinib and bevacizumab in the first line.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were pooled from two phase II trials (SAKK19/05 and NTR528). For survival analyses, a log-rank test was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between groups. The hazard ratio (HR) of any separation was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models.\r\nRESULTS: 117 patients were analyzed. VeriStrat classified patients into two groups which had a statistically significant difference in duration of OS (p = 0.0027, HR = 0.480, 95% confidence interval: 0.294-0.784).\r\nCONCLUSION: VeriStrat has a prognostic role in patients with advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC treated with erlotinib and bevacizumab in the first line. Further work is needed to study the predictive role of VeriStrat for erlotinib and bevacizumab in chemotherapy-untreated patients.",

A study in Pulpalli panchyat, Wayand district, Kerala\nAbstract: This paper examines the household livelihood strategies under agrarian distress in Pulpalli Panchayat of Kerala. It also looks at the relationship between household assets and livelihood strategies. The negotiations of institutions by the marginalized and depressed sections of the society were analysed in detail.\r\nMajor causes of agrarian distress in the study area are the ecological degradation and fall in crops income. Land continues to be the most important asset determining livelihood outcomes. The livelihood strategies have been investigated in relation to land, education, housing pattern, investments & credit facilities, and participation in organizational activities. The livelihood strategies adopted by farmers in the wake of agrarian crisis includes diversification of agriculture, share cropping, organic farming, self-help group activities, cattle rearing, migration and exchange of labour. Livelihood strategies varied across socio-economic groups as farmers owning better landholdings diversified cropping patterns while poor households participated in the activities of SHGs. Casual agricultural labourers and marginal farmers moved to other places in search of jobs. Mitigation of agrarian distress requires public provision of education, health and other social safety measures.",

Between 1991 and 2001 incidence rates of cystic echinococcosis (CE) increased by 4 fold or more. There also appeared to be increases in prevalence of CE in livestock and prevalences of Echinococcus granulosus reported in dogs. The increase in human echinococcosis was associated with changes in livestock husbandry, decline in veterinary public health services, increases in dog populations and increased poverty, all of which served to promote transmission of E. granulosus. A few years after reports of increased transmission of E. granulosus, the first reports of E. multilocularis infection in dogs were recorded. Further studies indicated that in both Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan prevalences of up to 18% were present. Recently there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cases of human alveolar echinococcosis recorded in Kyrgyzstan with over 60 cases reported in 2011.",

In patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage, the computed tomography angiography (CTA) spot sign predicts hematoma expansion and poor outcome. We conducted a 2-center prospective cohort study to evaluate whether CTA spot sign predicts case fatality in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraparenchymal extension.  METHODS: We studied consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraparenchymal extension. Two experienced readers, blinded to clinical data, analyzed CTAs for spot sign presence. We assessed the proportion of patients with the CTA spot sign and tested its association with in-hospital and 90-day case fatality, using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.  RESULTS: In 32 of 236 patients (14%), we found at least 1 spot sign. Acute surgical hematoma evacuation with aneurysm occlusion occurred in 120 patients (51%). The overall in-hospital case fatality rate was 37%. The CTA spot sign was not associated with in-hospital (multivariable odds ratio, 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.06-3.26]) or 90-day (multivariable odds ratio, 0.59 [0.21-1.65]) case fatality.  CONCLUSIONS: The found frequency of CTA spot signs is lower after aneurysmal than primary intracerebral hemorrhage and is not associated with in-hospital or 90-day case fatality in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraparenchymal extension.

PWUD are multimorbid patients who are difficult to integrate into existing healthcare systems. In our study, we evaluated the feasibility of providing HCV treatment within opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) programmes offering integrated primary care-based health services under one roof. METHODS: We evaluated 66 charts of patients in four outpatient clinics (OMT) with HCV treatment (between 2002 and 2010). Fourteen of the patients were treated with heroin and nine patients had an HIV coinfection. Data on the socioeconomic characteristics and quality of life were assessed. We counted the number of consultations in the clinic to assess how much supportive care the patients needed. RESULTS: Overall, 62% of all patients (41 out of 66) achieved a sustained virological response (SVR). A total of 84% of patients with genotype 3 achieved an SVR. Sixty-four percent of patients treated with heroin achieved an SVR. The majority of patients (71%) used illicit drugs during HCV treatment and over 80% were diagnosed with psychiatric comorbidities. Comparisons of patient characteristics according to SVR or non-SVR showed that a longer duration of OMT, more consultations per week during HCV treatment and poor self-reported physical condition were associated with non-SVR. CONCLUSION: We conclude that offering HCV treatment in an integrated primary care-based setting with OMT and individualized use of different supporting strategies allows for treatment success rates in the population of PWUD that is comparable to the ones in the population of patients without drug use. Heroin maintenance treatment programmes offer a feasible and safe setting for providing HCV treatment.",

Evolution of ontologies has to deal with vague or incomplete information. Accordingly, the formalism used for knowledge representation must be able to handle this kind of information. Classical logical approaches such as description logics are particularly poor in adressing uncertainty. Ontology evolution may benefit from exploring probabilistic or fuzzy approaches to knowledge representation. In this thesis an approach to evolve and update ontologies is developed which uses explicit and implicit user-input and extends probabilistic approaches to ontology engineering.",

Taking issue with this shortcoming in our contribution, we first replicate a survey of housing conditions in a rural district of Western Kenya dating back to 1980. Although we observe a significant improvement of housing structures over the past 25 years, we can also establish that deficient housing conditions fall disproportionately on the poor. Departing from this result, we secondly analyze an aided self-help housing scheme which aims to facilitate the improvement of housing conditions for the poor in rural areas of Kenya. Based on data gathered from 263 face-to-face interviews we examine the financial sustainability of the underlying mortgage system and aim to identify the main drivers of mortgage default through multivariate logit analysis. Our statistical results indicate that it is mainly endogenous variables like the size and the age of the program which drive mortgage default. At the same time, typical poverty variables are not significantly correlated with mal-performance in mortgage repayment and therefore increased targeting of poorer population groups is unlikely to result in declining repayment rates.",

It was developed for patients without trauma and inconsistently predicted mortality and adverse events in several previous studies of patients with trauma.  PURPOSE: We therefore (1) determined whether the three different CCIs were predictors for in-hospital deaths in patients with hip fractures, (2) verified if the CCI mortality prediction had changed with time, (3) evaluated other predictors of in-hospital death in patients with hip fractures, and (4) determined if the CCI has predicted in-hospital adverse events.  METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a nationwide probability sample survey, the National Hospital Discharge Survey. More than 6 million adult patients with hip fractures and their associated comorbidities were scored by the original 1987 CCI, the 1994 age-adjusted CCI, and the 2011 updated, reweighted CCI. The three mortality indices' predictive values and predictors of in-hospital adverse events were compared.  RESULTS: For patients with hip fractures, all three CCI variations predicted in-hospital mortality. The receiver operating curves (ROC) of the models were less than 0.68, but they improved when we used statistical models that included age, sex, concomitant injuries, and other comorbidities not contained in the CCI models (ROC > 0.74). The age-adjusted CCI accuracy was slightly better than the other two CCIs. Adverse events during hospital stays were associated with a higher CCI, pertrochanteric fracture (versus transcervical), abdominal, chest, or head trauma, atrial fibrillation, multiple fractures, female sex, and longer hospital stays; however, the accuracy of this model was poor (ROC = 0.65).  CONCLUSIONS: While all three CCI variations predicted in-hospital mortality in patients with hip fractures, other factors may be of value in patients with trauma.",

Searches were country-specific. To be included, studies had to report on the incidence of CT, on positivity to Toxoplasma-specific IgM in infants and pregnant women (including seroconversion results) or on positivity to Toxoplasma-specific IgG in the general population. Various modelling techniques were used, depending on the country-specific data available, to estimate the CT incidence and burden in each country. These data were then synthesized into an estimate of the global incidence of CT and of the global burden of CT in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).\r\nFindings The global annual incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis was estimated to be 190 100 cases (95% credible interval, CI: 179 300\u2013206 300). This was equivalent to a burden of 1.20 million DALYs (95% CI: 0.76\u20131.90). High burdens were seen in South America and in some Middle Eastern and low-income countries.\r\nConclusion Congenital toxoplasmosis poses a substantial burden of poor health globally. Toxoplasmosis should be included in future updates of the global burden of disease and the corresponding data should be used to support public health interventions to reduce disease burden.\r\na Section",

These organizations seek to achieve social missions through business ventures. Yet social missions and business ventures are associated with divergent goals, values, norms, and identities. Attending to them simultaneously creates tensions, competing demands, and ethical dilemmas. Effectively understanding social enterprises therefore depends on insight into the nature and management of these tensions. While existing research recognizes tensions between social missions and business ventures, we lack any systematic analysis. Our paper addresses this issue. We first categorize the types of tensions that arise between social missions and business ventures, emphasizing their prevalence and variety. We then explore how four different organizational theories offer insight into these tensions, and we develop an agenda for future research. We end by arguing that a focus on social-business tensions not only expands insight into social enterprises, but also provides an opportunity for research on social enterprises to inform traditional organizational theories. Taken together, our analysis of tensions in social enterprises integrates and seeks to energize research on this expanding phenomenon.",

Mean age was 8.7 years. Malignancy was found in 11 of 21 children (6 female, 15 male). Of these 21 children, 9 were cured, 8 are either in remission or their course is unknown, and 4 died. Eight of the nine cured patients were diagnosed as having had Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Of the four deceased children, three had a very short course (1 to 4 months) and were diagnosed with malignant lymphoma (n = 2) and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1). One patient died from a brain tumor other than the initially diagnosed T-cell lymphoma in the cavernous sinus after a follow-up of 8 years. MRI should be the preferred imaging technique\u2014even if it is not conclusive in many cases\u2014and every possible diagnostic effort should be made before using corticosteroids. No clinical or radiological signs other than rapid deterioration seem to be predictable of a malignant cavernous sinus lesion with poor outcome. Thus, close follow-up is recommended in children with signs and symptoms indicative of an acquired lesion in the cavernous sinus.",

Using the adult life span sample of the national German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP; N > 10,000, age range 18 to 96 years), we investigated age-differential stability, correlates, and outcomes of accuracy in anticipation of future life satisfaction across 6 subsequent 5-year time intervals. As expected, we observed few age differences in current life satisfaction but stronger age differences in future expectations: Younger adults anticipated improved future life satisfaction, overestimating their actual life satisfaction 5 years later. By contrast, older adults were more pessimistic about the future, generally underestimating their actual life satisfaction after 5 years. Such age differences persisted above and beyond the effects of self-rated health and income. Survival analyses revealed that, in later adulthood, underestimating one's life satisfaction 5 years later was related to lower hazard ratios for disability (n = 735 became disabled) and mortality (n = 879 died) across 10 or more years, even after controlling for age, sex, education, income, and self-rated health. Findings suggest that older adults are more likely to underestimate their life satisfaction in the future and that such underestimation was associated with positive health outcomes.",

Moreover, in multivariate happiness equations, these factors moderate the estimated effect of income on happiness, while no interaction effects are found for other socio-economic determinants of happiness.

DESIGN:  Retrospective case series. ANIMALS:  114 cats with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. PROCEDURES:  Data for analysis included history, signalment, physical examination findings, hematologic and serum biochemical data, presence of ketoacidosis, and diagnosis of concurrent diseases at initial evaluation. The effects of possible predictors on survival time were determined by calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS:  Median survival time of diabetic cats was 516 days (range, 1 to 3,468 days); 70%, 64%, and 46% lived longer than 3, 6, and 24 months, respectively. Survival time was significantly shorter for cats with higher creatinine concentrations, with a hazard of dying approximately 5% greater for each increase of 10 \u03bcg/dL in serum creatinine concentration (adjusted HR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.007). Ketoacidosis was not significantly associated with survival time (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.590 to 1.78). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:  Cats with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus had a fair to good prognosis. High serum creatinine concentration at diagnosis was associated with a poor outcome, likely because of the adverse effects of renal dysfunction. Ketoacidosis apparently was not associated with decreased survival time, suggesting that this complication should not necessarily be regarded as unfavorable.",

The goal of this study was to increase awareness of this disease by describing the clinical and laboratory findings in four young border collies with inherited cobalamin deficiency. The median age of the dogs was 11.5 mo (range, 8-42 mo), and two of the four dogs were full siblings. Clinical signs included intermittent lethargy (n = 4), poor body condition (n = 4), odynophagia (n = 2), glossitis (n = 1), and bradyarrhythmia (n = 1). Pertinent laboratory abnormalities were mild to moderate normocytic nonregenerative anemia (n = 3), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity (n = 3), and mild proteinuria (n = 3). All of the dogs had serum cobalamin levels below the detection limit of the assay, marked methylmalonic aciduria, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Full clinical recovery was achieved in all dogs with regular parenteral cobalamin supplementation, and laboratory abnormalities resolved, except the proteinuria and elevated AST activity persisted. This case series demonstrates the diverse clinical picture of primary cobalamin deficiency in border collies. Young border collies presenting with ambiguous clinical signs should be screened for cobalamin deficiency.",

This analysis revealed that GAS6 was highly expressed in ovarian cancer and therefore was selected as our candidate of choice. GAS6 encodes a secreted protein involved in physiological processes including cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and cell survival. We performed immunohistochemistry on various ovarian cancer tissues and found that GAS6 expression was elevated in tumour tissue samples compared to healthy control samples (P < 0.0001). In addition, GAS6 expression was also higher in tumours from patients with residual disease compared to those without. Our data propose GAS6 as an independent predictor of poor survival, suggesting GAS6, both on the mRNA and on the protein level, as a potential biomarker for ovarian cancer. In clinical practice, the staining of a tumour biopsy for GAS6 may be useful to assess cancer prognosis and/or to monitor disease progression.",

Yet, their recognition in clinical practice is often poor. This study evaluated the performance of three well known and internationally used dissociation scales in screening for dissociative disorders. Consecutively treated out- and day care-patients (n\u2009=\u2009160) from several psychiatric units in Switzerland completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ-20), and Multidimensional Inventory for Dissociation (MID). The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders-Revised (SCID-D-R) was then administered. Test performance of the scales was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves. The diagnostic accuracy, represented by the area under the curve, did not differ significantly between the three summary scales. Cut-off scores for detecting at least 80 % of any dissociative disorder and dissociative disorder-not-otherwise-specified/dissociative identity disorder, respectively, were 12 and 20 for the DES, 30 and 33 for the SDQ-20, and 28 and 28 for the MID summary scale. The diagnostic accuracy of the DES subscale \u2018absorption\u2019 and the MID subscale \u2018somatic symptoms\u2019 was equal or slightly lower than the corresponding summary scale. The DES, SDQ-20, and MID summary scales are suitable in screening for dissociative disorders in general psychiatric out- and day care-patients. Adequate cut-off scores in the German-adapted DES are lower than in non-German versions. Screening with the DES subscale \u2018absorption\u2019 and the MID subscale \u2018somatic symptoms\u2019 could be more efficient without the loss of diagnostic accuracy.",

Furthermore, determinants of HRQoL were examined.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\r\nIn a cross-sectional study, HRQoL of 45 men with corrected hypospadias (mean age: 26.2 years +/- 5.1) was compared with a control group of 46 circumcised men (mean age: 25.5 years +/- 4.9). Participants answered three questionnaires: The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 item questionnaire (SF-36), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and the Penile Perception Score (PPS).\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPhysical and mental dimensions of HRQoL were not impaired among men with corrected hypospadias if compared to circumcised men. Neither socio-demographic and medical variables nor erectile function (EF) predicted HRQoL. However, a negative genital self-perception (PPS) and a lower orgasmic function (OF) were risk factors for an impaired mental HRQoL.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nOur data suggest that the HRQoL of adult hypospadias patients is comparable to that of circumcised men. However, patients should be supported in developing a positive genital self-perception, because poor genital self-perception correlated with an impaired mental HRQoL. Since studies with non-operated men suggest that some adapt well to their penile condition, further studies should also include non-operated hypospadias.",

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. PATIENTS: Parents of 104 infants who had undergone cardiopulmonary bypass surgery before the age of 12 months for congenital heart disease were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. OUTCOME MEASURES: Parents completed the generic Impact on Family scale and a social support questionnaire; a large number of medical data were extracted from the patients' hospital records. RESULTS: Parents most frequently reported that they were thinking about not having more children and living on a \"roller coaster.\" No difference was found in the total Impact on Family scale score between fathers and mothers. The presence of a genetic disorder in the child and lower levels of perceived social support was significantly associated with a greater impact on the family. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of an infant's congenital heart disease on the family is determined both by child's medical condition and family's psychosocial factors. Families with poorer social support network may have the greatest need for professional interventions, especially if their child has an underlying genetic disorder.",

METHOD: Fifty-nine adolescents (34 females, 25 males) with CHD were examined at a median age of 13 years 8 months (range 11y 5mo-16y 11mo). Outcome was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, (fourth edition); the Beery Test of Visual-Motor Integration; the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test; the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment; the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; and the KIDSCREEN questionnaires. Results were compared with those of 40 age- and sex-matched healthy comparison individuals. RESULTS: Outcome with regard to full-scale IQ, perceptual reasoning, and the working memory scale was poorer in patients with CHD than in the comparison group (all p\u22640.001). Visual perception, visuomotor integration (p\u22640.001), and executive functions (Rey figure copy: p=0.05) were also affected. Patients with CHD also had lower scores on all motor domains (p<0.02) except static balance. Psychological adjustment was affected only in the 'peer relationship' domain (p=0.05). Quality of life was similar to that of typically developing peers. INTERPRETATION: Adolescents with CHD may manifest persistent cognitive and motor impairments, while psychological adjustment and self-reported HRQoL are mostly typical. Thus, long-term neurodevelopmental evaluations are necessary to provide early educational and therapeutic support.",

Because high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) reveals strong molecular similarities to TNBC, we aimed to investigate the potential link between ALDH1 and EGFR in this entity. Expression of ALDH1 was investigated in 131 primary HGSCs using immunohistochemistry. Expression data were correlated with EGFR expression as well as with clinicopathologic parameters and survival. Forty-two carcinomas (32.1%) were positive for ALDH1 protein expression. Data on EGFR expression were available for 112 tumors. In these cases ALDH1 was significantly linked to EGFR expression (P < .0001). ALDH1 positivity was a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival both in univariate (P = .010) and in multivariate survival analyses (P = .041). Tumors that were positive for both ALDH1 and EGFR had an exceptionally bad prognosis as compared with carcinomas with 1 or both markers negative in univariate analysis (P < .0001) and in the multivariate setting (P = .004). Our study suggests that similar to TNBC, there is a link between ALDH1 and EGFR expression in HGSC. Double positivity for both markers identifies a subgroup of highly aggressive, poor-prognosis cancers for which alternative treatment options-potentially EGFR-targeting drugs-should be evaluated.",

High HCV RNA levels have been associated with poor treatment response. This study aimed to examine the natural history of HCV RNA in chronically HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals.\r\nMETHODS: Mixed models were used to analyse the natural history of HCV RNA changes over time in HIV-positive patients with chronic HCV infection.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 1541 individuals, predominantly White (91%), male (73%), from southern (35%) and western central Europe (23%) and with HCV genotype 1 (58%), were included in the analysis.

Among patients not on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HCV RNA levels increased by a mean 27.6% per year [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.1-53.5%; P = 0.0098]. Among patients receiving cART, HCV RNA levels were stable, increasing by a mean 2.6% per year (95% CI -1.1 to 6.5%; P = 0.17).

The central variable determining the long-run rate of growth is personal income distribution. Its role in the process of growth depends crucially on the assumption about productivity growth. If productivity grows proportionally to product diversity, then an unequal distribution of incomes, measured by the rate of proportion of top to average incomes, has a positive effect on growth. However, under alternative assumptions, for instance, if productivity is a function of average income, inequality turns out to be harmful for economic growth.",

However, little empirical research has been undertaken to explore this hypothesis. The present study aims to study whether health literacy could be a pathway by which level of education affects health status. Health literacy was measured by the Health Activities and Literacy Scale, using data from a subsample of 5,136 adults between the ages of 25 and 65 years, gathered within the context of the 2007 Dutch Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey. Linear regression analyses were used in separate models to estimate the extent to which health literacy mediates educational disparities in self-reported general health, physical health status, and mental health status as measured by the Short Form-12. Health literacy was found to partially mediate the association between low education and low self-reported health status. As such, improving health literacy may be a useful strategy for reducing disparities in health related to education, as health literacy appears to play a role in explaining the underlying mechanism driving the relationship between low level of education and poor health.",

We evaluated the predictive value of adrenal function testing in acute ischemic stroke.  METHODS: In a cohort of 231 acute ischemic stroke patients, we measured dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA-Sulfate (DHEAS), cortisol at baseline and 30 minutes after stimulation with 1 ug ACTH. Delta cortisol, the amount of rise in the 1 ug ACTH-test, was calculated. Primary endpoint was poor functional outcome defined as modified Rankin scale 3-6 after 1 year. Secondary endpoint was nonsurvival after 1 year.  RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that DHEAS (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.49), but not DHEA (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99-1.04), was predictive for adverse functional outcome. Neither DHEA (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96-1.03) nor DHEAS (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82-1.44) were associated with mortality. Baseline and stimulated cortisol were predictive for mortality (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.20-1.71; 1.35, 95% CI 1.15-1.60), but only basal cortisol for functional outcome (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04-1.38). Delta cortisol was not predictive for functional outcome (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71-1.05) or mortality (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72-1.17). The ratios cortisol/DHEA and cortisol/DHEAS discriminated between favorable outcome and nonsurvival (both p<0.0001) and between unfavorable outcome and nonsurvival (p = 0.0071 and 0.0029), but are not independent predictors for functional outcome or mortality in multivariate analysis (adjusted OR for functional outcome for both 1.0 (95% CI 0.99-1.0), adjusted OR for mortality for both 1.0 (95% CI 0.99-1.0 and 1.0-1.01, respectively)).  CONCLUSION: DHEAS and the cortisol/DHEAS ratio predicts functional outcome 1 year after stroke whereas cortisol levels predict functional outcome and mortality.

        "document": "Title: Vitamin D supplementation in older adults: searching for specific guidelines in nursing homes\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency is very high in the nursing home (NH) population. Paradoxically, vitamin D insufficiency is rarely treated despite of strong clinical evidence and recommendations for supplementation. This review aims at reporting the current knowledge of vitamin D supplementation in NH and proposing recommendations adapted to the specificities of this institutional setting.\r\nDESIGN: Current literature on vitamin D supplementation for NH residents was narratively presented and discussed by the French Group of Geriatrics and Nutrition.\r\nRESULT: Vitamin D supplementation is a safe and well-tolerated treatment. Most residents in NH have vitamin D insufficiency, and would benefit from vitamin D supplement. However, only few residents are actually treated. Current specific and personalized protocols for vitamin D supplementation may not be practical for use in NH settings (e.g., assessment of serum vitamin D concentrations before and after supplementation). Therefore, our group proposes a model of intervention based on the systematic supplementation of vitamin D (1,000 IU/day) since the patient's admission to the NH and throughout his/her stay without the need of a preliminary evaluation of the baseline levels. Calcium should be prescribed only in case of poor dietary calcium intake.\r\nCONCLUSION: A population-based rather than individual-based approach may probably improve the management of vitamin D insufficiency in the older population living in NH, without increasing the risks of adverse health problems. The clinical relevance and cost effectiveness of this proposal should be assessed under NH real-world conditions to establish its feasibility.",

        "document": "Title: Perineal stapled prolapse resection for external rectal prolapse: is it worthwhile in the long-term?\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Perineal stapled prolapse (PSP) resection is a novel operation for treating external rectal prolapse. However, no long-term results have been reported in the literature. This study analyses the long-term recurrence rate, functional outcome, and morbidity associated with PSP resection.  METHODS: Nine consecutive patients undergoing PSP resection between 2007 and 2011 were prospectively followed. Surgery was performed by the same surgeons in a standardised technique. Recurrence rate, functional outcome, and complication grade were prospectively assessed.  RESULTS: All 9 patients undergoing PSP resection were investigated. The median age was 72 years (range 25-88 years). No intraoperative complications occurred. Faecal incontinence, preoperatively present in 2 patients, worsened postoperatively in one patient (Vaizey 18-22). One patient developed new-onset faecal incontinence (Vaizey 18). The median obstructive defecation syndrome score decreased postoperatively significantly from 11 (median; range 8-13) to 5 (median; range 4-8) (p < 0.005). At a median follow-up of 40 months (range 14-58 months), the prolapse recurrence rate was 44 % (4/9 patients).  CONCLUSIONS: The PSP resection is a fast and safe procedure associated with low morbidity. However, the poor long-term functional outcome and the recurrence rate of 44 % warrant a cautious patient selection.",

This study was conduced to evaluate current practice in the management of POPF after Whipple surgery and distal pancreatectomy (DP).\r\nMETHODS: An online survey endorsed by the European-African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (E-AHPBA) was conducted among surgical departments active in pancreatic surgery. A total of 108 centres were contacted by e-mail. The survey focused on the use and timing of drainage, nutrition strategies, provision of somatostatin and antibiotic therapies, imaging strategy and indications for reoperation when POPF is diagnosed after pancreatic surgery.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 55 centres (51%) completed the survey. Overall, responses showed poor agreement among centres (Fleiss' kappa: <0.40) on 89% of items after Whipple surgery and 78% of items after DP. There was very poor or no agreement (Fleiss' kappa: <0.1) on postoperative strategies for the management of nutrition and use of somatostatin after both procedures. In the event of POPF, 42% of centres used total oral nutrition and 22% used somatostatin after Whipple surgery, and 71% used total oral nutrition and 31% used somatostatin after DP. There were significant disagreements between units conducting, respectively, more and fewer than 50 Whipple procedures per year on drain removal after DP, and imaging strategy and patient discharge after Whipple surgery and DP.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: This survey discloses important disagreements worldwide regarding the management of POPF after both Whipple surgery and DP. The standardized management of POPF would better facilitate the comparison of outcomes in future trials.",

        "document": "Title: Sex determination from the foramen magnum\nAbstract: This paper presents the findings of a study to investigate the value of measurements of the foramen magnum in relation to the determination of biological sex. The study performed a large-scale analysis of 250 adult individuals (male=144, female=106) from a modern Swiss population utilising CT data acquired in the context of the Virtopsy\u00ae Project. Data was analysed using discriminant function and binary logistic regression techniques and visual observations of the morphology of the foramen magnum were made to contextualise the findings. The study found that with all variables, males and females were equally classified at 66 accuracy by discriminant function analysis, where binary logistic regression was comparatively poor at classifying females despite an overall classification rate of 66.4. The morphology of the foramen magnum was classified in 88 of the sample by visual assessment according to seven shape types; however 12 of the sample was unclassified due to shape irregularities arising from asymmetry and rim complexities. This study concludes that while measurements of the foramen magnum appear to demonstrate statistically significant differences between the sexes, the ability to discriminate sex may be limited by morphological variation. This may also influence the accuracy to which sex can be determined in individual crania and thus the isolated use of this method is not advisable unless as a suggestive finding when other features of assessment are absent or limited. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The identification of subgroups of young people with a high prevalence of one or more of these risk factors allows an optimised allocation of preventive measures. This study aimed at investigating hazardous drinking, tobacco smoking and physical inactivity as well as their associations and demographic predictors in vocational school students. Methods: Out of 57 contacted vocational schools in Switzerland, a total of 24 schools participated in a survey assessing gender, age, immigrant background, educational attainment and vocational field as well as the above mentioned health risk factors. Out of the 2659 students present in 177 included vocational school classes, 2647 (99.5%) completed the survey. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the demographic predictors of each health risk factor and a multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate predictors of different risk factor combinations. Results: Of the surveyed students, 79.4% showed at least one risk factor, 43.6% showed two or more and 9.6% showed all three health risk factors. Hazardous drinking was more prevalent in male, physical inactivity was more prevalent in female vocational school students. The proportion of students with low physical activity and tobacco smoking increased with increasing age. While the combination of hazardous drinking and tobacco smoking was higher in males, the other risk factor combinations were observed particularly among females. Conclusions: Multiple risk factors were ascertained in a significant proportion of vocational school students. Specifically, tobacco smoking and hazardous drinking were coexistent. The study underlines the need for preventive measures in specific subpopulations of adolescents and young adults with lower educational level.",

No stratification criteria have been established so far. Recently, activating NOTCH1 mutations were reported to be associated with favorable prognosis, and loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 6q (LOH6q) was reported to be associated with increased relapse risk. The current project was intended to evaluate the prognostic effect of these markers. Mutations in hot spots of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 were analyzed in 116 patients. Concerning LOH6q status, 118 patients were investigated, using microsatellite marker analysis, in addition to an earlier reported cohort of 99 available patients. Ninety-two cases were evaluable for both analyses. All patients were treated with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma-Berlin-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster group (BFM)-type treatment. LOH6q was observed in 12% of patients (25/217) and associated with unfavorable prognosis (pEFS 27% \u00b1 9% vs 86% \u00b1 3%; P < .0001). In 60% (70/116) of the patients, NOTCH1 mutations were detected and associated with favorable prognosis (pEFS 84% \u00b1 5% vs 66% \u00b1 7%; P = .021). Interestingly, NOTCH1 mutations were rarely observed in patients with LOH in 6q16. Both prognostic markers will be used as stratification criteria in coming Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma-BFM trials.",

In the trial ALL-BFM 95, early cytomorphological marrow response on day 15 of induction therapy was prospectively evaluated and its prognostic value was analyzed in comparison to the prednisone response and other established prognostic factors.\r\nRESULTS: Compared to prednisone response, day 15 marrow response was superior in outcome prediction - yet with differential effect depending on blast lineage. Outcome was poor in T cell leukemia patients with prednisone poor-response independent of day 15 marrow response, whereas among patients with prednisone good-response different risk groups could be identified by day 15 marrow response. In contrast, prednisone response lost prognostic significance in precursor B cell leukemia when stratified by day 15 marrow response.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Selective addition of day 15 marrow response to conventional stratification criteria applied on ALL-BFM 95 may significantly improve risk-adapted treatment delivery. Even though cutting-edge trial risk stratification is meanwhile dominated by minimal residual disease evaluation, an improved conventional risk assessment, as presented here, could be of great importance to countries lacking the technical and/or financial resources associated with the application of minimal residual disease analysis.",

        "document": "Title: Print-specific multimodal brain activation in kindergarten improves prediction of reading skills in second grade\nAbstract: Children who are poor readers usually experience troublesome school careers and consequently often suffer from secondary emotional and behavioural problems. Early identification and prediction of later reading problems thus are critical in order to start targeted interventions for those children with an elevated risk for emerging reading problems. In this study, behavioural precursors of reading were assessed in nineteen (aged 6.4 \u00b1 0.3 years) non-reading kindergarteners before training letter-speech sound associations with a computerized game (Graphogame) for eight weeks. The training aimed to introduce the basic principles of letter-speech sound correspondences and to initialize the sensitization of specific brain areas to print. Event-related potentials (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were recorded during an explicit word/symbol processing task after the training. Reading skills were assessed two years later in second grade. The focus of this study was on clarifying whether electrophysiological and fMRI data of kindergarten children significantly improve prediction of future reading skills in 2nd grade over behavioural data alone. Based on evidence from previous studies demonstrating the importance of initial print sensitivity in the left occipito-temporal visual word form system (VWFS) for learning to read, the first pronounced difference in processing words compared to symbols in the ERP, an occipito-temporal negativity (N1: 188-281 ms) along with the corresponding functional activation in the left occipito-temporal VWFS were defined as potential predictors. ERP and fMRI data in kindergarteners significantly improved the prediction of reading skills in 2nd grade over behavioural data alone. Together with the behavioural measures they explained up to 88% of the variance. An additional discriminant analysis revealed a remarkably high accuracy in classifying normal (n=11) and poor readers (n=6). Due to the key limitation of the study, i.e. the small group sizes, the results of our prediction analyses should be interpreted with caution and regarded as preliminary despite cross-validation. Nevertheless our results indicate the potential of combining neuroimaging and behavioural measures to improve prediction at an early stage, when literacy skills are acquired and interventions are most beneficial.",

However, what is the role of ethical theories in this context? This question will be examined in this article by analysing the contribution made by the ethics of care, in particular in understandings of gender roles, asymmetries of power, professional knowledge and experience. The adoption and criticism of an emergent nursing ethics is discussed and stated from different viewpoints. The actuality of the caring approach is affirmed by a new reading of the given situation. This article first describes the traditional perception of nurses as marginalised actors in the health sector. By making reference to the current and growing global scarcity of nursing care, it contends that nursing will no longer be marginalised, but instead at the centre of public health attention and reputation. Nevertheless, marginalisation will persist by increasingly affecting the care receivers, especially those groups that are pushed to the fringes by the consequences of the healthcare market, such as persons of extreme old age, suffering from multiple morbidities, or with poor health literacy. Whereas the \"classical\" understanding of the ethics of care focuses on the nurse-patient relationship and on individual care and understanding of ethics, the new understanding confirms the classical, but adds an understanding of social ethics: caring for the access to care is seen as a main ethical goal of social justice within a nursing ethic.",

Many smart solutions are today designed in a \u201cGreen IT\u201d context and proposed with the intention to contribute to environmental or social sustainability. Such claims include, for example, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saving energy, finding the most sustainable alternative in a decision situation, optimising a process with regard to sustainability criteria, or enabling participation and reducing poverty. However, it is difficult to determine whether the potential net benefit of the smart solution will materialize under real-world conditions, in particular when considering the dynamics of markets, possible rebound effects and other systemic effects. \"Smarter\" does not necessarily imply \"more sustainable\". The First International Conference of Information and Communication Technologies for Sustainability (ICT4S), held in Zurich on February 14-16, 2013, gathered more than 200 researchers and decision makers from 50 countries to exchange their insights about an effective contribution of ICT to sustainable development. The papers presented at the conference are contained in this volume. These contributions show the multi-facetted relationship between Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and issues of sustainability. First, although creating virtual worlds, these technologies are physically dependent on the supply of energy and scarce materials. How can we reduce the ecological footprint of ICT? (Sustainability in ICT) Second, ICTs are enabling technologies with the potential to increase the energy and material efficiency of production and consumption patterns and processes. Essentially depending on the socio-economic framework, they can support the decoupling of value creation from resource use instead of accelerating resource-intensive processes (Sustainability by ICT). Third, the computational models we can design and implement with the aid of ICT contribute to our understanding of complex systems. These models and the applications based on them support the creation and assessment of potential solutions to urgent problems, among them climate change (Sustainability Research by ICT). The following cross-cutting issues have been repeatedly addressed in the contributions to the ICT4S 2013 conference, thus defining the outline of a research agenda in the emerging field of ICT for Sustainability: 1. The power of software: How can we use the power of software to reduce hardware energy consumption? 2. Scarce materials used in ICT hardware: How can we reduce hardware obsolescence and close material cycles? 3. Smart energy use in buildings: How can we manage the energy used in buildings smarter and thereby reduce this largest fraction of our total energy consumption? 4. Sustainable behaviours and lifestyles: How can ICT be used to support users in making choices that contribute to sustainable development? The presentations and discussions of the conference are also available as podcasts and visual protocols via the website http://www.ict4s.org.",

Residual treatment-surviving leukemia is considered responsible for the outgrowth of AML. In many retrospective studies, detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) has been shown to enable identification of these poor-outcome patients by showing its independent prognostic impact. Most studies focus on molecular markers or analyze data in retrospect. This study establishes the value of immunophenotypically assessed MRD in the context of a multicenter clinical trial in adult AML with sample collection and analysis performed in a few specialized centers.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In adults (younger than age 60 years) with AML enrolled onto the Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group/Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research Acute Myeloid Leukemia 42A study, MRD was evaluated in bone marrow samples in CR (164 after induction cycle 1, 183 after cycle 2, 124 after consolidation therapy).\r\nRESULTS: After all courses of therapy, low MRD values distinguished patients with relatively favorable outcome from those with high relapse rate and adverse relapse-free and overall survival. In the whole patient group and in the subgroup with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, MRD was an independent prognostic factor. Multivariate analysis after cycle 2, when decisions about consolidation treatment have to be made, confirmed that high MRD values (> 0.1% of WBC) were associated with a higher risk of relapse after adjustment for consolidation treatment time-dependent covariate risk score and early or later CR.\r\nCONCLUSION: In future treatment studies, risk stratification should be based not only on risk estimation assessed at diagnosis but also on MRD as a therapy-dependent prognostic factor.",

Selumetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, has shown antitumour activity in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma and in preclinical models when combined with chemotherapy. This study was designed to look for a signal of improved efficacy by comparing the combination of selumetinib and dacarbazine with dacarbazine alone. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 study investigated selumetinib plus dacarbazine versus placebo plus dacarbazine as first-line treatment in patients older than 18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced BRAF-mutant cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma. Patients were randomly assigned by central interactive voice response system (1:1 ratio, block size four) to take either oral selumetinib (75 mg twice daily in a 21-day cycle) or placebo; all patients received intravenous dacarbazine (1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle). Patients, investigators, and the study team were masked to the treatment assigned. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00936221. FINDINGS: Between July 20, 2009, and April 8, 2010, 91 patients were randomly assigned to receive dacarbazine in combination with selumetinib (n=45) or placebo (n=46). Overall survival did not differ significantly between groups (median 13\u00b79 months, 80% CI 10\u00b72-15\u00b76, in the selumetinib plus dacarbazine group and 10\u00b75 months, 9\u00b76-14\u00b77, in the placebo plus dacarbazine group; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b793, 80% CI 0\u00b767-1\u00b728, one-sided p=0\u00b739). However, progression-free survival was significantly improved in the selumetinib plus dacarbazine group versus the placebo plus dacarbazine group (HR 0\u00b763, 80% CI 0\u00b747-0\u00b784, one-sided p=0\u00b7021), with a median of 5\u00b76 months (80% CI 4\u00b79-5\u00b79) versus 3\u00b70 months (2\u00b78-4\u00b76), respectively. The most frequent adverse events included nausea (28 [64%] of 44 patients on selumetinib vs 25 [56%] of 45 on placebo), acneiform dermatitis (23 [52%] vs one [2%]), diarrhoea (21 [48%] vs 13 [29%]), vomiting (21 [48%] vs 15 [33%]), and peripheral oedema (19 [43%] vs three [7%]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (six [14%] patients in the selumetinib plus dacarbazine group vs four [9%] in the placebo plus dacarbazine group). INTERPRETATION: Selumetinib plus dacarbazine showed clinical activity in patients with BRAF-mutant cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma, reflected by a significant benefit in progression-free survival compared with placebo plus dacarbazine group, although no significant change in overall survival was noted. The tolerability of this combination was generally consistent with monotherapy safety profiles.",

Satellite measurements of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) since 1981 provide a global yardstick, revealing that a quarter of the land surface has been degrading over the last quarter of a century; every continent and biome is affected with Africa south of the equator, southeast (SE) Asia and south (S) China hardest hit. The loss of primary productivity is equivalent to more than a billion Mg C but the associated emissions from loss of biomass and soil organic carbon are much greater. Degradation is not confined to farmland (18 % of the degrading area is cropland; 47 % is classed as forest); neither is it strongly associated with drylands, population pressure or poverty. A case study using more detailed data for China explores the effects of soil resilience and the association between land degradation and land use. NDVI can only be a proxy measure of land degradation; assessment of ecosystem services is a further step removed. Remotely-\u00adsensed data can be used along with climatic and topographic data as an input to models that predict the provision of these services but the processes, drivers and effects beyond NPP are unseen and more importantly, unmeasured. This is an issue for emerging markets in environmental services.",

Since tumor cells penetrate the surrounding brain tissue, complete surgical resection is impossible and tumor recurrence is almost a certainty. New treatment modalities are therefore needed, and these should be able to trace, identify, and kill dispersed tumor cells with great accuracy. Immunological approaches in principle meet these needs. Unfortunately, due to profound tumor-associated mechanisms of immunosuppression and -evasion, immunotherapeutic strategies like peptide vaccination have so far not been translated into clinical success. If future, peptide-based vaccination approaches shall be successful in glioblastoma therapy, multiple questions need to be solved including identification of suitable antigens, route and mode of vaccination, preparation of the tumor-bearing \"host\" and antagonizing, as much as this is possible, glioblastoma-associated mechanisms of immune evasion and poor vaccination response. In this review we will address the immunological challenges of glioblastoma and discuss key aspects that have rendered successful immunotherapy difficult in the past.",

A connection between calcium-deficient nutrition and other unhealthy lifestyles such as lack of exercise, smoking (> 10 cigarettes/day) and regular alcohol intake (several glasses/day) has been shown by multivariate analysis. Therefore one has to suspect, that every third to fourth woman having several risk factors is at risk at entry in menopause. Primary prevention as a population-oriented strategy is therefore sought by general health-education and prevention of accidents in order to lower risks for fractures. Fractures of the collum femoris alone are on the basis of actual life expectancy in Switzerland responsible for 157,000 hospital days in women and 18,000 in men, corresponding to the annual capacity of an acute-cave hospital with 500 beds. With the aid of a risk-group strategy therefore attempts at secondary prevention are necessary. As a cost-effective screening-test every postmenopausal woman should receive a peripheral quantitative computer-tomography. Women with relatively high bone loss-rates and/or low bone density (insufficient stability) could thus be recognized and offered the benefit of an individualized compliance-promoting protective treatment.",

Few modern papers, however, examine this question. The aim of this study is therefore to determine whether POT affects oncologic outcome with an emphasis on stomal/peristomal recurrence. This is a retrospective case note review of 60 consecutive patients undergoing curative primary total laryngectomy (TL) for advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Demographic, staging, treatment and outcome data were collected. 27/60 (45 %) patients had POT and 33/60 did not. No patient underwent laser debulking. Median age was 62 years (39-90 years) and median follow-up of survivors was 31 months. 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) of patients undergoing POT versus no POT was 28 versus 39 % (p = 0.947), 55 versus 46 % (p = 0.201) and 96 versus 88 % (p = 0.324) respectively. No statistically significant difference in OS, DSS and LRFS was found between patients undergoing POT and those not. Despite the relatively small case series, this evidence should reassure surgeons without the ability to perform trans-oral debulking that they should not hesitate to perform tracheostomy on a patient with airway obstruction due to laryngeal cancer. Appropriate definitive treatment meant that POT was not a risk factor for poor oncological outcome in our series.",

Analysis of the National Hospital Discharge Survey database from 1990 to 2007.Objective. To evaluate the influence of preoperative depression, anxiety, schizophrenia or dementia on in hospital (1) adverse events, (2) mortality and (3) non-routine discharge in patients undergoing major spine surgery.Summary of Background Data. Psychiatric comorbidity is a known risk factor for impaired health-related quality of life and poor long-term outcomes following spine surgery, yet little is known about its impact in the perioperative spine surgery setting.Methods. Using the National Hospital Discharge Survey database, all patients undergoing either spinal fusion or laminectomy between 1990 and 2007 were identified and separated into groups with and without psychiatric disorders. Multivariable regression analysis was performed for each of the outcome variables.Results. Between 1990 and 2007, a total estimated number of 5,382,343 spinal fusions and laminectomies were performed. The prevalence of diagnosed depression, anxiety and schizophrenia among the study population increased significantly over time. Depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and dementia were associated with higher rates of non-routine discharge. Depression, schizophrenia and dementia were associated with higher rates of adverse events. Dementia was the only psychiatric disorder associated with a higher risk of in hospital mortality.Conclusion. Patients with preoperative psychiatric disorders undergoing major spine surgery are at increased risk for perioperative adverse events and post hospitalization care, but its effect in perioperative mortality is more limited. Pre-surgical psychological screening of spine surgery candidates might ultimately lead to the enhancement of perioperative outcomes in this growing segment of the US population.",

        "document": "Title: CD44 enhances tumor formation and lung metastasis in experimental osteosarcoma and is an additional predictor for poor patient outcome\nAbstract: Formation of metastases in the lungs is the major cause of death in patients suffering from osteosarcoma (OS). Metastases at presentation and poor response to preoperative chemotherapy are strong predictors for poor patient outcome. The elucidation of molecular markers that promote metastasis formation and/or chemoresistance is therefore of importance. CD44 is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that binds to the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan (HA) and has been shown to be involved in metastasis formation in a variety of other tumors. Here we investigated the role of CD44 expression on OS tumor formation and metastasis. High CD44 expression, evaluated with a tissue microarray including samples from 53 OS patients and stained with a pan-CD44 antibody (Hermes3), showed a tendency (p\u2009<\u20090.08) to shortened overall survival. However, nonresponders and patients with lung metastases and high CD44 expression had significantly poorer prognosis than patients with low CD44 expression. Overexpression of the standard CD44 isoform (CD44s) and its HA-binding defective mutant R41A in osteoblastic SaOS-2 cells resulted in HA-independent higher migration rates and increased chemoresistance, partially dependent on HA. In an orthotopic mouse model of OS, overexpression of CD44s in SaOS-2 cells resulted in an HA-dependent increased primary tumor formation and increased numbers of micrometastases and macrometastases in the lungs. In conclusion, although CD44 failed to be an independent predictor for patient outcome in this limited cohort of OS patients, increased CD44 expression was associated with even worse survival in patients with chemoresistance and with lung metastases. CD44-associated chemoresistance was also observed in vitro, and increased formation of lung metastases was found in vivo in SCID mice.",

A simple clinical test of sufficient validity would be desirable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of a new PSIS distraction test for the clinical detection of SIJ arthropathy and to compare it to several commonly used clinical tests. METHODS: Consecutive patients, where a SIJ pathology had been confirmed by an SIJ infiltration were enrolled (case group, 61 SIJs in 46 patients). Before infiltration, patients were tested for pain with PSIS distraction by a punctual force on the PSIS in medial-to-lateral direction (PSIS distraction test), pain with pelvic compression, pelvic distraction, Gaenslen test, Thigh Thrust, and Faber (or Patrick's) test. In addition, these clinical tests were applied to both SIJs of a population of individuals without history of LBP (control group, 64 SIJs in 32 patients). RESULTS: Within the investigated cohort, the PSIS distraction test showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89% for SIJ pathology. The accuracy of the test was 94%, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 90% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%. Pelvic compression, pelvic distraction, Gaenslen test, Thigh Thrust, and Faber test were associated with a good specificity (> 90%) but a poor sensitivity (< 35%). CONCLUSIONS: Within our population of patients with confirmed SIJ arthropathy the PSIS distraction test was found to be of high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. In contrast, common clinical tests showed a poor sensitivity. The PSIS distraction test seems to be an easy-to-perform and clinically valuable test for SIJ arthropathy.",

How can we explain this increase in inequalities? Policies in labor markets, social policy, and political representation are strongly linked in the creation, widening, and deepening of insider-outsider divides\u2014a process known as dualization. While it is certainly not the only driver of increasing inequality, the encompassing nature of its development across multiple domains makes dualization one of the most important current trends affecting developed societies. However, the extent and forms of dualization vary greatly across countries. The comparative perspective of this book provides insights into why Nordic countries witness lower levels of insider-outsider divides, whereas in continental, liberal and southern welfare states, they are more likely to constitute a core characteristic of the political economy. Most importantly, the comparisons presented in this book point to the crucial importance of politics and political choice in driving and shaping the social outcomes of deindustrialization. While increased structural labor market divides can be found across all countries, governments have a strong responsibility in shaping the distributive consequences of these labor market changes. Insider-outsider divides are not a straightforward consequence of deindustrialization, but rather the result of political choice.",

The purpose of this study was to report our outcomes following fixation of this posterior pilon fracture and to describe a novel classification system to help guide operative planning and fixation. METHODS: Eleven patients were identified following fixation of a posterior pilon fracture over a 4-year span; 7 returned at minimum 1-year follow-up to complete a physical examination, radiographs, and RAND-36 (health-related quality of life score developed at RAND [Research and Development Corporation] as part of the Medical Outcomes Study) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle/hindfoot questionnaires. Patient records were reviewed to evaluate for secondary complications or operative procedures. RESULTS: Our mean postoperative AOFAS ankle/hindfoot score was 82. Anatomical reduction of the plafond was noted radiographically in 7 of 11 patients, with the remainder demonstrating less than 2 mm of articular incongruity. Five of 7 patients demonstrated ankle and hindfoot range of motion within 5 degrees of the uninvolved extremity. Four complications required operative intervention; 2 patients reported continued pain secondary to development of CRPS. CONCLUSION: The posterior pilon fracture is a challenging fracture pattern to treat, and it has unique characteristics that require careful attention to operative technique. Our results following fixation of this fracture pattern are comparable with results in the literature. In addition, a novel classification scheme is described to guide recognition and treatment of this fracture pattern. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, retrospective case series.",

        "document": "Title: The social gradient in work and health: a cross-sectional study exploring the relationship between working conditions and health inequalities\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Social inequalities in health are widely examined. But the reasons behind this phenomenon still remain unclear in parts. It is undisputed that the work environment plays a crucial role in this regard. However, the contribution of psychosocial factors at work is unclear and inconsistent, and most studies are limited with regard to work factors and health outcomes. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the role and contribution of various physical and psychosocial working conditions to explaining social inequalities in different self-reported health outcomes. METHODS: Data from a postal survey among the workforces of four medium-sized and large companies from diverse industries of the secondary sector in Switzerland were used and analysed. The study sample covered 1,846 employees aged 20 and 64 and included significant proportions of unskilled manual workers and highly qualified non-manual workers. Cross tabulations and logistic regression analyses were performed to study multiple associations between social status, work factors and health outcomes. Combinations of educational level and occupational position wee used as a measure of social status or class. RESULTS: Clear social gradients were observed for almost all adverse working conditions and poor health outcomes studied, but in different directions. While physical workloads and other typical blue-collar job characteristics not suprisingly, were found to be much more common among the lower classes, most psychosocial work demands and job resources were more prevalent in the higher classes. Furthermore, workers in lower classes, i.e. with lower educational and occupational status, were more likely to report poor self-rated health, limited physical functioning and long sickness absence, but at the same time were less likely to experience increased stress feelings and burnout symptoms showing a reversed health gradient. Finally, blue-collar job characteristics contributed substantially to the social gradient found in general and physical health outcomes. In contrast, white-collar job characteristics made no contribution to explaining the gradient in these health outcomes, but instead largely explained the reversed social gradient observed for the mental health outcomes. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a more differentiated pattern of the commonly found social gradient in health and the differential role of work in this respect.",

Infection with these so-called zoonotic parasites may vary from asymptomatic carriership to long-term morbidity and even death. Although data are still scarce, it is clear that parasitic zoonoses (PZs) present a significant burden for public health, particularly in poor and marginalized communities. So far, however, there has been relatively little attention to this group of diseases, causing various PZs to be labeled neglected tropical diseases. In this study, the authors reviewed a large variety of data sources to study the relevance and importance of PZs in Nepal. It was found that a large number of PZs are present in Nepal and are imposing an impact higher than that of malaria and comparable to that of HIV/AIDS. These results therefore suggest that PZs deserve greater attention and more intensive surveillance. Furthermore, this study has shown that even in settings with limited surveillance capacity, it is possible to quantify the impact of neglected diseases and, consequently, to break the vicious circle of neglect.",

Physical work factors included five demands and exposures such as heavy loads, repetitive work and poor posture. Psychosocial factors included 14 demands and limited resources such as time pressure, overtime, monotonous work, job insecurity, low job autonomy, low social support and work-life conflict. Health outcomes studied were self-rated health, sickness absence, musculoskeletal disorders, sleep disorders, stress and burnout.ResultsThere was a response rate of 49%; 2014 employees participated. All adverse working conditions were positively associated with several poor health outcomes in both men and women. After mutual adjustment for all work factors and additional covariates, only a few, mainly psychosocial work factors remained significant as risk factors for health. Work-life conflict, a largely neglected work-related psychosocial factor in occupational medicine, turned out to be the only factor that was significantly and strongly associated with all studied health outcomes and was consistently found to be the strongest or second strongest of all the studied risk factors.ConclusionsEven in an industrial work environment, psychosocial work factors, and particularly work-life conflict, play a key role and need to be taken into consideration in research and workplace health promotion.",

Parents completed a standardized questionnaire on child HRQoL at 1 year and 4 years of age; medical data were extracted from the patients' hospital records.\r\nRESULTS: Parents reported a significant reduction of the children's physical functioning compared with healthy controls at age 1 year. At age 4 years, children with CHD had poorer cognitive functioning but better social functioning compared with healthy controls. Lower HRQoL at age 4 years was not significantly predicted by univentricular or biventricular CHD but was predicted by the presence of an underlying genetic defect, tube feeding at 1 year, and lower HRQoL at 1 year.\r\nCONCLUSION: This study shows that HRQoL of infants and preschool-age children with CHD is impaired in physical and cognitive dimensions. Children with lower overall HRQoL at age 1 year, an underlying genetic defect, and tube feeding need to be monitored carefully to provide appropriate and timely interventions.",

Thousands of poor farmers are completely dependent on land for their livelihoods, yet not all of them have access to or control over this fundamental resource. Negotiation for access to land has been a lengthy and complicated process. It remains so in the changed political context of Nepal, where increasing numbers of emerging actors need to be considered, often with conflicting claims and counterclaims.

Treatment with ephedrine or salbutamol is effective, but diagnosis is often delayed. The aim of our study was to find early clues to the diagnosis of DOK7 congenital myasthenic syndrome. We included 23 children of 20 families. Onset of symptoms ranged from birth to age 3 years. 13 presented at birth with feeding difficulties, 11 with stridor (documented vocal cord palsy in 7), 3/11 with hypotonia/poor head control. Weakness was more pronounced proximally in all, axial in early presenting infants. Muscle biopsy showed non-specific features in 15/16, type 1 fibre predominance in 14/16, areas devoid of oxidative enzyme activity in 7/16. Muscle imaging was normal in 8/10, 2/10 showed mild non-specific changes. A diagnostic clue suggesting CMS rather than myopathy was the discrepancy between muscle imaging or histology findings compared with the degree of weakness. Repetitive nerve stimulation and stimulation single fibre electromyography were pathological in 9/17 and 13/14, respectively. In conclusion, stridor and feeding difficulties at birth or progressive weakness despite normal milestones in infancy point to the diagnosis and should lead to neurophysiological and genetic investigation. Fatigability can be absent or easily missed in the first years of life.",

Currently, there are no disease-specific instruments to assess the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of pre-school children. The aims of this study were to develop a parent proxy instrument to measure the HrQoL of children aged 3-7\u00a0years with a heart disease and to confirm its validity and reliability.\r\nMETHODS: Items from the Preschool Pediatric Cardiac Quality of Life Inventory (P-PCQLI) were generated through focus groups of caregivers. In a pilot study, comprehensibility and feasibility were tested. Five subdimensions were defined theoretically. Psychometric properties were analysed within a multicentre study with 167 parental caregivers.\r\nRESULTS: The final 52-item instrument contains a total score covering five moderately inter-correlated dimensions. The total score of the questionnaire showed a very high internal consistency (Cronbachs' \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.95). Test-retest correlation was at r tt\u00a0=\u00a00.96. External validity was indicated by higher correlations (r\u00a0=\u00a00.24-0.68) with a generic paediatric quality of life questionnaire (KINDL) compared to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (r\u00a0=\u00a00.17 to 0.59). Low P-PCQLI total scores were significantly associated with inpatient as opposed to outpatient treatment (t\u00a0=\u00a06.04, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), with at least moderate disease severity ((t\u00a0=\u00a05.05, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) NYHA classification) and with poorer prognosis (t\u00a0=\u00a05.53, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) as estimated by the physician.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The P-PCQLI is reliable and valid for pre-school children with a heart disease. It could be used as a screening instrument in routine care, and for evaluation of HrQoL outcomes in clinical trials and intervention research.",

The objective of the present work was to identify important diagnostic indicators and their accuracy for specific and non-specific conditions underlying NCCP. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. In May 2012, six databases were searched. Hand and bibliography searches were also conducted. Studies evaluating a diagnostic test against a reference test in patients with NCCP were included. Exclusion criteria were having <30 patients per group, and evaluating diagnostic tests for acute cardiovascular disease. Diagnostic accuracy is given in likelihood ratios (LR): very good (LR+ >10, LR- <0.1); good (LR + 5 to 10, LR- 0.1 to 0.2); fair (LR + 2 to 5, LR- 0.2 to 0.5); or poor (LR + 1 to 2, LR- 0.5 to 1). Joined meta-analysis of the diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity was performed by applying a hierarchical Bayesian model. RESULTS: Out of 6,316 records, 260 were reviewed in full text, and 28 were included: 20 investigating gastroesophageal reflux disorders (GERD), 3 musculoskeletal chest pain, and 5 psychiatric conditions. Study quality was good in 15 studies and moderate in 13. GERD diagnosis was more likely with typical GERD symptoms (LR + 2.70 and 2.75, LR- 0.42 and 0.78) than atypical GERD symptoms (LR + 0.49, LR- 2.71). GERD was also more likely with a positive response to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) test (LR + 5.48, 7.13, and 8.56; LR- 0.24, 0.25, and 0.28); the posterior mean sensitivity and specificity of six studies were 0.89 (95% credible interval, 0.28 to 1) and 0.88 (95% credible interval, 0.26 to 1), respectively. Panic and anxiety screening scores can identify individuals requiring further testing for anxiety or panic disorders. Clinical findings in musculoskeletal pain either had a fair to moderate LR + and a poor LR- or vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NCCP, thorough clinical evaluation of the patient's history, symptoms, and clinical findings can indicate the most appropriate diagnostic tests. Treatment response to high-dose PPI treatment provides important information regarding GERD, and should be considered early. Panic and anxiety disorders are often undiagnosed and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain.",

The number of cases of severe complications due to bolus application that have been referred to our hospital has increased from nil between 1996 and 2008 to three or four per year. In our experience, reports by bovine veterinarians of patients with severe and often fatal pharyngeal trauma, which were not referred to the clinic, have become more common in recent years as well. The incidence of this complication is likely to be higher than this number of referrals suggests. Diagnosis without the help of imaging techniques, such as radiography and endoscopy, may be difficult, especially in cases where exploration of the pharynx cannot be carried out, or is unable to confirm the absence or presence of a lesion. Prognosis is often poor in cases where perforation has been confirmed. Boluses are increasingly administered by the owners or farm personnel without the supervision of a veterinarian. In order to prevent losses due to balling gun-induced injuries, the veterinarian plays a crucial role in giving advice to his clients. Five cases of cattle suffering from varying degrees of balling gun-induced trauma are presented, and consideration is given to incorrect application techniques.",

While co-morbidity has been associated with poorer health status, it is unclear which conditions have the greatest impact on self-rated health. We sought to determine which, and how much, specific co-morbid conditions impact on self-rated health in current and former smokers with self-reported COPD. Using the 2001-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey we characterized the association between thirteen co-morbidities and health status among individuals self-reporting COPD. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were generated using ordinal logistic regression. Additionally we evaluated the impact of increasing number of co-morbidities with self-rated health. Eight illnesses had significant associations with worse self-rated health, however after mutually adjusting for these conditions, congestive heart failure (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.69-5.58), arthritis (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.13-2.52), diabetes (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.01-2.64), and incontinence/prostate disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.01-2.62) remained independent predictors of self-rated health. Each increase in co-morbidities was associated with a 43% higher chance of worse self-rated health (95% CI 1.27-1.62). Individuals with COPD have a substantial burden of co-morbidity, which is associated with worse self-rated health. CHF, arthritis, diabetes and incontinence/prostate disease have the most impact on self-rated health. Targeting these co-morbidities in COPD may result in improved self-rated health.",

Fractures of the proximal humerus were examined with anteroposterior, lateral, and axillary radiographs. Three independent reviewers classified the fractures using the AO, Neer, and HGLS systems. Reclassification of the same fractures was undertaken after a 6-month interval, and interobserver and intraobserver correlation, by use of the \u03ba statistic, was calculated for all 3 classification systems.\r\nRESULTS: The mean age of patients was 64.5 years (range, 16-95 years). The interobserver correlations for the AO system (\u03ba value, 0.47) and Neer system (\u03ba value, 0.44) were graded as poor and were consistent with the values of previously published studies. The HGLS classification showed good interobserver agreement for all 3 examiners at the first interpretation (\u03ba value, 0.73) and second interpretation (\u03ba value, 0.61). Good intraobserver agreement after a 6-month period was also seen for the HGLS classification (\u03ba values, 0.87-0.92) compared with the AO system (\u03ba, 0.61-0.71) and Neer system (\u03ba, 0.42-0.77).\r\nCONCLUSION: The HGLS system provided a more reliable description of fractures of the proximal humerus compared with the Neer and AO systems. Further studies are necessary to assess the validity of the HGLS system.",

Evidence from a three-wave panel survey in a political campaign\nAbstract: In Western democracies, the public harbors mostly negative attitudes toward ethnic minorities and favors policy programs intended to restrict immigration (Pettigrew, Wagner, & Christ, 2007). In some cases, these prejudices may stem from the coverage of ethnic minorities in the news media. On U.S. television, ethnic minorities are typically portrayed negatively, for example, as being poor or violent, as well as being loud politicians, or criminals (Dixon & Linz, 2000; Entman & Rojecki, 2000). Studies from Europe also reveal that racial bias is a core component of media reporting on ethnic minorities (e.g., Lubbers, Scheepers, & Wester, 1998; Ruhrmann, 2002). Given that media coverage of minorities is overwhelmingly negatively biased, exposure to such news is likely to perpetuate ethnic prejudice (Mastro, 2009).",

This study aims to determine the incidence and assess the functional and radiological outcome after such fractures.\r\nMETHODS: 484 consecutive total hip replacements (THR) (64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0years) were analyzed. We treated trochanteric fractures conservatively without any further denuding, and secured metaphyseal fissures with cerclages. Postoperative X-rays and at the latest follow-up were compared to assess secondary fracture displacement and stem subsidence. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores after 1\u00a0year were analyzed. For each patient sustaining a fracture, two patients without fractures were matched in terms of age, body mass index and gender.\r\nRESULTS: 13 (2.7\u00a0%, 5 male, 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0years) patients with intraoperative fractures of the greater trochanter (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or the metaphysis (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were analyzed. Consolidation was observed in 7/8 patients sustaining a trochanteric fracture while secondary displacement of the fragment occurred in one case. Stem subsidence was observed in 2/5 cases (5 and 7\u00a0mm). Patients who sustained a fracture showed a trend towards poorer WOMAC scores at 1\u00a0year postoperatively, compared to patients without fractures. A significantly increased joint stiffness was also observed.\r\nCONCLUSION: The intraoperative fracture risk in this series of THR through a direct anterior approach was 2.7\u00a0%. Trochanteric fractures do heal without primary fixation. Metaphyseal fractures heal well if immediately stabilized with a cerclage.",

We examined whether the timing of internal (endogenous) circadian melatonin phase (i.e., dim light melatonin onset; DLMO) and its relationship with parent-selected bedtimes were related to nighttime settling behaviors. Fourteen regularly napping preschoolers (8 females; 30\u201336\u2009months) participated in a 6-day protocol (parent-report of nighttime settling, actigraphic assessment of sleep onset latency, evening salivary DLMO). Average DLMO clock time was 07:40\u2009p.m.\u2009\u00b1\u200900:48\u2009minutes, occurring 29\u2009minutes\u2009\u00b1\u200932\u2009minutes prior to bedtime (lights-out). Children with later DLMOs had longer sleep-onset latencies (r\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009.62) and poorer success in falling asleep (r\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2212.59). Children whose bedtimes were closer to their DLMO had longer sleep-onset latencies (r\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009.72) and increased bedtime resistance (r\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2212.54). We conclude that dissonance between parent-selected bedtimes and children's circadian physiology may contribute to the development of nighttime settling difficulties in early childhood.",

Peak ammonia level was 963 \u03bcM in patients with proximal UCDs (CPSD or OTCD), compared with 589 \u03bcM in ASD and 573 \u03bcM in ALD. Roughly 25% of subjects with CPSD or OTCD, 18% of those with ASD, and 67% of those with ALD had a \"honeymoon period,\" defined as the time interval from discharge from initial admission to subsequent admission for hyperammonemia, greater than 1 year. The proportion of patients with a poor outcome (IQ/Developmental Quotient <70) was greatest in ALD (68%), followed by ASD (54%) and CPSD/OTCD (47%). This trend was not significant, but was observed in both patients aged <4 years and those aged \u2265 4 years. Poor cognitive outcome was not correlated with peak ammonia level or duration of initial admission.\r\nCONCLUSION: Neurocognitive outcomes do not differ between patients with proximal UCDs and those with distal UCDs. Factors other than hyperammonemia may contribute to poor neurocognitive outcome in the distal UCDs.",

Late booking or low number of checks are often used as surrogate for poor quality, leaving uncertainty on the actual content of the care received. In order to fill this gap, we have reviewed two sets of clinical guidelines and developed corresponding indicators of quality.\r\nMETHOD: A group of clinicians and methodologists reviewed the National Institute for Clinical Excellency Clinical Guidelines on antenatal care, and the list of prenatal care interventions recommended by the Research and Development Group, both based on evidence of effectiveness of specific interventions. We identified single aspects in three domains: (1) services utilization; (2) screening; and (3) interventions. For each indicator, we defined: (1) eligibility, that is the characteristics of the women to whom the indicator applies; (2) standard, that is the situation when the target is met; and (3) moderators, that is all conditions which legitimately hamper the fulfilment of the standard.\r\nRESULTS: We developed four indicators of service utilization, 25 of screening and 17 of intervention. The respective eligibility, standard and moderators criteria were described for each indicator. While many indicators could be retrospectively evaluated from medical charts, quality of communication with provider, screening for sensible issues and counselling on behaviours to be avoided could only be obtained with a prospective data collection.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The indicators of quality of antenatal care, complemented by measures of social position, social support and immigrant/ethnic status, allow for a careful description of the gaps in quality of care for specific groups of women.",

Thus, it is of interest to examine the effect of natural estrogens such as phytoestrogens on the risk of depression in perimenopausal women.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nOur analysis included 193 perimenopausal women of the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) 2005-2008 aged 45-55 years. Urinary concentrations of phytoestrogens (isoflavones and lignans) were measured by HPLC-APPI-MS/MS. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Logistic regression models examined the association of phytoestrogens concentrations (creatinine-standardized and log-transformed) with depression (yes/no).\r\nRESULTS:\r\nUnadjusted odds ratios (OR) of the associations between urinary phytoestrogen concentrations and perimenopausal depression were below 1; however, only lignans were significantly inversely associated with depression. The latter findings were not attenuated in multivariate analysis including age, race, body mass index, poverty income ratio, smoking, alcohol consumption, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (lignans: OR=0.66; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.50-0.87, enterodiol: OR=0.63; 95% CI 0.51-0.78, enterolactone: OR=0.75; 95% CI 0.60-0.93).\r\nLIMITATIONS:\r\nOur cross-sectional study design does not allow for causal inferences. Because information to precisely assess perimenopausal symptoms was missing, we defined perimenopause based on women's age.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nLower lignans but not isoflavones concentrations were statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of depression in perimenopausal women. Because of medical risks associated with the use of hormone therapy, further investigation on the effect of lignans on the risk of depression in perimenopausal women is warranted.",

Impaired iron homeostasis may be one mechanism underlying the poor physical condition of CHF patients. This detailed subanalysis of the previously published FAIR-HF study evaluated baseline HRQoL in iron-deficient patients with CHF and the effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) on HRQoL.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: FAIR-HF randomized 459 patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, to FCM or placebo (2:1). Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of therapy using the generic EQ-5D questionnaire and disease-specific Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire (KCCQ). Baseline mean visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 54.3 \u00b1 16.4 and KCCQ overall summary score was 52.4 \u00b1 18.8. Ferric carboxymaltose significantly improved VAS and KCCQ (mean differences from baseline in KCCQ overall, clinical and total symptom scores, P< 0.001 vs. placebo) at all time points. At week 24, significant improvement vs. placebo was observed in four of the five EQ-5D dimensions: mobility (P= 0.004), self-care (P< 0.001), pain/discomfort (P= 0.006), anxiety/depression (P= 0.012), and usual activity (P= 0.035). Ferric carboxymaltose improved all KCCQ domain mean scores from Week 4 onward (P\u2264 0.05), except for self-efficacy and social limitation. Effects were present in both anaemic and non-anaemic patients.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: HRQoL is impaired in iron-deficient patients with CHF. Intravenous FCM significantly improved HRQoL after 4 weeks, and throughout the remaining study period. The positive effects of FCM were independent of anaemia status.",

To examine stigma- and knowledge-related barriers to help-seeking among members of the general population. Methods. In a representative survey of young to middle-aged Swiss adults (n\u00a0=\u00a08875), shame about a potential own mental illness, perceived knowledge about and satisfaction with one's mental health, psychiatric symptoms and attitudes towards help-seeking were assessed. Results. A latent profile analysis of all participants yielded two groups with different attitudes towards help-seeking. Relative to the majority, a one-in-four subgroup endorsed more negative attitudes towards seeking professional help, including psychiatric medication, and was characterized by more shame, less perceived knowledge, higher satisfaction with their mental health, younger age, male gender and lower education. Among participants with high symptom levels (n\u00a0=\u00a0855), a third subgroup was reluctant to seek help in their private environment and characterized by high symptoms as well as low satisfaction with their mental health. Conclusions. Shame as an emotional proxy of self-stigma as well as poor subjective mental health literacy may be independent barriers to help-seeking. Interventions to increase mental health service use could focus on both variables and on those individuals with more negative views about professional help, in the general public as well as among people with a current mental illness.",

However, few studies included all DSM-IV PDs and even fewer adjusted for other forms of childhood adversity, e.g. bullying or family problems.\r\nMETHOD: We analyzed questionnaires completed by 512 participants of the ZInEP epidemiology survey, a comprehensive psychiatric survey of the general population in Zurich, Switzerland. Associations between childhood adversity and PDs were analyzed bivariately via simple regression analyses and multivariately via multiple path analysis.\r\nRESULTS: The bivariate analyses revealed that all PD dimensions were significantly related to various forms of family and school problems as well as child abuse. In contrast, according to the multivariate analysis only school problems and emotional abuse were associated with various PDs. Poverty was uniquely associated with schizotypal PD, conflicts with parents with obsessive-compulsive PD, physical abuse with antisocial PD, and physical neglect with narcissistic PD. Sexual abuse was statistically significantly associated with schizotypal and borderline PD, but corresponding effect sizes were small.\r\nCONCLUSION: Childhood adversity has a serious impact on PDs. Bullying and violence in schools and emotional abuse appear to be more salient markers of general personality pathology than other forms of childhood adversity. Associations with sexual abuse were negligible when adjusted for other forms of adversity.",

Social deficits have rarely been studied in all PD dimensions to date.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: We analyzed 511 adults aged 20-41\u00a0years from the general population of the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, using data from the Epidemiology Survey of the Zurich Programme for Sustainable Development of Mental Health Services (ZInEP). PD dimensions were measured with a questionnaire and indicators of interpersonal functioning with a semi-structured interview. Associations were analyzed with generalized linear models.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: All PD dimensions were significantly associated with various indicators of interpersonal functioning deficits, such as distress and conflicts in friendships and partnership, feeling lonely, few close friends, and reduced social support. Schizotypal and borderline PD were relatively strongly associated with distress in friendships when compared with other PD dimensions. Furthermore, both dimensions were significantly related to all indicators of interpersonal functioning deficits.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Subjects scoring high on any PD dimension reported considerable deficits in interpersonal functioning as characterized by a solitary lifestyle, conflictual and distressful social relations, and lack of social support. All DSM-IV PDs are associated with poor interpersonal functioning, but there is some evidence that schizotypal and borderline symptomatology affects deficits in social interactions even more profoundly and pervasively than other PD dimensions.",

        "document": "Title: New directions in immunotherapy\nAbstract: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is effective in reducing the clinical symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis, asthma and venom-induced anaphylaxis. Subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with unmodified allergen extracts are the most widely prescribed AIT regimens. The efficacy of these 2 routes appears comparable, but the safety profile with SLIT is more favorable allowing for home administration and requiring less patient time. However, both require that the treatment is taken regularly over several years, e.g., monthly in a supervised medical setting with SCIT and daily at home with SLIT. Despite the difference in treatment settings, poor adherence has been reported with both routes. Emerging evidence suggests that AIT may be effective in other allergic conditions such as atopic dermatitis, venom sting-induced large local reactions, and food allergy. Research with oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergies suggest that many patients can be desensitized during treatment, but questions remain about whether this can produce long term tolerance. Further studies are needed to identify appropriate patients and treatment regimens with these conditions. Efforts to develop safer and more effective AIT for inhalant allergies have led to investigations with modified allergens and alternate routes. Intralymphatic (ILIT) has been shown to produce long-lasting clinical benefits after three injections comparable to a 3-year course of SCIT. Epicutaneous (EPIT) has demonstrated promising results for food and inhalant allergies. Vaccine modifications, such as T cell epitopes or the use of viral-like particles as an adjuvant, have been shown to provide sustained clinical benefits after a relatively short course of treatment compared to the currently available AIT treatments, SLIT and SCIT. These newer approaches may increase the utilization and adherence to AIT because the multi-year treatment requirement of currently available AIT is a likely deterrent for initiating and adhering to treatment.",

We examined the associations between low-grade inflammation and the development of allergic sensitization, atopic dermatitis (AD), and asthma at the age of 4.5\u00a0yr.\r\nMETHODS: We studied 636 children participating in the PASTURE study in Finland, Germany, Austria, France, and Switzerland. Data of environmental factors, doctor-diagnosed AD, and asthma were collected by questionnaire. The serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) values were measured at the age of 1\u00a0yr, and serum-specific IgE concentrations (sIgE) at the age of one and 4.5\u00a0yr. Analyses were made by logistic regression analysis.\r\nRESULTS: The risk of allergic sensitization at the age of 4.5\u00a0yr was decreased in children who had increased CRP levels at the age of 1\u00a0yr (level in the highest vs. lowest quartile: aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.95; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). The risk of AD and asthma was not significantly related to CRP.\r\nCONCLUSION: The findings confirm that elevated levels of CRP at early age showed association with decreased allergic sensitization later in life. Our results suggest that poor inflammatory response could predispose for IgE sensitization.",

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to aneurysm rupture might lead to a cerebral perfusion stop similar to OHCA. The current study analyzed the association of early PCT levels and outcome in patients after SAH.\r\nMethods - Data from 109 consecutive patients, admitted within 24 h after SAH, were analyzed. PCT levels were measured within 24 h after ictus. Clinical severity was determined using the World Federation of Neurological Societies (WFNS) scale and dichotomized into severe (grade 4\u20135) and non-severe (1\u20133). Neurological outcome after 3 months was assessed by the Glasgow outcome scale and dichotomized into unfavorable (1\u20133) and favourable (4\u20135). The predictive value was assessed using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis.\r\nResults - Systemic PCT levels were significantly higher in patients with severe SAH compared to those with nonsevere SAH: 0.06 \u00b1 0.04 versus 0.11 \u00b1 0.11 lg/l (median \u00b1 interquartile range; p < 0.01). Patients with unfavorable outcome had significantly higher PCT levels compared to those with favorable outcome 0.09 \u00b1 0.13 versus   0.07 \u00b1 0.15 ng/ml   (p < 0.01).   ROC   analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.66 (p < 0.01) for PCT, which was significantly lower than that of WFNS with 0.83 (p < 0.01).\r\nConclusions - Early PCT levels in patients with SAH might reflect the severity of the overall initial stress response. However, the predictive value is poor, especially compared to the reported predictive values in patients with OHCA. Early PCT levels might be of little use in pre- dicting neurological outcome after SAH.",

Previously, we reported on an association between systemic IL-6 levels and clinical outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH. The intention was to assess the impact of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen on the inflammatory response after SAH.\r\nMethods: Our method involved exploratory analysis of data and samples collected within a previous study. In 138 patients with SAH, systemic interleukin (IL-6) and c-reactive protein (CRP) were measured daily up to day 14 after SAH. The correlations among the cumulatively applied amount of NSAIDs, inflammatory parameters, and clinical outcome were calculated.\r\nResults An inverse correlation between cumulatively applied NSAIDs and both IL-6 and CRP levels was found (r = -0.437, p < 0.001 and r = -0.369, p < 0.001 respectively). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed a cumulative amount of NSAIDs to be independently predictive for systemic IL-6 and CRP levels. The cumulative amount of NSAIDs reduced the odds for unfavorable out- come, defined as Glasgow outcome scale 1\u20133.\r\nConclusions: The results indicate a potential beneficial effect of NSAIDs in patients with SAH in terms of ameliorating inflammatory response, which might have an impact on outcome.",

        "document": "Title: Self-reported sleep disturbances in renal transplant recipients\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Poor sleep quality (SQ) and daytime sleepiness (DS) are common in renal transplant (RTx) recipients; however, related data are rare. This study describes the prevalence and frequency of self-reported sleep disturbances in RTx recipients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 249 RTx recipients transplanted at three Swiss transplant centers. All had reported poor SQ and / or DS in a previous study. With the Survey of Sleep (SOS) self-report questionnaire, we screened for sleep and health habits, sleep history, main sleep problems and sleep-related disturbances. To determine a basis for preliminary sleep diagnoses according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD), 164 subjects were interviewed (48 in person, 116 via telephone and 85 refused). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data and to determine the frequencies and prevalences of specific sleep disorders. RESULTS: The sample had a mean age of 59.1 \u00b1 11.6 years (60.2% male); mean time since Tx was 11.1 \u00b1 7.0 years. The most frequent sleep problem was difficulty staying asleep (49.4%), followed by problems falling asleep (32.1%). The most prevalent sleep disturbance was the need to urinate (62.9%), and 27% reported reduced daytime functionality. Interview data showed that most suffered from the first ICSD category: insomnias. CONCLUSION: Though often disregarded in RTx recipients, sleep is an essential factor of wellbeing. Our findings show high prevalences and incidences of insomnias, with negative impacts on daytime functionality. This indicates a need for further research on the clinical consequences of sleep disturbances and the benefits of insomnia treatment in RTx recipients.",

Thus there is a need to assess daytime sleepiness in clinical practice and transplant registries.\r\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of a single-item measure of daytime sleepiness integrated in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS), using the American Educational Research Association framework.\r\nMETHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, we enrolled a convenience sample of 926 home-dwelling kidney transplant recipients (median age, 59.69 years; 25%-75% quartile [Q25-Q75], 50.27-59.69), 63% men; median time since transplant 9.42 years (Q25-Q75, 4.93-15.85). Daytime sleepiness was assessed by using a single item from the STCS and the 8 items of the validated Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff for the STCS daytime sleepiness item against the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score.\r\nRESULTS: Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a score greater than 4 on the STCS daytime sleepiness item is recommended to detect daytime sleepiness. Content validity was high as all expert reviews were unanimous. Concurrent validity was moderate (Spearman \u03f1, 0.531; P< .001) and convergent validity with depression and poor sleep quality although low, was significant (\u03f1, 0.235; P<.001 and \u03f1, 0.318, P=.002, respectively). For the group difference validity: kidney transplant recipients with moderate, severe, and extremely severe depressive symptom scores had 3.4, 4.3, and 5.9 times higher odds of having daytime sleepiness, respectively, as compared with recipients without depressive symptoms.\r\nCONCLUSION: The accumulated evidence provided evidence for the validity of the STCS daytime sleepiness item as a simple screening scale for daytime sleepiness.",

We investigated the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with advanced melanoma with symptomatic brain metastases.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: This open-label trial assessed vemurafenib (960mg twice a day) in patients with BRAF(V600) mutation-positive metastatic melanoma with non-resectable, previously treated brain metastases. The primary end-point was safety. Secondary end-points included best overall response rate, and progression-free and overall survival.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Twenty-four patients received vemurafenib for a median treatment duration of 3.8 (0.1-11.3) months. The majority of discontinuations were due to disease progression (n=22). Twenty-three of 24 patients reported at least one adverse event (AE). Grade 3 AEs were reported in four (17%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-37.4%) patients and included cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in four patients. Median progression-free survival was 3.9 (95% CI, 3.0-5.5) months, and median survival was 5.3 (95% CI, 3.9-6.6) months. An overall partial response (PR) at both intracranial and extracranial sites was achieved in 10 of 24 (42%; 95% CI, 22.1-63.4) evaluable patients, with stable disease in nine (38%; 95% CI, 18.8-59.4) patients. Of 19 patients with measurable intracranial disease, seven (37%) achieved >30% intracranial tumour regression, and three (16%; 95% CI, 3.4-39.6%) achieved a confirmed PR. Other signs of improvement included reduced need for corticosteroids and enhanced performance status.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Vemurafenib can be safely used in patients with advanced symptomatic melanoma that has metastasised to the brain and can result in meaningful tumour regression.",

Minor changes have been made to the description of the criteria, and there is a new emphasis on the clinical assessment of the patient's insight level (good, poor, absent). Obsessive-compulsive disorders associated with tic disorders are classified as a separate subtype.

However, less attention is being paid to the effects of biodiversity loss on environmental and commensal (indigenous) microbiotas. Metagenomic and other studies of healthy and diseased individuals reveal that reduced biodiversity and alterations in the composition of the gut and skin microbiota are associated with various inflammatory conditions, including asthma, allergic and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type1 diabetes, and obesity. Altered indigenous microbiota and the general microbial deprivation characterizing the lifestyle of urban people in affluent countries appear to be risk factors for immune dysregulation and impaired tolerance. The risk is further enhanced by physical inactivity and a western diet poor in fresh fruit and vegetables, which may act in synergy with dysbiosis of the gut flora. Studies of immigrants moving from non-affluent to affluent regions indicate that tolerance mechanisms can rapidly become impaired in microbe-poor environments. The data on microbial deprivation and immune dysfunction as they relate to biodiversity loss are evaluated in this Statement of World Allergy Organization (WAO). We propose that biodiversity, the variability among living organisms from all sources are closely related, at both the macro- and micro-levels. Loss of the macrodiversity is associated with shrinking of the microdiversity, which is associated with alterations of the indigenous microbiota. Data on behavioural means to induce tolerance are outlined and a proposal made for a Global Allergy Plan to prevent and reduce the global allergy burden for affected individuals and the societies in which they live.",

Poor dental health is frequently reported in the zoo literature, and abrasion-dominated tooth wear, which is typical for grazers, has been reported in captive browsing ruminants. The aim of this study was to test if a similar effect is evident in captive rhinoceros species. Dental casts of maxillary cheek teeth of museum specimens of captive black (Diceros bicornis; browser), greater one-horned (Rhinoceros unicornis; intermediate feeder) and white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum; grazer) were analysed using the recently developed extended mesowear method for rhinoceroses. Captive D. bicornis exhibited significantly more abrasion-dominated tooth wear than their free-ranging conspecifics (p<0.001), whereas captive C. simum exhibited significantly less abrasion-dominated tooth wear, particularly in the posterior cusp of the second molar (p=0.005). In R. unicornis, fewer differences were exhibited between free-ranging and captive animals, but tooth wear was highly variable in this species. In both free-ranging and captive D. bicornis, anterior cusps were significantly more abrasion-dominated than posterior cusps (p<0.05), which indicates morphological differences between cusps that may represent functional adaptations. By contrast, tooth wear gradients between free-ranging and captive animals differed, which indicates ingesta-specific influences responsible for inter-tooth wear differences. Captive D. bicornis exhibited more homogenous tooth wear than their free-ranging conspecifics, which may be caused by an increase in the absolute dietary abrasiveness and a decrease in relative environmental abrasiveness compared to their free-ranging conspecifics. The opposite occurred in C. simum. The results of this study suggest that diets fed to captive browsers are too abrasive, which could result in the premature loss of tooth functionality, leading to reduced food acquisition and processing ability and, consequently, malnourishment.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of a preoperative diagnosis of depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, or dementia on in-hospital (1) adverse events, (2) blood transfusion, and (3) nonroutine discharge in patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty.\r\nMETHODS: Using the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) database, we identified 348,824 discharges having undergone partial or total shoulder arthroplasty from 1990 to 2007. Multivariable regression analysis was performed for each of the outcome variables.\r\nRESULTS: The prevalence of diagnosed depressive disorder was 4.4%, anxiety disorder, 1.6%; schizophrenia, 0.6%; and dementia, 1.5%. Preoperative psychiatric disorders, with the exception of schizophrenia, were associated with higher rates of adverse events. Depression and schizophrenia were associated with higher perioperative rates of blood transfusion. Any preoperative psychiatric illness was associated with higher rates of nonroutine discharge.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with preoperative psychiatric illness undergoing shoulder arthroplasty are at increased risk for perioperative morbidity and posthospitalization care.

Studies carried out with scientifically monitored assessment examined the extent to which the most severely addicted can be guided to therapeutic options when all previous efforts to reach them have proved insufficient. This study describes the mental health of patients in heroin-assisted treatment.\r\nMethods: Entry criteria were minimal age of 20, minimal duration of daily opiate consumption of 2 years, negative outcome of at least 2 previous treatments, documented social and/or health deficits as a consequence of their opiate dependence. On admission and during all six month of treatment, the state of mental health was examined by physicians. External interviewers asked the patients about their mental symptoms.\r\nResults: On admission, 41 % of patients were found in a poor mental state. The mental-addictive disorder comorbidity rate was high. The treatment prevalence of schizophrenia was 9 %, of affective disorders 39 %, of personality disorders 68 %. The general state of mental health improved during treatment. The number of patients in mental state was already reduced by half after a few months. Accordingly the patients also indicated less mental disorders, and the number of hospital referrals declined by 59 %.\r\nConclusions: As is well known, mental disorders arise at an increased rate among intravenous drug addicts. The Swiss trials of medical prescription of narcotics reached a large group of patients with such disorders and symptoms. During the heroin-assisted treatment, a substantial improvement occurred in the mental health of these patients. In future, based on previous experience, psychiatric diagnosis and therapy for these out-patients should be improved even more.",

CASE PRESENTATION: The cows were ill and had poor appetite, salivation and regurgitation of poorly-chewed feed. Collection of rumen juice was successful in one cow, and in another, the tube could be advanced to the level of the 7th intercostal space, and in the third, only saliva could be collected. In one cow, oesophagoscopy revealed a discoloured 10-cm mucosal area with fibrin deposits. Thoracic radiographs were normal. The cows were euthanased and examined postmortem. Cow 1 had a large perioesophageal abscess containing feed material at the level of the thoracic inlet, believed to be the result of a healed oesophageal injury. Cow 2 had an abscess between the oesophagus and trachea 25 cm caudal to the epiglottis with the same presumed aetiology as in cow 1. Cow 3 had a mediastinal carcinoma that enclosed and constricted the oesophagus. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal regurgitation in cattle is usually the result of an oesophageal disorder. Causes of oesophageal disorders vary widely and their identification can be difficult.",

Sustainable development in marginal regions of South Asia\nAbstract: The population of the South Asian subcontinent includes 500 million people who subsist on less than one dollar a day and together make up 40 % of the world\u2019s poor. In a workshop, participants from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nepal, among them scientists as well as NGO representatives, joined together to determine the focus of NCCR North-South research activities in South Asia. The consensus was that core problems associated with syndromes of global change are most acute in marginal regions and among marginalised people. As many of South Asia\u2019s marginal areas are mountainous, problem clusters were considered to be specific to the \u201chighland-low-land\u201d syndrome context. It was concluded that within the JACS South Asia there is a need for research on the impact of global change upon marginal areas and within both the \u201chighland-lowland\u201d and the \u201curban-peri-urban\u201d syndrome contexts as defined by the NCCR. Research will therefore be focused upon marginal or fragile mountain areas (i.e. those at risk due to climatic or environmental conditions in addition to their economic situation). In selected case study localities, rural livelihood strategies will be analysed to identify key factors impacting upon sustainable development. Institutions and policies that shape important processes like natural resource use, migration and rural development will form the focus of analyses.",

An alternative strategy, providing couples with an instructional DVD, is tested in the present study, in which 330 Caucasian couples (N = 660 participants; mean age: men 41.4 years, women 40.0 years) were randomly assigned to a DVD group without any further support, a DVD group with technical telephone coaching, or a wait-list control group. Couples completed questionnaires at pretest, posttest, and 3 and 6 months after completion of the intervention. Self-report measures of dyadic coping, communication quality, ineffective arguing, and relationship satisfaction were used to test whether the intervention groups improved in comparison with the control group. Women in both intervention groups increased in dyadic coping, reduced conflict behavior, and were more satisfied with their relationship 6 months after the intervention. Effects for men were mixed. Participants with poorer skills reported stronger improvement. Intimate relationships can, within limits, be positively influenced by a self-directed approach. Effective dissemination of principles underlying successful relationships can be facilitated through the use of emerging low-cost tools and technologies.

When returns to capital and wages are imperfectly correlated a system that endows retired households with claims to labor income enhances the sharing of aggregate risk between generations. Our quantitative analysis shows that, abstracting from the capital crowding-out effect, the introduction of social security represents a Pareto improving reform, even when the economy is dynamically effcient. However, the severity of the crowding-out effect in general equilibrium tends to overturn these gains.",

Evaluating whether physicians respond appropriately to poor risk factor control gives a different picture of quality of care. We assessed physician response to control cardiovascular risk factors, as well as markers of potential overtreatment in Switzerland, a country with universal healthcare coverage but without systematic quality monitoring, annual report cards on quality of care or financial incentives to improve quality.\r\nMETHODS\r\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study of 1002 randomly selected patients aged 50-80 years from four university primary care settings in Switzerland. For hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus, we first measured proportions in control, then assessed therapy modifications among those in poor control. \"Appropriate clinical action\" was defined as a therapy modification or return to control without therapy modification within 12 months among patients with baseline poor control. Potential overtreatment of these conditions was defined as intensive treatment among low-risk patients with optimal target values.\r\nRESULTS\r\n20% of patients with hypertension, 41% with dyslipidemia and 36% with diabetes mellitus were in control at baseline. When appropriate clinical action in response to poor control was integrated into measuring quality of care, 52 to 55% had appropriate quality of care. Over 12 months, therapy of 61% of patients with baseline poor control was modified for hypertension, 33% for dyslipidemia, and 85% for diabetes mellitus. Increases in number of drug classes (28-51%) and in drug doses (10-61%) were the most common therapy modifications. Patients with target organ damage and higher baseline values were more likely to have appropriate clinical action. We found low rates of potential overtreatment with 2% for hypertension, 3% for diabetes mellitus and 3-6% for dyslipidemia.\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nIn primary care, evaluating whether physicians respond appropriately to poor risk factor control, in addition to assessing proportions in control, provide a broader view of the quality of care than relying solely on measures of proportions in control. Such measures could be more clinically relevant and acceptable to physicians than simply reporting levels of control.",

Impairments in motor and behavioural function occur frequently, but no information is available concerning the coexistence of deficits in these two developmental domains. This study explored the occurrence of motor and behavioural deficits and their coexistence in children with surgically corrected congenital heart disease.\r\nMETHODS: Outcome was assessed in 95 children with congenital heart disease who had undergone cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Their mean age was 9.6 years (SD 2.5). Motor function was assessed with the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment and behaviour with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire.\r\nRESULTS: Children with congenital heart disease performed poorer in all motor domains compared with the reference population (all p \u2264 0.001). Behaviour was affected in the domains 'emotional symptoms' and 'hyperactivity/inattention' (both p < 0.01), and 54% of the children with motor abnormalities showed behavioural deficits. Children with coexistent abnormalities in behaviour and motor function had higher rates of remedial school services and therapeutic support.\r\nCONCLUSION: Children with congenital heart disease are at risk of long-term motor and behavioural problems, and there is a high rate of coexistence of problems in both domains. Early and longitudinal assessment of all developmental domains is necessary to provide adequate early support.",

We compared various measures of body condition (body mass, body condition score, kidney fat index, bone marrow fat index, adrenal mass, kidney to adrenal mass ratio), diet quality (%browse, protein and fibre content) and rumen papillation in 106 impalas (Aepyceros melampus) from four different locations in Zimbabwe. The various condition proxies indicated that periods of low diet quality are characterised by a high proportion of browse in the diet of this species. Animals with a high proportion of browse had more voluminous rumens, suggesting a compensation for lower diet quality by increased intake. Macroscopic papillation indices did not yield meaningful significant correlations with diet quality or body condition proxies, and hence, their use for estimating habitat or body condition cannot be advocated. In contrast to previous histological reports, ballooning cells of the Stratum corneum of the ruminal mucosa were more prominent in animals on lowerquality diets. There were significant correlations of the kidney to adrenal mass ratio with other body conditions and with diet quality indices, suggesting that poor body condition and low diet quality represent stressful situations.",

Also, with some exceptions, a common denominator is that when the tumor cannot be cured with surgery, the efficacy of current therapies is poor and new treatment modalities are thus needed. We have studied the combination of a capsid-modified oncolytic adenovirus CGTG-102 (Ad5/3-D24-GMCSF) with doxorubicin, with or without ifosfamide, the preferred first-line chemotherapeutic options for most types of STS. We show that CGTG-102 and doxorubicin plus ifosfamide together are able to increase cell killing of Syrian hamster STS cells over single agents, as well as upregulate immunogenic cell death markers. When tested in vivo against established STS tumors in fully immunocompetent Syrian hamsters, the combination was highly effective. CGTG-102 and doxorubicin (without ifosfamide) resulted in synergistic antitumor efficacy against human STS xenografts in comparison with single agent treatments. Doxorubicin increased adenoviral replication in human and hamster STS cells, potentially contributing to the observed therapeutic synergy. In conclusion, the preclinical data generated here support clinical translation of the combination of CGTG-102 and doxorubicin, or doxorubicin plus ifosfamide, for the treatment of STS, and provide clues on the mechanisms of synergy.",

Our aim was to identify and summarise studies assessing associations between physical activity and its determinants and/or outcomes in patients with COPD and to develop a conceptual model for physical activity in COPD.  METHODS  We conducted a systematic search of four databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Psychinfo) prior to November 2012. Teams of two reviewers independently selected articles, extracted data and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess quality of evidence.  RESULTS  86 studies were included: 59 were focused on determinants, 23 on outcomes and 4 on both. Hyperinflation, exercise capacity, dyspnoea, previous exacerbations, gas exchange, systemic inflammation, quality of life and self-efficacy were consistently related to physical activity, but often based on cross-sectional studies and low-quality evidence. Results from studies of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments were inconsistent and the quality of evidence was low to very low. As outcomes, COPD exacerbations and mortality were consistently associated with low levels of physical activity based on moderate quality evidence. Physical activity was associated with other outcomes such as dyspnoea, health-related quality of life, exercise capacity and FEV1 but based on cross-sectional studies and low to very low quality evidence.  CONCLUSIONS  Physical activity level in COPD is consistently associated with mortality and exacerbations, but there is poor evidence about determinants of physical activity, including the impact of treatment.",

The epidemiology of discontinued RCTs, however, remains unclear.  OBJECTIVES  To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and publication history of discontinued RCTs and to investigate factors associated with RCT discontinuation due to poor recruitment and with nonpublication.  DESIGN AND SETTING  Retrospective cohort of RCTs based on archived protocols approved by 6 research ethics committees in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada between 2000 and 2003. We recorded trial characteristics and planned recruitment from included protocols. Last follow-up of RCTs was April 27, 2013.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES  Completion status, reported reasons for discontinuation, and publication status of RCTs as determined by correspondence with the research ethics committees, literature searches, and investigator surveys.  RESULTS  After a median follow-up of 11.6 years (range, 8.8-12.6 years), 253 of 1017 included RCTs were discontinued (24.9% [95% CI, 22.3%-27.6%]). Only 96 of 253 discontinuations (37.9% [95% CI, 32.0%-44.3%]) were reported to ethics committees. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was poor recruitment (101/1017; 9.9% [95% CI, 8.2%-12.0%]). In multivariable analysis, industry sponsorship vs investigator sponsorship (8.4% vs 26.5%; odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.15-0.43]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and a larger planned sample size in increments of 100 (-0.7%; OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.92-1.00]; P\u2009=\u2009.04) were associated with lower rates of discontinuation due to poor recruitment. Discontinued trials were more likely to remain unpublished than completed trials (55.1% vs 33.6%; OR, 3.19 [95% CI, 2.29-4.43]; P\u2009<\u2009.001).  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE  In this sample of trials based on RCT protocols from 6 research ethics committees, discontinuation was common, with poor recruitment being the most frequently reported reason. Greater efforts are needed to ensure the reporting of trial discontinuation to research ethics committees and the publication of results of discontinued trials.",

        "document": "Title: Impact of variable CYP genotypes on breast cancer relapse in patients undergoing adjuvant tamoxifen therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND  Tamoxifen is frequently used for the treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancer (BC). Mainly CYP2D6 is responsible for the transformation to therapeutically active metabolites, but CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2B6 also are involved. We investigated the impact of polymorphisms within the genes encoding these CYP enzymes on the relapse-free time (RFT) in patients with BC.  METHODS  Ninety-nine patients with hormone receptor positive BC, who had undergone adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, were genotyped for seventeen common variants within the genes encoding CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 using TaqMan and PCR-RFLP technology. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to elucidate the impact of genetic variants on RFT. Furthermore, CYP2D6 metabolic activity was determined in a subset of 50 patients by assessing dextromethorphan/dextrorphan urinary excretion ratios. CYP2D6 activity was compared to the CYP2D6 allelic combinations to evaluate the predictive value of the CYP2D6 genotyping results on phenotype.  RESULTS  Although a trend toward longer RFTs in carriers of CYP2D6 allele combinations encoding for extensive and ultrafast metabolizer phenotypes was observed, none of the investigated genetic variants had a statistically significant impact on RFT. The combined analysis of five major CYP2D6 variants was useful for the discrimination between poor and non-poor metabolizers.  CONCLUSIONS  Comprehensive CYP2D6 genotyping has a good predictive value for CYP2D6 activity. Common variants in CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2B6 did not have a significant impact on the RFT in this cohort of patients with BC.",

PAs are more likely to issue an Against recommendation at firms with poor performance and higher levels of CEO pay and do not appear to follow a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach. PAs\u2019 recommendations are the key determinant of voting outcome but the sensitivity of shareholder votes to these recommendations varies with the institutional ownership structure, and the rationale behind the recommendation, suggesting that at least some shareholders do not blindly follow these recommendations. More than half of the firms respond to the adverse shareholder vote triggered by a negative recommendation by engaging with investors and making changes to their compensation plan. However, we find no market reaction to the announcement of such changes, even when material enough to result in a favorable recommendation and vote the following year. Our findings suggest that, rather than identifying and promoting superior compensation practices, PAs' key economic role is processing a substantial amount of executive pay information on behalf of institutional investors, hence reducing their cost of making informed voting decisions. Our findings contribute to the literature on shareholder voting and the related policy debate.",

We investigated 24 species of captive ruminants from one facility for which quantitative feeding instructions and necropsy reports between 1991 and 2012 were available. Species were classified as grazer (GR), intermediate feeder (IM), or browser (BR). Feeding type and body mass were significantly correlated to the diet fed, with smaller and BR species receiving higher proportions of non\u2010roughage diet items. There were no significant differences between feeding types in the occurrence of parakeratosis/ruminitis acidosis (PRA) at necropsy, but in body condition score, with BR more often in poor and less often in excellent body condition at necropsy. While there was no direct correlation between the proportion of nonroughage diet items and PRA across species, there was a significant effect of the proportion of non\u2010roughage diet items on PRA when body mass was also taken into account: larger species, and those that received more non\u2010roughage diet items, had higher prevalence of PRA. The results underline that diet and lack of structured feed items can be associated with the disease complex of acidosis in ruminants, but also suggest that this is modified by factors related to animal size. These latter may include susceptibility to acidosis, or husbandry\u2010related opportunities to monopolize non\u2010roughage feeds and ingest higher proportions than intended by feeding instructions.",

Although a reform of the current system is necessary to achieve financial sustainability, delaying its implementation implies large welfare gains for the (poorer) current generations, imposing only small costs on (richer) future generations. In contrast, a fully funded reform harms current generations, with small gains to future generations.",

I propose a quantitative life-cycle model with college enrolment. Altruistic parents provide financial support to their children. Using counterfactual experiments, I find that 24 percent of all households are financially constrained in their college decision. Constraints become more severe over time. I show that my model is consistent with a narrow college enrolment gap between students from rich and poor families, as previously reported in the empirical literature. The estimation of enrolment gaps is a popular reduced-form approach for measuring the fraction of constrained households. My results suggest that these reduced-form estimates are misleading, and that a structural model of parental transfers is needed to correctly identify constrained households. Further, I show that parental transfers are an important driver behind the changing role of family income as a determinant of college entry, a fact that is well documented for the US economy.",

Here, we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that poverty may have particular psychological consequences that can lead to economic behaviors that make it difficult to escape poverty. The evidence indicates that poverty causes stress and negative affective states which in turn may lead to short-sighted and risk-averse decision-making, possibly by limiting attention and favoring habitual behaviors at the expense of goal-directed ones. Together, these relationships may constitute a feedback loop that contributes to the perpetuation of poverty. We conclude by pointing toward specific gaps in our knowledge and outlining poverty alleviation programs that this mechanism suggests.",

So far, no curative option apart from allogeneic stem cell transplantation is available. Large cell transformation often hallmarks cases with a more aggressive clinical course, and large tumor cells may express CD30. Recently, brentuximab vedotin, a conjugate of an anti-CD30 antibody and monomethylauristatin E, which inhibits the polymerization of microtubuli, has produced promising results in phase 2 trials in CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\r\nObservations: We describe 4 patients with advanced CTCL, 3 with MF and 1 with S\u00e9zary syndrome, who were treated with brentuximab. All patients had received multiple previous systemic therapies. In 2 cases of MF, a remission enabling subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation was achieved.\r\nConclusions and Relevance: rentuximab is a well-tolerated, promising new treatment option for advanced CTCL that can be integrated in an allogeneic stem cell transplantation plan by selectively depleting malignant CD30+ cutaneous lymphoma cells.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS  We analyzed 61 children (30 female) under 18 years of age (mean age 9.9, range 1 month-17 years) operated between 2000 and 2010. Medical records were evaluated retrospectively; postoperative histologic diagnoses included 20 craniopharyngiomas, 17 gliomas, 6 pituitary adenomas and 18 rare tumor entities.  RESULTS  Of 61 patients, 58 (95%) were still alive at last follow-up. Three patients died, all due to progression of malignant rhabdoid tumors. Postoperative clinical morbidity consisted of endocrinological (66%), visual (60.7%) and other neurological deficits (55.9%) after a mean follow-up of 44 months. When compared to all other tumor entities in this series, craniopharyngiomas were associated with high rates of gross-total resection (p=0.008), frequent progression of residual tumor (p=0.005) scotomas (p=0.013), persistent diabetes insipidus (p<0.001), and panhypopituitarism (p<0.001). Surgically treated gliomas showed higher rates of motor weakness (p=0.004), double vision (p<0.001), and milder forms of endocrinopathy (single hormone deficits, p=0.02). In general, deterioration in school performance was associated with multiple surgeries (p=0.018) and radiotherapy (p=0.021).  CONCLUSION  Excellent overall survival in these patients is possible, however malignant rhabdoid tumors have a poor prognosis. Aggressive treatment is associated with significant morbidity. Children operated for craniopharyngioma showed an expected high rate of endocrine deterioration, whereas glioma patients had higher incidences of motor weakness and double vision. The treating physicians should be well aware of all these considerable postoperative deficits, especially when facing interdisciplinary management decisions, and for the informed consent discussions with the patient and the parents.",

Here we investigated whether excessive reliance on visual input for spatial orientation (visual dependence) was associated with long term vestibular symptoms following acute VN. Twenty-eight patients with VN and 25 normal control subjects were included. Patients were enrolled at least 6 months after acute illness. Recovery status was not a criterion for study entry, allowing recruitment of patients with a full range of persistent symptoms. We measured visual dependence with a laptop-based Rod-and-Disk Test and severity of symptoms with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). The third of patients showing the worst clinical outcomes (mean DHI score 36-80) had significantly greater visual dependence than normal subjects (6.35\u00b0 error vs. 3.39\u00b0 respectively, p\u200a=\u200a0.03). Asymptomatic patients and those with minor residual symptoms did not differ from controls. Visual dependence was associated with high levels of persistent vestibular symptoms after acute VN. Over-reliance on visual information for spatial orientation is one characteristic of poorly recovered vestibular neuritis patients. The finding may be clinically useful given that visual dependence may be modified through rehabilitation desensitization techniques.",

METHODS    A total of 125 mothers and 106 fathers of 125 children with active and inactive IBD from the Swiss IBD multicentre cohort study were included. Parental mental health was assessed by the Symptom Checklist 27 and child behaviour problems by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Child medical data were extracted from hospital records.    RESULTS    While the mothers reported lower mental health, the fathers' mental health was similar, or even better, than in age-matched and gender-matched community controls. In both parents, shorter time since the child's diagnosis was associated with poorer mental health. In addition, the presence of their own IBD diagnosis and child behaviour problems predicted maternal mental health problems.    CONCLUSIONS    Parents of children with IBD may need professional support when their child is diagnosed, to mitigate distress. This, in turn, may help the child to adjust better to IBD. Particular attention should be paid to mothers who have their own IBD diagnosis and whose children display behaviour problems.",

Our study gives a point prevalence estimate of depression in young Swiss men, and describes the association between depression and education, material and social resources, and job/school satisfaction.  METHODS: We used data from the cross-sectional Swiss Federal Surveys of Adolescents (ch-x) from 2010 to 2011 comprising 9,066 males aged between 18 and 25 years. Depression was assessed by means of self-reports using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Persons were categorised into three groups: depression, subthreshold depression, and no depression. We assessed the relationship between depression and education, material and social resources, and satisfaction with job/school. Differences according to depression status were tested with chi-square tests for categorical variables and one-way analyses of variance for continuous variables.  RESULTS: Point prevalence of depression (3.60%) and subthreshold depression (3.62%) was high. Poor mental health was associated with lower education in young adults (p <0.001), and with their parents\u2019 education (p = 0.024). Social resources in persons with depression and subthreshold depression were substantially reduced (i.e., social support and satisfaction with social relations; both p <0.001). Young men with depression and subthreshold depression also reported a current lack of satisfaction with job/school (p <0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of (subthreshold) depression is high in young Swiss men. Depression at this age might result in a bad long-term prognosis owing to its association with low satisfaction with job/school and low self-efficacy. Interventions should especially consider the lower social resources of young men with depression.",

Intraoral photographs and dental impressions were taken and irregularity index was determined and compared to the values of the immediate post-therapeutic values; failures of retainers were also recorded and analysed.\r\nRESULTS: The mean observed retention time was 7 years and 5 months. Irregularity index: Changes occurring during retention were statistically different between the lateral incisors bonded to retainers and the canines not bonded to retainers. Only six patients showed changes in irregularity index of the lateral incisors in spite of a retainer in place. Periodontal health: The median value of the GI for all teeth bonded to upper retainers was 1.10 and the median value of the plaque index (PI) was 1.14. PI was not a significant predictor of GI. The overall BOP of the bonded teeth to the retainer for each participant was 22.3 per cent. Failure rate: Twenty-eight out of 41 patients experienced no failure of the upper bonded retainer (68.3 per cent). Detachments were the most frequent incidents.\r\nCONCLUSION: Although plaque accumulation might be increased in patients with already poor oral hygiene, maxillary bonded retainers caused no significant negative effects on the periodontal health.",

        "document": "Title: Catastrophizing-a prognostic factor for outcome in patients with low back pain: a systematic review\nAbstract: BACKGROUND CONTEXT  Psychological factors including catastrophizing thoughts are believed to influence the development of chronic low back pain (LBP).  PURPOSE  To assess the prognostic importance of catastrophizing as a coping strategy in patients with LBP.  STUDY DESIGN  This is a systematic review.  PATIENT SAMPLE  This study included patients with LBP.  OUTCOME MEASURES  Work-related outcomes and perceived measures including return to work, pain, and disability.  METHODS  In September 2012, the following databases were searched: BIOSIS, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, OTSeeker, PeDRO, PsycInfo, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science. To ensure completeness of the search, a hand search and a search of bibliographies were conducted and all relevant references included. All observational studies investigating the prognostic value of catastrophizing in patients with LBP were eligible. Included were studies with 100 and more patients and follow-up of at least 3 months. Excluded were studies with poor methodological quality, short follow-up duration, and small sample size.  RESULTS  A total of 1,473 references were retrieved, and 706 references remained after the removal of duplicates. For 77 references, the full text was assessed and 19 publications based on 16 studies were included. Of four studies that investigated work-related outcomes, two found catastrophizing to be associated with work status. Most studies that investigated self-reported outcome measures (n=8, 66%) found catastrophizing to be associated with pain and disability at follow-up in acute, subacute, and chronic LBP patients. In most studies that applied cutoff values, patients identified as high catastrophizers experienced a worse outcome compared with low catastrophizers (n=5, 83%).  CONCLUSIONS  There is some evidence that catastrophizing as a coping strategy might lead to delayed recovery. The influence of catastrophizing in patients with LBP is not fully established and should be further investigated. Of particular importance is the establishment of cutoff levels for identifying patients at risk.",

Upon ruling out cardiovascular disease, only vague recommendations exist for further treatment.  OBJECTIVES  To summarize treatment efficacy for patients presenting with NCCP.  METHODS  Systematic review and meta-analysis. In July 2013, Medline, Web of Knowledge, Embase, EBSCOhost, Cochrane Reviews and Trials, and Scopus were searched. Hand and bibliography searches were also conducted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating non-surgical treatments in patients with NCCP were included. Exclusion criteria were poor study quality and small sample size (<10 patients per group).  RESULTS  Thirty eligible RCT's were included. Most studies assessed PPI efficacy for gastroesophageal reflux disorders (GERD, n\u200a=\u200a10). Two RCTs included musculoskeletal chest pain, seven psychotropic drugs, and eleven various psychological interventions. Study quality was high in five RCTs and acceptable in 25. PPI treatment in patients with GERD (5 RCTs, 192 patients) was more effective than placebo [pooled OR 11.7 (95% CI 5.5 to 25.0, heterogeneity I2\u200a=\u200a6.1%)]. The pooled OR in GERD negative patients (4 RCTs, 156 patients) was 0.8 (95% CI 0.2 to 2.8, heterogeneity I2\u200a=\u200a50.4%). In musculoskeletal NCCP (2 RCTs, 229 patients) manual therapy was more effective than usual care but not than home exercise [pooled mean difference 0.5 (95% CI -0.3 to 1.3, heterogeneity I2\u200a=\u200a46.2%)]. The findings for cognitive behavioral treatment, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants were mixed. Most evidence was available for cognitive behavioral treatment interventions.  LIMITATIONS  Only a small number of studies were available.  CONCLUSIONS  Timely diagnostic evaluation and treatment of the disease underlying NCCP is important. For patients with suspected GERD, high-dose treatment with PPI is effective. Only limited evidence was available for most prevalent diseases manifesting with chest pain. In patients with idiopathic NCCP, treatments based on cognitive behavioral principles might be considered.",

        "document": "Title: Small dense low density lipoprotein particles are associated with poor outcome after angioplasty in peripheral artery disease\nAbstract: PURPOSE In patients suffering from symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD), percutaneous revascularization is the treatment of choice. However, restenosis may occur in 10 to 60% in the first year depending on a variety of factors. Small dense low density lipoprotein (sdLDL) particles are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, but their role in the process of restenosis is not known. We conducted a prospective study to analyze the association of sdLDL particles with the outcome of balloon angioplasty in PAD. The composite primary endpoint was defined as improved walking distance and absence of restenosis.\r\nMETHODS Patients with angiographically documented PAD of the lower extremities who were scheduled for lower limb revascularization were consecutively recruited for the study. At baseline and at three month follow-up triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL size and subclasses and HDL cholesterol and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were measured. Three months after the intervention duplex sonography was performed to detect restenosis.\r\nRESULTS Sixty-four patients (53% male) with a mean age of 68.6\u00b19.9 years were included. The proportion of small- dense LDL particles (class III and IV) was significantly lower (33.1\u00b111.0% vs. 39.4\u00b112.1%, p\u200a=\u200a0.038) in patients who reached the primary end-point compared with those who did not. Patients with improved walking distance and without restenosis had a significantly higher LDL size at baseline (26.6\u00b11.1 nm vs. 26.1\u00b11.1 nm, p\u200a=\u200a0.046) and at follow-up (26.7\u00b11.1 nm vs. 26.2\u00b10.9 nm, p\u200a=\u200a0.044) than patients without improvement.\r\nCONCLUSIONS Small-dense LDL particles are associated with worse early outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous revascularization for symptomatic PAD.",

To evaluate its actual impact we studied response-related treatment and outcomes.\r\nPROCEDURE: Patients with IRSG-III RME <21 years and non-response (NR, <33% volume reduction) in five consecutive CWS-trials were analysed and compared with partial responders (PAR, \u226533% reduction). The NR was reviewed and sub-classified as Objective Response (OR, <0%-33% reduction) or Stable/Progressive Disease (SPD).\r\nRESULTS: Fifty-nine of 529 patients had NR (n\u2009=\u200934 OR, n\u2009=\u200925 SPD). Primary risk-factors including age, tumour size, and TN-classification did not differ between NR and PAR groups but NR had more patients with unfavourable sites comparatively (P\u2009=\u20090.04). There were no differences in primary risk-factors between OR and SPD. Significant factors associated with poor outcome in multivariate analysis were NR, TN-classification, age >10 years, tumour size >5\u2009cm and therapy in older trials. After response assessment n\u2009=\u200924 NR continued to receive induction chemotherapy, n\u2009=\u200932 received other combinations and n\u2009=\u20093 no further chemotherapy. Forty-two non-responders were irradiated, and the tumours were completely resected in n\u2009=\u200920. After a median follow-up of 8 years, 34 NR are alive. Seventeen of 21 failures leading to disease-related deaths were locoregional. The five-year overall survival rate (OS) was 76\u2009\u00b1\u20094% for PAR, 79\u2009\u00b1\u200914% for OR, but only 40\u2009\u00b1\u200919% for SPD (P\u2009<\u20090.001).\r\nCONCLUSION: Response to induction chemotherapy appears to be an important surrogate marker of poor outcome in patients with SPD largely due to ineffective local control.

Little is known about the possible predictors of the overlap syndrome and its association with comorbidities contributing to impaired outcome. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and possible predictors of the overlap syndrome and its association with comorbidities in a cohort of COPD patients. Methods: Individuals with COPD (GOLD stages I-IV, risk groups A-D) were recruited from outpatient clinics. Information on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), COPD assessment test, comorbidities, medications and exacerbations in the past year was collected and a spirometry was performed. Participants underwent a nocturnal polygraphy using the ApneaLink\u2122 device at home. An apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >10 per hour was considered to indicate OSA. Results: We enrolled 177 COPD patients (112 men) with a mean age of 64 years (range 42-90), of whom 35 (20%) had an ESS score above 10. During nocturnal polygraphy, 33 patients (19%) had evidence of OSA. In multivariate analysis, BMI and pack years were positively associated with AHI, independent of other significant AHI determinants from univariate analysis. Arterial hypertension and diabetes were more common in patients with the overlap syndrome. Conclusions: Almost 20% of COPD patients also have OSA. BMI and smoking history seem to be predictors of the overlap syndrome, and these patients may be more often affected by hypertension and diabetes. \u00a9 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

DESIGN  Cross-sectional data collection within the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury Cohort.  SETTING  Community setting.  PARTICIPANTS  Persons with SCI (N=516) who are \u2265 16 years old and living in the community in Switzerland.  INTERVENTIONS  Not applicable.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Participation was measured with the restrictions subscale of the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation, General SE with the General Self-Efficacy Scale, PIL with the Purpose in Life Test-Short Form, appraisals with the Appraisal of Life Events Scale, and coping with the Brief COPE.  RESULTS  General SE (r=.32) and PIL (r=.23) were associated with less participation restrictions. The initial model yielded a poor model fit. The modified final model had an acceptable fit (\u03c7(2)11=36.2; P<.01; root mean square error of approximation=.067 [90% confidence interval: .045-.09]; comparative fit index=.98). A total of 15% of the variance of participation was explained. In the final model, general SE had a moderate direct effect (\u03b2=.24) and mediated effects via threat appraisal and challenge appraisal and humor on participation, indicating a partial mediation effect. The association between PIL and participation was indirect: challenge appraisal and humor acted as mediators.  CONCLUSIONS  The results only partly support the double-mediating effect as suggested in the SCI adjustment model because both direct and indirect effects on participation were observed. Individuals with higher general SE and PIL perceive less participation restrictions. General SE seems an appropriate target to enhance participation. Longitudinal studies are needed to support our findings.",

Among psychological factors, anxiety may affect HIV-infected persons in all stages of disease, from the disclosure of HIV diagnosis to the decision to start and maintain treatment. This is a lifelong challenge for both patients and doctors. Psychiatric comorbidities (depression, addiction) may enhance negative psychological effects of HIV. Among social factors, stigma and discrimination may occur in families and at work, leading to a loss of social support resulting in isolation and poverty. This may prevent HIV-positive individuals from seeking medical care. These aspects are particularly important in some groups of patients as injecting drug users and migrants. Acknowledgment and consideration of psychosocial factors are therefore essential for the long term success of antiretroviral therapy.",

India, however, refers to its limited capacity and wide-spread energy poverty. Is India hiding behind its poor? While others examined the distribution of emissions within the country to answer this question, we study domestic policy making at the examples of energy subsidies and access to clean energy. Evidence from a combination of interviews and secondary sources suggests that domestic policy making is not generally inconsistent with the pro-poor arguments advanced at the international level. Given their large number and the country\u2019s democratic system, the poor do have some weight in Indian politics. However, inconsistencies can be identified within India\u2019s international discourse that simultaneously tries to project an image of a strong emerging economy, and of a poor developing country in need of special treatment. We show that this branding strategy is problematic both for the progress of international climate negotiations and for India\u2019s poor.",

This study therefore aims to explore possible differences in the prevalence of WLC and its association with health outcomes between white- and blue-collar workers from different work environments in Switzerland. Cross-sectional survey data collected in 2007 in the service sector and in 2010 in the industrial sector were used for statistical analyses. A subsample of university graduates employed by large service companies (N\u2009=\u20091,170) from the first survey's population was taken and compared with a subsample of low or unskilled industrial and construction workers with no or only compulsory education (N\u2009=\u2009489) from the second survey's population. The results show almost consistently, and particularly in women, a lower prevalence of time- and strain-based forms and both causal directions of WLC in blue-collar workers. However, associations between different WLC measures and general, physical and mental health outcomes were found to be equally strong or even stronger among blue-collar workers compared to white-collar workers. Low or unskilled industrial and construction workers are less frequently affected by higher degrees of WLC but are then at no lower risk of suffering poor self-rated health or severe backaches and sleep disorders than university graduates working in the service sector with comparable exposure to WLC. In conclusion, it can be stated that WLC turned out to be much less prevalent but equally or even more detrimental to health in blue-collar workers, who therefore need to be considered in future studies.",

Nationally representative cross-sectional data from the Swiss Health Survey of 2007 were used for this study. Bi- and multivariate statistical analyses were carried out on a sample of 6950 adult employees of working age. We examined a comprehensive set of five health behaviours and lifestyle factors as well as twelve physical and psychosocial work factors as potential mediators of the relationship between social status and SRH. Analyses were stratified by sex and performed using two measures of social status, educational level and occupational position. Strong social gradients were found for SRH, but mainly in men whereas in women the associations were either not linear (educational level) or not statistically significant (occupational position). Social gradients were also found for most lifestyle and all physical and psychosocial work factors studied. These three groups of factors equally contributed to and largely accounted for the social gradients in SRH although not all of the individual factors turned out to be independent and significant risk factors for poor SRH. Such risk factors included physical inactivity and obesity, poor posture and no or low social support at work (both sexes), heavy smoking (men) and underweight, overweight, uniform arm or hand movements at work, monotonous work and job insecurity (women). In conclusion, social inequalities (or more precisely educational and occupational status differences) in SRH were more pronounced in men and can be attributed for the most part to a sedentary lifestyle and to a physically demanding and socially unsupportive and insecure work environment. Apart from this main finding and overall pattern, sex-specific risk profiles were observed with regard to SRH and need to be taken into consideration.",

The effects of patients' inhalation compliance and of laboratory data during the initial PCP on subsequent PCP relapses were assessed. After a median of 8 months (range, 2-21.5 months) on pentamidine prophylaxis, 13 patients suffered a PCP relapse. Six of them had missed at least one inhalation within the last month before the relapse. Two of these six relapses were fatal. The relapse occurrence was significantly associated with the percentage of missed inhalations. Additional significant associations were found between relapses, low levels of T4 lymphocytes, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase during the initial PCP episode (29 patients). Mean levels of T4 lymphocytes were 27/mm3 and 47/mm3 in patients with and without subsequent relapses, mean levels of lactate dehydrogenase were 692 U/L and 605 U/L, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression did not reveal further differences between patients with and without relapses. The increased relapse risk associated with poor inhalation compliance stresses the need for appropriate guidance and motivation of the patients.",

Study results suggest that in chronic pain patients, an improvement in sleep quality critically influences the outcomes of interventions on mood and pain. Yet, only a few studies have systematically sought to evaluate the sleep quality of TMD/OFP patients. Standardized and validated self-reported instruments designed for screening sleep disturbances or for the evaluation of treatment outcomes in this population would therefore enhance evidence and improve treatment options. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to review the self-reported instruments that measure sleep dysfunction in studies on TMD/OFP patients, by conducting a systematic literature search; (2) to evaluate their clinimetric evidence; and (3) to provide guidance for future research using such instruments. A total of 26 papers, using eight different instruments, were identified. The most frequently used questionnaires and the only ones with good clinimetric properties were the Insomnia Severity Index followed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. They were most reliable, valid and time-effective for measuring sleep dysfunctions in patients with TMD/OFP, with only a few practical constraints. Yet, in future studies, an assessment of the relationship between sleep disturbances and chronic pain will have to include instruments measuring the effect of mediator variables such as cognitive or emotional arousal. Research is required to clarify if existing self-reported questionnaires measuring these aspects will promote further insights or if there is a need for new instruments. This future research direction would blend into the overall biopsychosocial concept of TMD/OFP diagnoses and treatment.",

Its prognostic utility in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) is yet to be fully elucidated.\r\nMETHODS: A cohort of patients undergoing RC for UCB in a tertiary referral centre between 1992 and 2012 was analysed. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was computed using complete blood counts performed pre-RC, or before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy where applicable. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the optimal cutoff point for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). The predictive ability of NLR was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. The likelihood-ratio test was used to determine whether multivariable models were improved by including NLR.\r\nRESULTS: The cohort included 424 patients followed for a median of 58.4 months. An NLR of 3 was determined as the optimal cutoff value. Patients with an NLR\u2a7e3.0 had significantly worse survival outcomes (5y-RFS: 53% vs 64%, log-rank P=0.013; 5y-CSS: 57% vs 75%, log-rank P<0.001; 5y-OS: 43% vs 64%, log-rank P<0.001). After adjusting for disease-specific predictors, an NLR \u2a7e3.0 was significantly associated with worse RFS (HR=1.49; 95% CI=1.12-2.0, P=0.007), CSS (HR=1.88; 95% CI=1.39-2.54, P<0.001) and OS (average HR=1.67; 95% CI=1.17-2.39, P=0.005). The likelihood-ratio test confirmed that prognostic models were improved by including NLR.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an inexpensive prognostic biomarker for patients undergoing RC for UCB. It offers pre-treatment prognostic value in addition to established prognosticators and may be helpful in guiding treatment decisions.",

An elevated platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a marker of inflammation, has been linked to poor prognosis in several malignancies. Here, we quantify the prognostic impact of this biomarker.\r\nMETHODS: A systematic review of databases was conducted to identify publications exploring the association of blood PLR and overall survival (OS) in solid tumors. Data were pooled in a meta-analysis. Pooled HRs for OS by disease group and by PLR cutoff groups were computed and weighted using generic inverse-variance and random-effect modeling.\r\nRESULTS: Twenty studies comprising 12,754 patients were assessed. Cutoffs for PLR defining risk groups ranged from 150 to 300 and were dichotomous (12 studies; group 1) or split into three groups (<150/150-300/>300, 8 studies; group 2). Higher PLR was associated with significantly worse OS in group 1 [HR = 1.87; 95% confidence interval (CI, 1.49-2.34); P < 0.001] and with a nonsignificant association in group 2 (HR per higher category = 1.21; 95%CI, 0.97-1.50; P = 0.10). The size of effect of PLR on OS was greater for metastatic disease (HR[group 1] = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6-2.7; HR[group 2] = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4) than for early-stage disease (HR[group 1] = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.2; HR[group 2] = 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3). A significant association was observed for colorectal, hepatocellular, gastroesophageal, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinoma in group 1 and for colorectal cancers in group 2.\r\nCONCLUSION: A high PLR is associated with worse OS in various solid tumors. Further research of its regulation and relevance in daily practice is warranted.\r\nIMPACT: PLR is a readily available and inexpensive biomarker with independent prognostic value in solid tumors.",

There are currently few case studies that have documented the functional outcome in PNPO deficiency, which remains poor in the majority of cases. We present the case of a male infant born at 35 weeks gestation who promptly responded to oral administration of PLP, following resistance to common anticonvulsive therapy and to a pyridoxine trial. Neurological outcome at 21 months is favorable and illustrates the importance of standardized vitamin trials in the acute setting of \"therapy-resistant\" neonatal seizures. Early recognition of PNPO deficiency and appropriate intervention might be associated with a more favorable outcome than initially considered.",

The mechanisms by which microRNA-9 contributes to medulloblastoma pathogenesis remain unclear, and factors that regulate this process have not been delineated.\r\nMETHODS: Expression and methylation status of microRNA-9 in medulloblastoma cell lines and primary samples were analysed. The association of microRNA-9 expression with medulloblastoma patients' clinical outcome was assessed, and the impact of microRNA-9 restoration was functionally validated in medulloblastoma cells.\r\nRESULTS: microRNA-9 expression is repressed in a large subset of MB samples compared with normal fetal cerebellum. Low microRNA-9 expression correlates significantly with the diagnosis of unfavourable histopathological variants and with poor clinical outcome. microRNA-9 silencing occurs via cancer-specific CpG island hypermethylation. HES1 was identified as a direct target of microRNA-9 in medulloblastoma, and restoration of microRNA-9 was shown to trigger cell cycle arrest, to inhibit clonal growth and to promote medulloblastoma cell differentiation.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: microRNA-9 is a methylation-silenced tumour suppressor that could be a potential candidate predictive marker for poor prognosis of medulloblastoma. Loss of microRNA-9 may confer a proliferative advantage to tumour cells, and it could possibly contribute to disease pathogenesis. Thus, re-expression of microRNA-9 may constitute a novel epigenetic regulation strategy against medulloblastoma.",

We report results of a time-dependent multivariable analysis of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) (n=337) versus chemotherapy (n=271) or autologous HSCT (autoHSCT) (n=152) in 760 patients aged 40-60 years with AML in CR1. Patients receiving alloHSCT showed improved overall survival (OS) as compared with chemotherapy (respectively, 57\u00b13% vs 40\u00b13% at 5 years, P<0.001). Comparable OS was observed following alloHSCT and autoHSCT in patients with intermediate-risk AML (60\u00b14 vs 54\u00b15%). However, alloHSCT was associated with less relapse (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, P<0.001) and better relapse-free survival (RFS) (HR 0.74, P=0.029) as compared with autoHSCT in intermediate-risk AMLs. AlloHSCT was applied following myeloablative conditioning (n=157) or reduced intensity conditioning (n=180), resulting in less NRM, but comparable outcome with respect to OS, RFS and relapse. Collectively, these results show that alloHSCT is to be preferred over chemotherapy as PRT in patients with intermediate- and poor-risk AML aged 40-60 years, whereas autoHSCT remains a treatment option to be considered in patients with intermediate-risk AML.Leukemia advance online publication, 23 December 2014; doi:10.1038/leu.2014.332.",

Firms undertake either product innovations that introduce new luxury goods for the rich; or process innovations that transform existing luxuries into mass products for the poor. A prototypical example for such a product cycle is the automobile. Initially, an exclusive product for the very rich, the automobile became affordable to the middle class after the introduction of Ford's Model T, \u201cthe car that put America on wheels\u201d. We present a model of non-homothetic preferences, in which the rich consume a wide range of exclusive high-quality products and the poor a more narrow range of low-quality mass products. In this framework, inequality affects the composition of R&D through price and market size effects. The inequality\u2013growth relationship depends on how mass production affects productivity; and on the particular dimension of inequality (income gaps versus income concentration). Our model is sufficiently tractable to incorporate learning-by-doing, oligopolistic market structures, and different sources of knowledge spillovers.",

        "document": "Title: Metropolitan governance and territorial inequalities: an assessment of the Social Stratification and Government Inequality thesis in Switzerland\nAbstract: The relationship between institutional fragmentation of urban regions and inequality in government service levels is subject to a long-running debate. On the one hand, neo-progressive reformers argue that fragmented municipal institutions produce a systematic mismatch between fiscal resources and public needs and thereby perpetuate income inequality. On the other hand, public choice scholars hold that polycentric government is more responsive to residents\u2019 needs, and that issues of income distribution can be addressed by intergovernmental coordination. However, the role of this multi-level intergovernmental compound of metropolitan governance in tackling territorial inequalities remains unclear. This paper aims to contribute to the further development of this debate, by drawing on a comprehensive analysis of social policy efforts at the municipal level in the seven largest metropolitan areas in Switzerland. We explore the effect of social segregation, municipal resources, residents\u2019 political preferences, as well as intergovernmental grants on per capita social expenditures in metropolitan municipalities. The results show that, while multi-level intergovernmental cooperation and fiscal equalization between rich and poor municipalities do play a moderating role, institutional fragmentation is an obstacle to matching fiscal resources with social policy needs. In the fragmented setting of the Swiss metropolis, social policies at the municipal level appear as an act of political voluntarism by the rich, rather than as a matter of redistribution oriented by principles of social justice.",

However, the role of fathers in this process has been underinvestigated. Furthermore, many researchers have not tested moderation effects. We extended the literature by investigating maternal and paternal transmission of harsh parenting beliefs to their children 23 years later. Furthermore, we examined the moderating role of interaction quality and included gender and socioeconomic status as control variables. Our data were collected in a unique longitudinal study of 128 families across 23 years. We found high positive associations between the harsh parenting beliefs of parents and their adult children, but only the mother\u2013child transmissions were moderated by interaction quality. Mothers pass on low levels as well as high levels of harsh parenting beliefs to their children if their interaction quality is poor. These findings highlight the importance of investigating intergenerational transmission in both mother\u2013child and father\u2013child dyads.",

Effective anti-inflammatory therapy seems to decrease this risk. Main risk factors for colitis-associated CRC are pancolitis, duration of colitis and presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis. In contrast to sporadic CRC, a characteristic adenoma-carcinoma sequence in the pathogenesis of colitis-associated CRC cannot be found. Nevertheless, numerous cell and gene defects occur. Reactive oxygen species also seem to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of colitis-associated CRC.

Based on the review of the equity and cost-effectiveness literature and relevant policy documents, we identify three potential indicators for equity (vulnerability level, poverty, equal funding per capita), and three indicators for cost-effectiveness (economic savings in absolute and relative terms, human lives saved). Applying these simple indicators to information provided in all 39 project documents considered by the Adaptation Fund Board (AFB) in 2011, we find that projects approved or endorsed by the AFB rank high according to one cost-effectiveness indicator (absolute economic savings), while they rather rank low according to all equity and further cost-effectiveness indicators. Furthermore, we analyze whether equity and cost-effectiveness are two contradicting goals, or whether ways can be found to reconcile both goals in multilateral adaptation finance. We conclude from both the theory and the 39 analyzed project documents that a pure economic definition of cost-effectiveness tends to be in contradiction with equity but that trade-offs between equity and cost-effectiveness can be limited if relative economic savings or human live savings are used as indicator for cost-effectiveness.",

The exposure of interest was ACE inhibitors prior to the onset of SRC. The outcomes of interest were death or dialysis during the first year after the onset of SRC.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 87 subjects with incident SRC were identified and 1-year follow-up data were obtained in 75 (86%) subjects. Overall, 27 (36%) subjects died within the first year and an additional 19 (25%) remained on dialysis 1 year after the onset of SRC. In adjusted analyses, exposure to ACE inhibitors prior to the onset of SRC was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio 2.42, 95% CI 1.02, 5.75, p < 0.05 in the primary analysis and 2.17, 95% CI 0.88, 5.33, p = 0.09 after post-hoc adjustment for pre-existing hypertension).\r\nCONCLUSION: Overall, the 1-year outcomes of SRC were poor. Prior exposure to ACE inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of death after the onset of SRC, although there was uncertainty around the magnitude of the risk and the possibility of residual confounding could not be ruled out. Further studies will be needed to confirm these findings.",

To induce different mood states in sheep housing conditions were varied. Fourteen ewes were group-housed in an unpredictable, stimulus-poor and 15 ewes in a predictable, stimulus-rich environment. Sheep were tested individually for mood in a behavioural cognitive bias paradigm. Also, their reactions to three physical stimuli thought to differ in their perceived valence were observed (negative: pricking, intermediate: slight pressure, positive: kneading). General behaviour, activity, ear movements and positions, and haemodynamic changes in the cortical brain were recorded during stimulations. Generalised mixed-effects models and model probabilities based on the BIC (Bayesian information criterion) were used. Only weak evidence for mood difference was found. Sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor housing condition had a somewhat more negative cognitive bias, showed slightly more aversive behaviour, were slightly more active and moved their ears somewhat more. Sheep most clearly differentiated the negative from the intermediate and positive stimulus in that they exhibited more aversive behaviour, less nibbling, were more active, showed more ear movements, more forward ear postures, fewer backward ear postures, and a stronger decrease in deoxyhaemoglobin when subjected to the negative stimulus. In conclusion, sheep reacted towards stimuli according to their presumed valence but their mood was not strongly influenced by housing conditions. Therefore, behavioural reactions and cortical brain activity towards the stimuli were hardly modulated by housing conditions.",

Yet, despite numerous recent public and private initiatives to develop capacities  for agricultural innovation, such in itiatives are often not well aligned with national efforts to revive existing Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS). In an effort to improve coordination and responsiveness of Capacity Development (CD) initiatives, the G20 Agriculture Ministers requested the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to lead the development of a Tropical Agricultural Platform (TAP), which is designed to improve coherence and coordination of CD for agricultural innovation in the tropics. This paper presents a summary of the results obtained from three regional needs assessments undertaken by TAP and its partners. The surveyed tropical  regions were Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. The findings reveal a mismatch in all three regions between the external supply of primarily individual CD and the actual demand for institutional CD.  The misalignment might be addressed by strengthening south-south and triangular collaboration and by improving the institutional capacities that would render national AIS more demand-oriented and responsive to the needs of mallholders in domestic agriculture.",

Sustainable planning is of great importance to ensure that the necessary resources are available for future generations. However, research has suggested that South African planners do not have the necessary level of map literacy and that new geovisualizations may be required. The goal of this paper is to present preliminary results of comparative experiments to evaluate map literacy of planners in 2D maps and 3D models in South Africa. In these experiments, participants performed equally well when exposed to 2D maps and 3D models. These preliminary results were used to inform the conceptual design of an experiment to evaluate map literacy of users with 2D maps and 3D models. The new experiment was developed using a mixed factorial design and aims to address the challenges identified in the preliminary results. The implementation and execution of the new experiment design will contribute to understanding the strengths and limitations of 3D geovisualization for planning in South Africa. Results will inform guidelines for the appropriate use of these non-traditional technologies for development planning.",

However, quantitative studies of stigma-related emotional and cognitive reactions to involuntary hospitalization and their impact on people with mental illness are scarce. Among 186 individuals with serious mental illness and a history of recent involuntary hospitalization, shame and self-contempt as emotional reactions to involuntary hospitalization, the cognitive appraisal of stigma as a stressor, self-stigma, empowerment as well as quality of life and self-esteem were assessed by self-report. Psychiatric symptoms were rated by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. In multiple linear regressions, more self-stigma was predicted independently by higher levels of shame, self-contempt and stigma stress. A greater sense of empowerment was related to lower levels of stigma stress and self-contempt. These findings remained significant after controlling for psychiatric symptoms, diagnosis, age, gender and the number of lifetime involuntary hospitalizations. Increased self-stigma and reduced empowerment in turn predicted poorer quality of life and reduced self-esteem. The negative effect of emotional reactions and stigma stress on quality of life and self-esteem was largely mediated by increased self-stigma and reduced empowerment. Shame and self-contempt as reactions to involuntary hospitalization as well as stigma stress may lead to self-stigma, reduced empowerment and poor quality of life. Emotional and cognitive reactions to coercion may determine its impact more than the quantity of coercive experiences. Interventions to reduce the negative effects of compulsory admissions should address emotional reactions and stigma as a stressor.",

In 2014 about 38% of adult first-line regimens contain AZT and 62% TDF [1]. Whereas the unfavourable metabolic outcomes of D4T in comparison to TDF have been described extensively, studies from LMICs comparing metabolic profiles between patients on AZT and TDF are scarce. Given the high number of patients in LMICs still taking AZT, data on their metabolic profile are needed. We present rates of metabolic syndrome (MS) in adult patients taking either AZT- or TDF-containing first-line, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)-based regimens.\r\nMaterials and Methods: Data derived from a cross-sectional multi-disease screening conducted in ten facilities in two rural districts of Lesotho, Southern Africa [2]. Patients were eligible if aged \u226525 years and on NNRTI-containing first-line ART \u22656 months. The MS definition for Africa of the International Diabetes Federation was applied [3]. Assessed potential predictors for MS were age, time on ART, virologic suppression, body-mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, wealth quintile, NNRTI (nevirapine (NVP) or Efavirenz (EFV)), history of previous D4T exposure and ART-backbone (AZT or TDF). Statistical analyses \u2013 stratified for sex \u2013 comprised univariate logistic regression for each predictor variable with subsequent construction of a multivariate model including all predictors with an association to MS at a significance level<0.1 in univariate analysis.\r\nResults: Out of 1026 patients, 660 (64.3%) were female. MS prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI 6.9\u201313.4) in men and 22.9% (19.7\u201326.3) in women. In women, aged \u226535 years, AZT-backbone, NVP-base, BMI \u226525kg/m2 and taking ART for \u22654.5 years were associated with MS in univariate analysis. In the multivariate model only AZT (adjusted odds-ratio: 2.2, 95% CI 1.4\u20133.6; p=0.001) and BMI \u226525kg/m2 (9.8; 2.8\u201334.1, p<0.001) were associated with MS. For men, age, higher wealth quintile, history of D4T exposure and BMI were associated with MS in univariate analysis. In the multivariate model only a BMI \u226525kg/m2 was associated with MS (8.9; 3.8\u201320.9, p<0.001).\r\nConclusion: In rural Lesotho, Southern Africa, the use of AZT instead of TDF among women who are on ART for \u22656 months predisposes to the development of metabolic syndrome. Given that, still 38% of first-line regimens in LMIC contain AZT, this finding needs to be verified in other settings in Sub-Saharan Africa",

Using quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified RASA4 isoform 2, which maps to chromosome 7 and encodes a member of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins for small G proteins, as a recurrent target of isoform-specific DNA hypermethylation in JMML (51% of 125 patients analyzed). RASA4 isoform 2 promoter methylation correlated with clinical parameters predicting poor prognosis (older age, elevated fetal hemoglobin), with higher risk of relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and with PTPN11 mutation. The level of isoform 2 methylation increased in relapsed cases after transplantation. Interestingly, most JMML cases with monosomy 7 exhibited hypermethylation on the remaining RASA4 allele. The results corroborate the significance of epigenetic modifications in the phenotype of aggressive JMML.",

In addition, the potential impact of CD on growth, pubertal and emotional development of patients underlines the need for a specific management strategy of pediatric-onset CD. To develop the first evidenced based and consensus driven guidelines for pediatric-onset CD an expert panel of 33 IBD specialists was formed after an open call within the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterolog, Hepatology and Nutrition. The aim was to base on a thorough review of existing evidence a state of the art guidance on the medical treatment and long term management of children and adolescents with CD, with individualized treatment algorithms based on a benefit-risk analysis according to different clinical scenarios. In children and adolescents who did not have finished their growth, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the induction therapy of first choice due to its excellent safety profile, preferable over corticosteroids, which are equipotential to induce remission. The majority of patients with pediatric-onset CD require immunomodulator based maintenance therapy. The experts discuss several factors potentially predictive for poor disease outcome (such as severe perianal fistulizing disease, severe stricturing/penetrating disease, severe growth retardation, panenteric disease, persistent severe disease despite adequate induction therapy), which may incite to an anti-TNF-based top down approach. These guidelines are intended to give practical (whenever possible evidence-based) answers to (pediatric) gastroenterologists who take care of children and adolescents with CD; they are not meant to be a rule or legal standard, since many different clinical scenario exist requiring treatment strategies not covered by or different from these guidelines.",

Accumulating evidence supports augmentation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signalling as a potential therapeutic strategy for HF with reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively). Direct soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators target reduced cGMP generation due to insufficient sGC stimulation and represent a promising method for cGMP enhancement.  METHODS  The phase II SOluble guanylate Cyclase stimulatoR in heArT failurE Study (SOCRATES) programme consists of two randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre studies, SOCRATES-REDUCED (in patients with LVEF <45%) and SOCRATES-PRESERVED (in those with LVEF \u2265 45%), that will explore the pharmacodynamic effects, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of four dose regimens of the once-daily oral sGC stimulator vericiguat (BAY 1021189) over 12 weeks compared with placebo. These studies will enrol patients stabilized during hospitalization for HF at the time of discharge or within 4 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint in SOCRATES-REDUCED is change in NT-proBNP at 12 weeks. The primary endpoints in SOCRATES-PRESERVED are change in NT-proBNP and left atrial volume at 12 weeks.  PERSPECTIVES  SOCRATES will be the first programme to enrol specifically both inpatients and outpatients with WCHF and patients with reduced or preserved ejection fraction. Results will inform the benefits of pursuing subsequent event-driven clinical outcome trials with sGC stimulators in this patient population.",

Two sets of logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations between NMPDU of opioid analgesics, sedatives or sleeping pills, anxiolytics, antidepressants, beta blockers and stimulants, and health status (assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Survey Instrument [SF-12 v2]). We first computed odds ratios between NMPDU at baseline and poor mental and physical health at follow-up, adjusting for poor mental or physical health at baseline. We then computed odds ratios between poor mental and physical health at baseline and NMPDU at follow-up, adjusting for NMPDU at baseline.\r\nRESULTS: Three key findings regarding mental health were (1) there was a reciprocal risk between poor mental health and sedatives and anxiolytics; (2) poor mental health increased NMPDU of opioid analgesics and antidepressants but not vice versa; and (3) there were no associations with stimulants. Three key findings regarding physical health were (1) poor physical health increased the risk of NMPDU of anxiolytics; (2) the only reciprocal risk was between physical health and NMPDU of opioid analgesics; and (3) there were no associations with stimulants.\r\nCONCLUSION: These results, among the first ever on reciprocal effects between NMPDU and mental and physical health status, give unique information concerning the adverse effects of NMPDU on health and vice versa. The study shows that NMPDU is not only a sign of self-medication but may induce health problems.",

Although prescription drugs are considered safer than illicit street drugs, NMUPD can lead to detrimental consequences. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between drug use (NMUPD on the one side, illicit street drugs on the other side) with mental health issues and then compare these associations. A representative sample of 5719 young Swiss men aged around 20 years filled in a questionnaire as part of the ongoing baseline Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF). Drug use (16 illicit street drugs and 5 NMUPDs, including sleeping pills, sedatives, pain killers, antidepressants, stimulants) and mental health issues (depression, SF12) were assessed. Simple and multiple linear regressions were employed. In simple regressions, all illicit and prescription drugs were associated with poorer mental health. In multiple regressions, most of the NMUPDs, except for stimulants, were significantly associated with poorer mental health and with depression. On the contrary, the only associations that remained significant between illicit street drugs and mental health involved cannabis. NMUPD is of growing concern not only because of its increasing occurrence, but also because of its association with depression and mental health problems, which is stronger than the association observed between these problems and illicit street drug use, excepted for cannabis. Therefore, NMUPD must be considered in screening for substance use prevention purposes.",

Because of poor quality of life, high functional class (NYHA Class III) and the high risk of surgery, the patient agreed to undergo the implantation of a MitraClip device. During the procedure, the transoesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) images were of a poor quality since the view of the mitral valve in the mid-oesophageal and transgastric projections did not accurately show the valve leaflets and the convergence area of the regurgitation at colour Doppler, which is indispensable for the correct positioning of the clip.\r\nINVESTIGATION: Physical examination, transthoracic echocardiography, transoesophageal echocardiography.\r\nDIAGNOSIS: Severe mitral regurgitation suitable for MitraClip implantation.\r\nMANAGEMENT: Transthoracic, and not transoesophageal, echocardiography approach during MitraClip procedure.",

Aim: To investigate the effect of disease-unspecific motivational training on self-management adherence in addition to asthma-specific patient education. Methods: We randomized patients with partly controlled asthma to asthma education, with or without the Zurich Resource Model (ZRM) training. Main elements of the ZRM training are development of action-oriented personal goals and activation of resources to achieve and practice them in daily life. The primary outcome was adherence to self-monitoring and to a written personal action plan during three months. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported self-efficacy. Results: As control patients (n=30) were younger, mostly male and had better asthma control compared with the intervention group (n=30), we adjusted the analyses for these imbalances. Both groups showed excellent adherence to self-monitoring over three months [27 patients (90.0%) in intervention and 25 patients (83.3%) in control group, adjusted odds ratio: 1.28 (0.24-6.78), P=0.78)]. Patients in the ZRM group tended to adjust their medication more often [median 36% days with action (IQR 11-62%)] than control patients [9% (0-43), P=0.18]. In both groups, actions were rarely in accordance with the action plan [median 20% of actions appropriate (IQR 0-37) in intervention and 11% (IQR 0-56) in control group, P=0.92]. After three months, self-efficacy was significantly better with ZRM (adjusted difference on self-efficacy scale 2.31, 95% CI 0.31-4.31, P=0.02). Conclusion: Unspecific self-management training had no short-term effect on self-management adherence in asthma patients. Self-efficacy improved, but it is uncertain whether this translates into better long-term outcomes.",

Neuroimaging research has emphasized structural and functional alterations in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as one key mechanism underlying this disorder. The present study aimed to clarify the long-term influence of early poverty on OFC volume and its association with CD symptoms in healthy participants of an epidemiological cohort study followed since birth. At age 25 years, voxel-based morphometry was applied to study brain volume differences. Poverty (0=non-exposed (N=134), 1=exposed (N=33)) and smoking during pregnancy were determined using a standardized parent interview, and information on maternal responsiveness was derived from videotaped mother-infant interactions at the age of 3 months. CD symptoms were assessed by diagnostic interview from 8 to 19 years of age. Information on life stress was acquired at each assessment and childhood maltreatment was measured using retrospective self-report at the age of 23 years. Analyses were adjusted for sex, parental psychopathology and delinquency, obstetric adversity, parental education, and current poverty. Individuals exposed to early life poverty exhibited a lower OFC volume. Moreover, we replicated previous findings of increased CD symptoms as a consequence of childhood poverty. This effect proved statistically mediated by OFC volume and exposure to life stress and smoking during pregnancy, but not by childhood maltreatment and maternal responsiveness. These findings underline the importance of studying the impact of early life adversity on brain alterations and highlight the need for programs to decrease income-related disparities.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 10 December 2014; doi:10.1038/npp.2014.277.",

METHODS:  Thirty-eight consecutive patients with acute anterior circulation stroke who received interventional neuroradiologic treatment were assigned one of 2 groups depending on the patient's degree of collateral flow (18 patients with poor collaterals, 20 patients with high degree collaterals) according to the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology grading system. In a multiregression model, we investigated a possible interaction between 2 independent variables mismatch ratio and degree of collateral flow using a \"centered\" variable approach. RESULTS:  The mismatch ratio per se showed a significant correlation with final clinical outcome (\u03b2 coefficient, -0.79; P = 0.02); whereas, there was no interaction shown between mismatch degree of collateral flow (\u03b2 coefficient, 0.54; P = 0.1).

We therefore aimed to examine the longitudinal relationship between depression, behavioral factors, and glycemic control.  METHODS  In a prospective component of a nationally representative sample, 866 patients with type 2 diabetes aged >or=18 years completed a standardized assessment including a laboratory screening, questionnaires, and diagnostic measures. Subsequent to baseline (t(0)), patients were tracked over a period of 12 months (t(1)). Depression was assessed according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. Glycemic control was determined by levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)); a level of >or=7% was judged as unsatisfactory. Regression analyses were performed to analyze the prospective relationship between depression, medication adherence, diabetes-related health behavior, and HbA(1c).  RESULTS  Patients with depression at t(0) revealed increased rates of medication nonadherence (adjusted OR: 2.67; CI: 1.38-5.15) at t(1). Depression (adjusted regression coefficient: beta = 0.96; p = 0.001) and subthreshold depression (beta = 1.01; p < 0.001) at t(0) also predicted increased problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t(1). Adjusted ORs for poor glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7%) at t(1) were also increased for patients with baseline depression (2.01; CI: 1.10-3.69). However, problems with medication adherence as well as problems with diabetes-related health behavior at t(0) did not predict poor glycemic control at t(1).  CONCLUSIONS  In a prospective representative study of patients with type 2 diabetes, baseline depression predicted problems with medication adherence, problems with health-related behaviors, and unsatisfactory glycemic control at follow-up.",

Secondly, we investigated whether computed volumetry provides new prognostic indicators for histological response of osteosarcomas after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r\nMETHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, data from the Vienna Bone Tumour Registry was used. MR images from 14 patients (male:female = 1.8, mean age 19\u00a0years) were analysed prior to and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to current therapy regimens. Histological response to chemotherapy was graded according to the Salzer-Kuntschik classification. Computed volumetry was performed for the intraosseous part, as well as the soft-tissue component and the tumour as a whole.\r\nRESULTS: In a setting of appropriate radiological equipment, the method has been considered to be well implementable into clinical routine. The mean tumour volume prior to chemotherapy was 321\u2009(\u00b1351) ml. In good responders (n\u2009=\u20096), overall tumour volume decreased by 47\u00a0% (p\u2009=\u20090.345), whereas poor responders (n\u2009=\u20098) showed a 19\u00a0% decrease (p\u2009=\u20090.128). Neoadjuvant multidrug therapy remarkably changed the tumour composition. This is seen in a decrease of the mean ratio of soft-tissue to intraosseous tumour volume from 8.67 in poor responders and 1.15 in good responders to 1.26 and 0.45 (p\u2009=\u20090.065), respectively. Interestingly, the bony compartment of good responders showed a volume increase during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p\u2009=\u20090.073). However, we did not find prognostic markers for histological tumour response to pre-operative chemotherapy.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Separated volumetry of tumour segments revealed interesting insights into therapy-induced growth patterns. If verified in a larger study population, these results should be taken into account when planning ablative surgery.",

Bleeding/spotting days, daily use of ring or pill, was recorded. Endpoint was the total number of bleeding/spotting days for each method over four 90-day reference periods (RP) plus the analysis of bleeding patterns using modified World Health Organization criteria.\r\nRESULTS: There was a reduction in the mean (\u00b1S.D.) number of bleeding/spotting days from RP1 (CVR 14.2\u00b110; pill 16.6\u00b110.9) to RP4 (CVR 8.8\u00b19.6; pill 8.8\u00b19.1). Fifteen percent of CVR and 4% COC users experienced amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding throughout the study. Amenorrhea increased over time (RP1 vs. RP4: CVR 10% vs. 21% and COC 2% vs. 30%). Compliance with the menstrually signaled regimen was poor. Ceasing hormones for 4days stopped a bleeding episode within 5days in the majority of episodes and many stopped spontaneously.\r\nCONCLUSION: Bleeding patterns with continuous use of the CVR and COC are similar and improve over 1year of use. The unpredictability, but short duration, of bleeding episodes should be stressed during counseling.\r\nIMPLICATION: This information for clinicians and women about breakthrough bleeding patterns with use of a CVR or combined pill over 12months using a menstrually signaled regimen will give women an indication of what to expect with continuous use.",

Its donor-site morbidity has been extensively investigated in adults - but not in children - and is considered to be nonrestrictive. The aim of this long-term study was to assess donor-site morbidity with the modified Constant score more than 8 years after coverage of large myelomeningocele (MMC) defects with a reverse latissimus dorsi flap.  METHODS  Within the first days after birth, the reverse latissimus dorsi muscle flap was used uni- or bilaterally in three neonates to cover a large MMC defect. Bilateral shoulder function was tested more than 8 years postoperatively according to the modified Constant score.  RESULTS  The mean age at follow-up was 11.7 years. None of the patients experienced any pain or shoulder restrictions during normal daily activities. They all managed to position both of their arms comfortably above the head. Forward flexion was normal in all patients as was abduction and external rotation. Dorsal extension was minimally reduced on the operated side. Internal rotation was symmetric in all patients; the extent of active movement varied from excellent to poor.  CONCLUSIONS  Our long-term data suggest that there is no specific and significant impairment of shoulder function after using the distally pedicled reverse LDF for neonatal MMC repair.",

Recurrence rates vary widely in the literature depending on tumor localization, primary tumor stage, and treatment modality, and only a minority of patients can be salvaged.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study.\r\nSETTING: This study valuates the outcomes of patients treated for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, pharynx, and oral cavity in the largest tertiary referral center of Switzerland to find predictors for survival in salvage surgery with curative intent.\r\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Included were 176 consecutive patients with recurrent disease after primary curative treatment of HNSCC, in locations mentioned previously. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with log-rank testing were performed depending on T and N stage, gender, treatment, and location of first relapse to evaluate the impact on overall survival, disease specific survival, and recurrence free survival.\r\nRESULTS: Overall successful salvage rates were 49.2% for laryngeal recurrence, 35.1% for oral cavity, 32.7% for oropharyngeal, and a mere 17.4% for hypopharyngeal recurrences. Predictive factors for better outcome were location of recurrence, female gender, lymph node status, and extent of salvage treatment.\r\nCONCLUSION: In case of recurrent disease, laryngeal cancers showed the best salvage rates, whereas in hypopharyngeal relapses, very few patients could be successfully salvaged. Patients therefore should be carefully selected and counseled for salvage treatment according to patient motivation, age, type of previous treatment, surgical resectability, and exclusion of distant recurrence.",

Single-modality therapy does not have a major impact on long-term survival and combined-modality therapies are being further evaluated. However, the relative contributions of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery have not been clearly determined at the present time. Moreover, the extent of resection and precise surgical procedure remain a highly debated topic. To better compare and combine results from different institutions and trials, uniform definitions of surgical procedures including extrapleural pneumonectomy and different forms of pleurectomy have recently been introduced. Due to the relatively higher morbidity and mortality of extrapleural pneumonectomy, there is currently a shift towards pleurectomy/decortication when a macroscopic complete resection of all tumour can be obtained by this procedure. In most recent trials, induction chemotherapy was administered to improve surgical resection rates but pathological complete responses are infrequently observed. The role of post-operative radiotherapy has to be further elucidated. Further treatment options that are currently explored include hyperthermic intrapleural chemotherapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy and photodynamic therapy. However, no randomised comparisons are available yet.",

The example of the so-called \u2018Prosperity Gospel\u2019 in Africa\nAbstract: Much of poverty alleviation theory and practice fails to sufficiently consider the following crucial factor: the religious dimension. This paper elaborates this thesis by focusing on the African context and the valuable resources African religious communities and movements can provide in the struggle against poverty. One particularly influential streak of present-time African religiousness serves as a case study: the so-called \u2018Prosperity Gospel\u2019 as part of Pentecostal Christianity. The author first argues for the continuing formative influence of religion on African conceptions of self, other, and world. Secondly, she provides a critical assessment of the impact of Pentecostalism and the \u2018Prosperity Gospel\u2019 on poverty alleviation. In comparison with secular ngos, Pentecostal churches emerge as the more effective agents of change. A third part situates the insights gained into a wider perspective, seeking ways to integrate the religious factor into a more holistic conception of and engagement against poverty.",

Here we demonstrate that an amino-acid substitution in the IFN\u03bb4 protein changing a proline at position 70 to a serine (P70S) substantially alters its antiviral activity. Patients harbouring the impaired IFN\u03bb4-S70 variant display lower interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression levels, better treatment response rates and better spontaneous clearance rates, compared with patients coding for the fully active IFN\u03bb4-P70 variant. Altogether, these data provide evidence supporting a role for the active IFN\u03bb4 protein as the driver of high hepatic ISG expression as well as the cause of poor HCV clearance.",

        "document": "Title: The epigenetic modifier EZH2 controls melanoma growth and metastasis through silencing of distinct tumour suppressors\nAbstract: Increased activity of the epigenetic modifier EZH2 has been associated with different cancers. However, evidence for a functional role of EZH2 in tumorigenesis in vivo remains poor, in particular in metastasizing solid cancers. Here we reveal central roles of EZH2 in promoting growth and metastasis of cutaneous melanoma. In a melanoma mouse model, conditional Ezh2 ablation as much as treatment with the preclinical EZH2 inhibitor GSK503 stabilizes the disease through inhibition of growth and virtually abolishes metastases formation without affecting normal melanocyte biology. Comparably, in human melanoma cells, EZH2 inactivation impairs proliferation and invasiveness, accompanied by re-expression of tumour suppressors connected to increased patient survival. These EZH2 target genes suppress either melanoma growth or metastasis in vivo, revealing the dual function of EZH2 in promoting tumour progression. Thus, EZH2-mediated epigenetic repression is highly relevant especially during advanced melanoma progression, which makes EZH2 a promising target for novel melanoma therapies.",

Rumination, defined as repetitive and unwanted past-centered negative thinking, is related with exaggerated HPA axis stress responses and poor health outcomes. The aim of this study was to test whether post-stress rumination was related with non-habituation of cortisol to repeated stress exposure. Twenty-seven participants (n=13 females) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) twice on consecutive afternoons. Post-stress rumination was measured after the first TSST, and HPA axis responses were assessed by measuring salivary cortisol 1 min before, and 1, 10, 20, 60, and 120 min after both TSSTs. Stress exposure induced HPA axis activation on both days, and this activation showed habituation indicated by lower responses to the second TSST (F=3.7, p=0.015). Post-stress rumination after the first TSST was associated with greater cortisol reactivity after the initial stress test (r=0.45, p<0.05) and with increased cortisol responses to the second TSST (r=0.51, p<0.01), indicating non-habituation, independently of age, sex, depressive symptoms, perceived life stress, and trait rumination. In summary, results showed that rumination after stress predicted non-habituation of HPA axis responses. This finding implicates rumination as one possible mechanism mediating maladaptive stress response patterns, and it might also offer a pathway through which rumination might lead to negative health outcomes.",

In the skin, GVHD can present in an acute (aGVHD), chronic lichenoid (clGVHD), or chronic sclerotic form (csGVHD). Measuring peripheral blood levels of the keratinocyte-derived protease inhibitor elafin has recently emerged as a promising tool for the diagnosis of cutaneous aGVHD. We evaluated whether the analysis of elafin expression in skin would allow distinguishing aGVHD from drug hypersensitivity rashes (DHR) and whether cutaneous elafin expression would correlate with disease severity or altered prognosis of aGVHD and clGVHD/csGVHD. Skin biopsies from aGVHD (n=22), clGVHD (n=15), csGVHD (n=7), and DHR (n=10) patients were collected and epidermal elafin expression and its association with diverse clinical/histological parameters were analyzed. Acute GVHD and DHR displayed varying degrees of elafin expression. No elafin was detectable in csGVHD, whereas the molecule was increased in clGVHD as compared with aGVHD. Elafin-high aGVHD/clGVHD lesions presented with epidermal thickening and were associated with poor prognosis-i.e., decreased overall survival in aGVHD and corticosteroid resistance in clGVHD. Although cutaneous elafin does not seem to discriminate aGVHD from DHR lesions, our study strongly suggests an association between cutaneous elafin expression and poor prognosis for patients with cutaneous GVHD.",

        "document": "Title: Depression in spinal cord injury: Assessing the role of psychological resources\nAbstract: PURPOSE  To test the spinal cord injury adjustment model (SCIAM) and to examine how psychological resources may influence depressive symptoms in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). We expect that (a) higher general self-efficacy (GSE) and higher purpose in life (PIL) are associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms, and that (b) the effect of GSE and PIL on depressive symptoms is mediated by appraisals and coping strategies, as proposed by the SCIAM.  METHOD  A nationwide cross-sectional survey (the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury Cohort Study) was conducted with individuals with SCI living in the Swiss community (N = 516). Structural equation modeling was used to test relationships between variables as specified in the SCIAM.  RESULTS  Higher GSE (r = -.54) and PIL (r = -.62) were significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms. The initial model yielded poor model fit. However, the final modified model fitted well, with \u03c72(21) = 54.00, p < .01, RMSEA = .055 (90% CI [.038, .073]), CFI = .98, explaining 62.9% of the variance of depressive symptoms. PIL had a direct large effect and an indirect effect on depressive symptoms via appraisals and coping strategies. The influence of GSE on depressive symptoms was fully mediated by appraisals and coping strategies.  CONCLUSIONS  Psychological resources of individuals with SCI can have a direct effect on depressive symptoms. The mediated pathways are present, but not exclusive in our data, yielding only partial support for the mechanism proposed by the SCIAM.

We applied a more comprehensive model of trauma-specific coping and resilience, which included Ungar's context model and included decentral factors of resilience (i.e., environments that provide resources to build resilience).\r\n\r\nMETHOD: We assessed resilience in a cohort of former Swiss indentured child laborers (N = 74; 59% males) at two time points; first at the mean age of 80 years and then again 20 months later. At each time point, the following measures of resilience were assessed: resilience indicators of life satisfaction and lack of depression. In addition, resilience predictors of trauma exposure, perceived social support, dysfunctional disclosure of traumatic experiences, social acknowledgment as a victim, and self-efficacy; and decentral resilience factors of education, income, number of children, and physical health were measured.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Using path-analysis, we found that life satisfaction and lack of depression were predicted by dysfunctional disclosure, social support, and self-efficacy at various significance levels. Change scores of resilience were predicted by higher trauma exposure, social acknowledgment as a victim, and an interaction between the two. The model for decentral factors also fitted, with physical health and income predicting the resilience indicators.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Applying this comprehensive resilience model in a sample of older adults revealed meaningful findings in predicting resilience at a single time point and over time. Atypical coping strategies, such as perceived social acknowledgment as a victim and disclosure, may be particularly important for former victims who have suffered institutional abuse.",

        "document": "Title: Differently unequal: Zooming-in on the distributional dimensions of the crisis in euro area countries\nAbstract: This paper discusses how income inequality developed during the current crisis in euro area countries, as well as the role played by each income source. Based on an extended definition of income \u2013 including additional components which do not appear in the standard Eurostat definitions \u2013 we complement the information provided by the Gini index and quantile ratios by computing an alternative inequality indicator, developed by Zenga (2007), and its decomposition by income source. While broadly confirming the distributional effect of the crisis documented in previous studies, we find that in specific countries the level of inequality appears higher when alternative measures are taken into account, and that the rise of inequality since 2008 has not been as modest as the previous studies would suggest. The paper further looks at how the distribution of income has evolved during the crisis by income quantile groups (i.e. \u2018zooming-in\u2019). The results point to varying contribution of labour income in 2011 compared to 2007. In addition, while the impact of individual households' characteristics shows a non-linear pattern across income quantile groups before the crisis, such dispersion has decreased in 2011.\r\nWe argue that, on the basis of our analysis, not only euro area countries are \u201cdifferently unequal\u201d in that inequality has developed in a very peculiar way in different countries, but also because it needs to be tackled at a finer level of analysis.",

Underestimation of fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) results in inefficient anti-D prophylaxis and maternal immunization; overestimation of FMH results in higher doses of passively transferred anti-D, higher costs, and the risk of disease transmission. Thus, a reliable method to quantitatively assess FMH is necessary.  STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  Serial dilutions of artificial FMH were quantitatively measured by three different methods: flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy (each after anti-D staining), and by the Kleihauer-Betke test. The accuracy and precision of the three methods were compared by statistical analysis.  RESULTS  Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry were comparably accurate and precise in quantifying FMH. In contrast, the accuracy of the Kleihauer-Betke test was poor, resulting in substantial overestimation of FMH in the samples with lower fetal cell concentrations.  CONCLUSION  Anti-D flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy for detection of fetal cells offer equally reliable and precise methods in contrast to the Kleihauer-Betke test. Fluorescence microscopy may be established as standard to quantify FMH in clinical practice because it is comparable to flow cytometry; in addition, it is time saving and is less expensive.",

The objective of this retrospective analysis was to determine whether there are any initial findings that can help predict the long-term course of the disease.  METHODS  Case records of the 130 patients treated for type B aortic dissection between 1988 and 1997 were reviewed; 41 (31%) were operated on in the acute phase (<14 days), 31 (24%) were operated on in the chronic phase and 58 (45%) were treated medically.  RESULTS  Overall acute mortality was 10.8%; 22% for patients operated on in the early phase and 5.6% for medically treated patients. Age (P=0.002), persistent pain (P=0.01) and malperfusion (P=0.001) were significant independent predictors of the need for surgery. Paraplegia/para paresis (P=0.0001), leg ischaemia (P=0.003), pleural effusion (P=0.003), rupture (P=0.0001), shock (P=0.0001), age (P=0.003), cardiac failure (P=0.002) and aortic diameter >4.5 cm (P=0.002) were significant predictors of poor survival. Age and shock also emerged as independent risk factors. Patients without malperfusion (P=0.0001), pleural effusion (P=0.003), rupture (P=0.0001) and shock (P=0.0001) had a significantly better event-free survival (freedom from repeat surgery and death). The actuarial survival rate for high-risk patients (malperfusion, rupture, shock) was 62% at 1 year and 40% at 5 years; the corresponding values for low-risk patients were 94 and 84%, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS  Rupture, shock and malperfusion are significant predictors of poor survival in patients with acute type B aortic dissection.",

This study links the soluble forms of RAGE (sRAGE and esRAGE) with clinical outcome of melanoma patients. Moreover, tissue expression of RAGE was analyzed using immunohistochemistry on two independent tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 35 or 257 primary melanomas, and 41 or 22 benign nevi, respectively. Serum concentrations of sRAGE and esRAGE were measured in 229 stage III-IV patients using ELISA and plasma concentrations of sRAGE were analyzed in an independent second cohort with 173 samples of stage I-IV patients. In this cohort, three well-described SNPs in the RAGE gene were analyzed. RAGE protein expression was highly upregulated in primary melanomas compared to benign nevi in the two TMA (p\u2009<\u20090.001 and p = 0.005) as well as in sun-exposed melanomas (p = 0.046). sRAGE and esRAGE were identified as prognostic markers for survival as diminished sRAGE (p = 0.034) and esRAGE (p = 0.012) serum levels correlated with poor overall survival (OS). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that diminished serum sRAGE was independently associated with poor survival (p = 0.009). Moreover, diminished sRAGE was strongly associated with impaired OS in the second cohort (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis including the investigated SNPs revealed an independent correlation of the two interacting promoter SNPs with impaired OS. In conclusion, the soluble forms of RAGE and variants in its genetic locus are prognostic markers for survival in melanoma patients with high risk for progression.",

Persons eating and drinking under poor hygienic conditions have a rate of 20/1000 per month. This makes hepatitis A the most frequent infection in travelers that may be prevented by immunization. In many industrialized countries persons born after 1945 have an HAV antibody seroprevalence (immunity) of less than 20%. New inactivated HAV vaccines induce protective antibodies in more than 95% of recipients and offer protection estimated to last for 10 years or more, whereas protection by immune globulin lasts only 3 to 5 months.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis A vaccine, or immune globulin where HAV vaccine is not available, is recommended for all nonimmune travelers visiting developing countries. Prescreening for antibodies to HAV in travelers living in countries with low prevalence is usually not necessary in persons born after 1945.",

Clinical data on the management of these chronic wounds are scarce.  OBJECTIVE  We attempted to outline the threshold of systolic ankle pressure and ankle-brachial-index (ABI) below which arterial leg ulcers can occur and to outline the indication for revascularization in arterial leg ulcers.  METHODS  Diagnostic and outcome analysis was performed for 26 consecutive patients with arterial leg ulcers. We calculated sensitivities, specificities, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the identification of arterial leg ulcers among all 223 consecutive leg ulcer patients within a 3-year period, as well as the ROC curve for patients who required revascularization.  RESULTS  The systolic ankle pressure was 88 (18-130) mm Hg (median; 95% confidence interval) and the ABI was 0.60 (0.15-0.86), respectively. Eighteen patients (69%) were subjected to revascularization. By the end of the study, 24 patients (92%) healed completely, 1 improved (90% wound closure), and 1 patient had to undergo below-knee amputation for chronic osteomyelitis. During this study, the ankle pressure and ABI were poor in distinguishing those patients who required revascularization from those who healed without revascularization.  CONCLUSION  Most arterial leg ulcers do not meet the criteria of chronic critical limb ischemia, but they do not heal under conservative measures, either. A majority of these patients benefit from revascularization and should, therefore, be referred for arterial duplex ultrasound investigation or angiography. In our study, an ankle pressure below 110 mm Hg identified all patients (100%) who were subjected to revascularization procedures. However, controlled clinical studies are required to find the systolic ankle pressure and ABI below which revascularization can be recommended to speed up the healing time.",

Initial documentation of perinatal and resuscitation details was poor and neuromonitoring insufficient. In 2011, a National Asphyxia and Cooling Register was introduced.  AIMS  To compare management of cooled infants before and after introduction of the register concerning documentation, neuromonitoring, cooling methods and evaluation of temperature variability between cooling methods.  STUDY DESIGN  Data of cooled infants before the register was in place (first time period: 2005-2010) and afterwards (second time period: 2011-2012) was collected with a case report form.  RESULTS  150 infants were cooled during the first time period and 97 during the second time period. Most infants were cooled passively or passively with gel packs during both time periods (82% in 2005-2010 vs 70% in 2011-2012), however more infants were cooled actively during the second time period (18% versus 30%). Overall there was a significant reduction in temperature variability (p < 0.001) comparing the two time periods. A significantly higher proportion of temperature measurements within target temperature range (72% versus 77%, p < 0.001), fewer temperature measurements above (24% versus 7%, p < 0.001) and more temperatures below target range (4% versus 16%, p < 0.001) were recorded during the second time period. Neuromonitoring improved after introduction of the cooling register.  CONCLUSION  Management of infants with HIE improved since introducing the register. Temperature variability was reduced, more temperature measurements in the target range and fewer temperature measurements above target range were observed. Neuromonitoring has improved, however imaging should be performed more often.",

        "document": "Title: Prognostic value of tumor suppressors in osteosarcoma before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND  Primary bone cancers are among the deadliest cancer types in adolescents, with osteosarcomas being the most prevalent form. Osteosarcomas are commonly treated with multi-drug neoadjuvant chemotherapy and therapy success as well as patient survival is affected by the presence of tumor suppressors. In order to assess the prognostic value of tumor-suppressive biomarkers, primary osteosarcoma tissues were analyzed prior to and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  METHODS  We constructed a tissue microarray from high grade osteosarcoma samples, consisting of 48 chemotherapy na\u00efve biopsies (BXs) and 47 tumor resections (RXs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We performed immunohistochemical stainings of P53, P16, maspin, PTEN, BMI1 and Ki67, characterized the subcellular localization and related staining outcome with chemotherapy response and overall survival. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to analyze chemotherapy response and Kaplan-Meier-analysis as well as the Cox proportional hazards model was applied for analysis of patient survival.  RESULTS  No significant associations between biomarker expression in BXs and patient survival or chemotherapy response were detected. In univariate analysis, positive immunohistochemistry of P53 (P = 0.008) and P16 (P16; P = 0.033) in RXs was significantly associated with poor survival prognosis. In addition, presence of P16 in RXs was associated with poor survival in multivariate regression analysis (P = 0.003; HR = 0.067) while absence of P16 was associated with good chemotherapy response (P = 0.004; OR = 74.076). Presence of PTEN on tumor RXs was significantly associated with an improved survival prognosis (P = 0.022).  CONCLUSIONS  Positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) of P16 and P53 in RXs was indicative for poor overall patient survival whereas positive IHC of PTEN was prognostic for good overall patient survival. In addition, we found that P16 might be a marker of osteosarcoma chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, our study supports the use of tumor RXs to assess the prognostic value of biomarkers.",

Thirty women referred for pelvimetry (pregnant: n=15) were scanned twice in the supine position, once in the vertical open system and once in the closed system. Each patient completed a comfort and acceptability questionnaire. Pelvimetric and questionnaire data were compared between systems. Total scan time was double in the open system (7:52+/-1:47 vs 3:12+/-1:20 min). Poor image quality in the open system prevented assessment of interspinous and intertuberous diameters in one woman and all measurements in another, both pregnant, with abdominal circumferences >120 cm. The open system was much more acceptable in terms of claustrophobia and confinement (both p<0.01). Claustrophobia interrupted one closed examination. Thirty-three percent of pregnant women in both systems reported fear of fetal harm. Sixty percent of all women preferred the open system, 7% the closed system, and 33% had no preference. Limits of agreement of 3-5% from the mean for all diameters confirmed good pelvimetric reproducibility. Women's preference for open-system MR pelvimetry is feasible with abdominal circumferences <or=120 cm.",

Chronic inflammation may increase arterial stiffness. We tested whether arterial stiffness is increased children with asthma, a chronic disease characterized by fluctuating airway and systemic inflammation. Arterial stiffness, expressed as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVcf), was measured in 37 mild-to-moderate asthmatic children: 11 girls, median (range) age 11.1 years (6-15). PWVcf in asthma was compared to PWVcf in 65 healthy controls matched for age, height, and gender previously studied in Germany and was correlated with airway inflammation and obstruction. PWVcf was higher in asthmatic children compared to controls: PWVcf median (interquartile range) was 4.7 m/s (4.5-4.9) vs. 4.3 m/s (4.1-4.7), p\u2009<\u20090.0001. In asthmatic children, PWVcf was inversely associated (r (2)\u2009=\u20090.20, p\u2009=\u20090.004) with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). This association remained significant after adjusting for possible confounders including body mass index, blood pressure, steroid use, and FeNO.  CONCLUSION  Arterial stiffness is increased in children with mild-to-moderate asthma. The association between impaired lung function and increased arterial stiffness suggests that severity of disease translates into detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system.",

Persistent bronchial obstruction may occur in asymptomatic children and is considered a risk factor for severe asthma episodes and is associated with poor asthma outcome. Annual measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1\u2005s using office based spirometry is considered useful. Other lung function measurements including the assessment of BHR may be reserved for children with possible exercise limitations, poor symptom perception and those not responding to their current treatment or with atypical asthma symptoms, and performed on a higher specialty level. To date, for most methods of measuring lung function there are no proper randomised controlled or large longitudinal studies available to establish their role in asthma management in children. Noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring inflammation in children are available, for example the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide fraction, and the assessment of induced sputum cytology or inflammatory mediators in the exhaled breath condensate. However, their role and usefulness in routine clinical practice to monitor and guide therapy remains unclear, and therefore, their use should be reserved for selected cases.",

METHODS  A tissue microarray containing 348 tissue samples from 174 patients with primary urothelial carcinomas of the bladder was immunohistochemically stained for Cx43. The intensity of staining was semiquantitatively evaluated (score 0, 1+, 2+), and the association with clinicopathological features was assessed. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors for progression-free survival (PFS).  RESULTS  Membranous Cx43 immunoreactivity was detected in 118 (67.8%) of 174 analysable urothelial carcinomas, of which 31 (17.8%) showed even a strong (score 2+) and mainly homogeneous staining. Strong expression levels of Cx43 (score 2+) were associated with higher tumour grade, multiplicity and increased proliferation (all p<0.05). In the subgroup of patients with stage pTa and pT1 bladder tumours (n=158), strong Cx43 expression (p<0.001), solid growth pattern (p<0.001) and increased Ki-67 proliferation fraction (p<0.05) were significantly associated with shorter PFS in an univariable Cox regression analysis. In multivariable Cox regression models, Cx43 immunoreactivity and histological growth pattern remained highly significant and adverse risk factors for PFS.  CONCLUSIONS  The expression levels of Cx43 are frequent in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with high expression levels being associated with poor prognosis. Routine assessment of Cx43 expression may improve the identification of high-risk NMIBC.",

We aimed to investigate how differences between young and older adults vary across 11 high-income countries.  METHODS  A total of 20,045 participants from 11 high-income countries (i.e., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States) participating in the Commonwealth Fund 2013 International Health Policy Survey. We compared young adults (18-24 years) with older adults (25-34; 35-49; 50-64; 65+ years) on three aspects of health care: overall satisfaction, cost barriers to access, and four indicators of consultation quality relating to adequate information, time, involvement, and explanation.  RESULTS  Across all participants, young adults reported significantly worse overall satisfaction (63.6% vs. 70.3%; p < .001) and more frequent cost barriers (21.3% vs. 15.2%; p < .001) than older adults. Country-level analyses showed that young adults reported lower overall satisfaction than older adults in five of 11 countries (Australia, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, United States) and more frequent cost barriers in six of 11 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, United States). In five countries (Australia, Canada, France, Norway, Switzerland), most patient experience indicators were less positive among young adults than those among older adults. In three countries (Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom), there was no significant difference between young and older adults on any indicator.  CONCLUSIONS  Associations between age and health care access/experience varied markedly between countries, suggesting that poor access and experience among young adults is not inevitable and may be amenable to policy/practice interventions.",

Design-Prospective, uncontrolled clinical trial. Animals-10 client-owned dogs with naturally occurring diabetes mellitus. Procedures-Dogs were treated with insulin detemir SC every 12 hours for 6 months. Follow-up evaluations were done at 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks and included evaluation of clinical signs and measurement of blood glucose concentration curves and serum fructosamine concentrations. Results-Insulin detemir administration resulted in a significant decrease in blood glucose and serum fructosamine concentrations at 6 months, compared with pretreatment values. Median insulin dosage at the end of the study was 0.12 U/kg (0.055 U/lb; range, 0.05 to 0.34 U/kg [0.023 to 0.155 U/lb], SC, q 12 h). Hypoglycemia was identified in 22% (10/45) of the blood glucose concentration curves, and 6 episodes of clinical hypoglycemia in 4 dogs were recorded. A subjective improvement in clinical signs was observed in all dogs during the 6-month study period. On the basis of clinical signs and blood glucose concentration curves, efficacy of insulin detemir at the end of the study was considered good in 5 dogs, moderate in 3, and poor in 2. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggested that SC injection of insulin detemir every 12 hours may be a viable treatment for diabetes mellitus in dogs. Insulin detemir dosages were lower than reported dosages of other insulin types needed to maintain glycemic control, suggesting that insulin detemir should be used with caution, especially in small dogs.",

We examined the behavioural aspects of a cohort of travellers from Switzerland to low-risk malarial areas who, on recruitment, were provided with a kit containing medication for stand-by treatment, guidelines on the diagnosis of malaria, and materials for collection of blood samples for later confirmation of malaria. All subjects were urged to seek medical advice at the first signs of possible malarial symptoms. Illness (fever as the main indicator) was reported by 123 of the 1187 participants, often accompanied by shivering/chills (36.6%), headache (35.0%), gastrointestinal symptoms (69.9%), and myalgia and/or arthralgia (41.5%). Two-thirds of those ill failed to seek medical attention despite their symptoms and pretravel advice. Only 9 (7.3%) were actually beyond the reach of medical attention. The stand-by treatment was self-administered by 6 travellers, only one of whom had confirmed malaria. Two non-serious adverse events were reported. All users consulted a physician after administering the presumptive treatment. This stand-by approach is limited by inappropriate behaviour and poor malaria awareness among travellers. These negative factors can be mitigated by development of an improved kit containing a simple test for self-diagnosis.",

In addition, patient 1 is the only child with BD reported so far who achieved some developmental milestones. Although the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of BD remains unfavorable, the expansion of the phenotypic spectrum may be important in terms of counseling.",

DESIGN  Retrospective cohort study with matched control group.  SETTING  Tertiary perinatal centre.  PATIENTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES  We compared longitudinally collected data on neonatal and neurodevelopmental outcomes among 41 infants born in our institution from 1997 to 2010 with birth weight <1500 g and UA AREDF and 41 infants with prenatally normal UA Doppler parameters matched for gestational age, birth weight, sex and year of birth. We evaluated neurodevelopmental outcome at a median (range) corrected age of 23.3 (10.1-29.6) months using the Bayley scales of infant development, 2nd edition (BSID-II), and neurological examination.  RESULTS  The mental development index in UA AREDF children (median (range) 84 (49-116)) was significantly lower than in controls (median (range) 91 (62-140)), including after adjustment for confounders. Intergroup differences in psychomotor development index (PDI; BSID-II) and the rate of cerebral palsy or minor neuromotor dysfunction were non-significant.  CONCLUSIONS  VLBW infants with UA AREDF have a higher risk of poorer mental development during toddlerhood than controls matched for gestational age, birth weight, sex and year of birth. UA AREDF may be considered a prenatal predictor of poorer mental development in this population. Long-term follow-up studies with larger cohorts are needed to better evaluate the impact of this prenatal factor on later neurodevelopment.",

Patients with CUP had a low overall survival rate, comparable with that of patients with pN + HNSCC, and recurrent disease occurred with a similar likelihood as in patients with pN + HNSCC. The median recurrence-free survival in the CUP group was 28.5 months compared with 48 months in the whole of the HNSCC group. The median overall survival of the CUP group was 56 months versus 65 months for the HNSCC group. Extracapsular spread was the only independent prognostic factor for overall survival for CUP patients.\r\nCONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with CUP syndrome have a poorer prognosis for overall survival compared with other HNSCC patients. Postoperative radiotherapy diminished disease recurrence and improved overall survival. Omission of postoperative radiotherapy resulted in a very high recurrence rate (75%) for CUP patients. Based on these results we suggest postoperative radiotherapy including the oral mucosa for all patients, regardless of histopathological results, possible favorable nodal disease, or favorable lymph node ratios.",

Three randomized trials comparing SBRT and surgery were initiated but all three were stopped early due to poor accrual. As the next level of evidence, results from matched-pair analyses performed in single-institutional (n = 4), multi-institutional (n = 3) and population-based (n = 3) settings are available. There was close agreement between all studies that SBRT is at least equivalent to sublobar resection making it the preferred treatment for a high-risk population. SBRT was equivalent to lobectomy in the endpoints of loco-regional control and cancer-specific survival. Disease-free survival and overall survival were inferior after SBRT compared with lobectomy in one and two studies, respectively, and not significantly different in all other studies. Consequently, for patients without relevant comorbidities, who are accepting the risk of a surgical procedure, lobectomy remains the standard of care.",

The primary end point was overall survival (OS).\r\nResults: Thirty-eight patients were included in the analysis. Twenty-one (55%) patients had newly diagnosed AML, 14 (37%) had relapsed AML, and 3 (8%) underwent bridging therapy before allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Age at diagnosis was 72 years in the newly diagnosed cohort and 58 years in the relapsed cohort, 19 (50%) patients were female, 20 (53%) patients were transfusion dependent, and bone marrow blast count was 43% (interquartile range, 26-80). Most patients (58%) had poor or very poor risk AML. Patients received a median (range) of 7 (3-13) therapy cycles. The median (range) OS in the newly diagnosed and previously treated patient groups were 308 (175-580) days and 346 (293-628) days, respectively (P = .94). Median OS in the 3 patients treated before allogeneic stem-cell transplantation has not been reached. Sixty-day mortality was 7.9%, with no difference between the 2 groups. Ongoing or increasing transfusion dependency was associated with adverse outcome (hazard ratio, 3.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-7.37, P = .011).\r\nConclusion: Treatment with azacitidine led to a median OS of 10 months in both a previously untreated and a previously treated frail AML patient cohort. A positive effect in transfusion dependency was observed in 29% of these patients and was associated with better survival.",

It is unknown to what extent suboptimal hospital care contributes to these poor outcomes. This study reports on the scale, preventability, causes and prevention strategies of adverse events in patients, aged 65\u2005years and older, admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of hip fracture.\r\nDesign, setting and outcome measures A retrospective record review study was conducted of 616 hip fracture patients (\u226565\u2005years) admitted to surgical or orthopaedic departments in four Dutch hospitals in 2007. Experienced physician reviewers determined the presence and preventability of adverse events, causes and prevention strategies using a structured review form. The main outcome measures were frequency of adverse events and preventable adverse events in hospitalised hip fracture patients of 65\u2005years and older, and strategies to prevent them in the future.\r\nResults 114 (19%) of the 616 patients in the study experienced one or more adverse events; 49 of these were preventable. The majority of the adverse events (70%) was related to the surgical procedure and many resulted in an intervention or additional treatment (67%). Human causes contributed to 53% of the adverse events, followed by patient-related factors (39%). Training and close monitoring of quality of care and the health professional's performance were the most often selected strategies to prevent these adverse events in the future.\r\nConclusions The high percentage of preventable adverse events found in this study shows that care for older hospitalised hip fracture patients should be improved. More training and quality assurance is required to provide safer care and to reduce the number of preventable adverse events in this vulnerable patient group.",

People segregate along the lines of income, religion, ethnicity, language, and other characteristics. This study provides the first experimental examination of decentralized matching with search frictions and institutionalized segregation. The findings indicate that, without a segregation institution, high types over-segregate relative to the equilibrium prediction. We observe segregation attempts even when equilibrium suggests that everyone should accept everyone else. In the presence of a segregation institution, we find that, while the symmetric segregation institution increases matching success rate and efficiency in one environment, it has weak or no effect in a steep-incentive environment. By adding an entry cost to a flat-incentive market, however, the asymmetric segregation institution leads to an increased matching success rate and efficiency in both environments, which underscores the importance of a coordination device.",

In this prospective study, we have evaluated the reliability of on-site prothrombin time assessed by the portable coagulation monitor CoaguChek-Plus compared with standard laboratory assays during elective non-cardiac surgery. Sixty-two patients were assigned to one of three groups: group A = normal preoperative coagulation where minor intraoperative blood loss is expected; group B = normal preoperative coagulation where major intraoperative blood loss is expected; and group C = preoperative anticoagulation and minor intraoperative blood loss expected. On-site prothrombin time and laboratory prothrombin time showed poor correlation in group A (r2 = 0.24; bias (2 SD) 1.80 (3.34) S) and group B (r2 = 0.30; 1.43 (3.12) S).

Surgery during pregnancy resulted in fetal-neonatal morbidity and mortality of 9% and 30%, respectively, and in maternal morbidity and mortality of 24% and 6%, respectively. Duration of pregnancy at surgery and duration and temperature of cardiopulmonary bypass did not influence fetal-neonatal outcome. Maternal complications and mortality of surgery immediately after delivery were 29% and 12%, respectively, and for surgery performed with a postpartum interval the respective rates were 38% and 14%. Hospitalization after week 27 of gestation and extreme emergency contributed significantly to poor maternal outcome. Maternal deaths were reported in 9% of valvular procedures and in 22% of aortic or arterial dissection repairs and pulmonary embolectomies. Fetal-neonatal risks of maternal surgery during pregnancy are high and unpredictable. Maternal risks of cardiovascular procedures during pregnancy are moderate, significantly increase if an operation is performed at or after delivery, and, overall, should be considered as higher than those in nonpregnant cardiovascular surgical patients.",

Although leptospirosis can cause life-threatening disease, there is no global burden of disease estimate in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) available.\r\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We utilised the results of a parallel publication that reported global estimates of morbidity and mortality due to leptospirosis. We estimated Years of Life Lost (YLLs) from age and gender stratified mortality rates. Years of Life with Disability (YLDs) were developed from a simple disease model indicating likely sequelae. DALYs were estimated from the sum of YLLs and YLDs. The study suggested that globally approximately 2\u00b790 million DALYs are lost per annum (UIs 1\u00b725-4\u00b754 million) from the approximately annual 1\u00b703 million cases reported previously. Males are predominantly affected with an estimated 2\u00b733 million DALYs (UIs 0\u00b798-3\u00b769) or approximately 80% of the total burden. For comparison, this is over 70% of the global burden of cholera estimated by GBD 2010. Tropical regions of South and South-east Asia, Western Pacific, Central and South America, and Africa had the highest estimated leptospirosis disease burden.\r\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leptospirosis imparts a significant health burden worldwide, which approach or exceed those encountered for a number of other zoonotic and neglected tropical diseases. The study findings indicate that highest burden estimates occur in resource-poor tropical countries, which include regions of Africa where the burden of leptospirosis has been under-appreciated and possibly misallocated to other febrile illnesses such as malaria.",

EMT is associated with an increase of stem cell (SC) traits. We correlated the neural crest SC marker nestin and the EMT marker periostin with histology, type of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) and overall survival (OS) of MPM patients.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor tissues of a historic cohort 1 (320 patients) and an intended induction chemotherapy followed by extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) cohort 2 (145 patients) were immunohistochemically H-scored (intensity of immunoreactivity multiplied by frequency of stained cells). Paired chemo-na\u00efve biopsies and -treated surgical specimens were available for 105/145 patients. CT included platinum/gemcitabine (Pla/Gem) or platinum/pemetrexed (Pla/Pem).\r\nRESULTS: Expression of any cytosolic nestin progressively increased from epithelioid to biphasic to sarcomatoid MPM in cohort 1, whereas the diagnostic markers calretinin and podoplanin decreased. In cohort 2, Pla/Pem CT increased the expression level of nestin in comparison to Pla/Gem, whereas the opposite was found for periostin. In Pla/Pem treated patients, nestin was higher in biphasic MPM compared to epithelioid. In addition to non-epithelioid histology, any expression of nestin in chemo-na\u00efve biopsies (median overall survival: 22 vs. 17 months) and chemo-treated surgical specimens (18 vs. 12 months) as well as high periostin in biopsies (23 vs. 15 months) were associated with poor prognosis. In the multivariate survival analysis, any nestin expression in chemo-na\u00efve biopsies proved to be an independent prognosticator against histology. In both pre- and post-CT situations, the combination of nestin or periostin expression with non-epithelioid histology was particularly/ dismal (all p-values <0.05).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The SC marker nestin and the EMT marker periostin allow for further prognostic stratification among histologic variants of MPM. Their expression level is influenced by neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.",

It is unknown whether one of the clinically-available serum creatinine-based formulas to calculate eGFR is superior to the others for predicting mortality.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We quantified renal function using five different formulas (Cockroft-Gault, MDRD-4, MDRD-6, CKD-EPI in patients<70years, and BIS-1 in patients\u226570years) in 1104 unselected AHF patients presenting to the emergency department and enrolled in a multicenter study. Two independent cardiologists adjudicated the diagnosis of AHF. The primary endpoint was the accuracy of the five eGFR equations to predict death as quantified by the time-dependent area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC). The secondary endpoint was the accuracy to predict all-cause readmissions and readmissions due to AHF. In a median follow-up of 374days (IQR: 221 to 687days), 445 patients (40.3%) died. eGFR as calculated by all equations was an independent predictor of mortality. The Cockcroft-Gault formula showed the highest prognostic accuracy (AUC 0.70 versus 0.65 for MDRD-4, 0.55 for MDRD-6, and 0.67 for the combined formula CKD-EPI/BIS-1, p<0.05). These findings were confirmed in patients with varying degrees of renal function and in three vulnerable subgroups: women, patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, and the elderly. The prognostic accuracy for readmission was poor for all equations, with an AUC around 0.5.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Calculating eGFR using the Cockcroft-Gault formula assesses the risk of mortality in patients with AHF more accurately than other commonly used formulas.",

To address the possibilities of molecular subsets among astrocytoma or of diagnostic reclassification, we analyzed a series of 160 adult IDHwt tumors comprising 120 AA III and 40 diffuse astrocytomas WHO grade II (A II) for molecular hallmark alterations and established methylation and copy number profiles. Based on molecular profiles and hallmark alterations the tumors could be grouped into four major sets. 124/160 (78\u00a0%) tumors were diagnosed as the molecular equivalent of conventional glioblastoma (GBM), and 15/160 (9\u00a0%) as GBM-H3F3A mutated (GBM-H3). 13/160 (8\u00a0%) exhibited a distinct methylation profile that was most similar to GBM-H3-K27, however, lacked the H3F3A mutation. This group was enriched for tumors of infratentorial and midline localization and showed a trend towards a more favorable prognosis. All but one of the 120 IDHwt AA III could be assigned to these three groups. 7 tumors recruited from the 40 A II, comprised a variety of molecular signatures and all but one were reclassified into distinct WHO entities of lower grades. Interestingly, TERT mutations were exclusively restricted to the molecular GBM (78\u00a0%) and associated with poor clinical outcome. However, the GBM-H3 group lacking TERT mutations appeared to fare even worse. Our data demonstrate that most of the tumors diagnosed as IDHwt astrocytomas can be allocated to other tumor entities on a molecular basis. The diagnosis of IDHwt diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma should be used with caution.",

Clinical instruments predicting this influence, are of increasing interest. We sought to determine whether a count of a patient's preoperative pharmaceuticals would be associated to postoperative outcomes.\r\nMATERIAL AND METHODS In this retrospective, consecutive case series, 668 patients undergoing elective primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) were analysed. Age, gender, BMI, ASA-classification, nicotine or alcohol abuse, and the number and type of medications were documented.\r\nRESULTS Mean age was 63 years (18-94), 53% were females. A total of 60 (8.9%) local and 19 (2.8%) systemic complications occurred during hospital stay. A total of 11 (1.6%) patients died, while 49 (7.3%) local complications occurred during the first postoperative year. Length of hospital stay, blood transfusions, and morbidity were found to be significantly related to the quantity of medications (p&lt;0.001). While the risk of an extended hospital stay (&gt;7 days) increased by a factor of 1.15 (CI: 1.08-1.22) with each medication, the risk of experiencing a complication within the first postoperative year was 1.19 times (CI: 1.07-1.29) for each additional medication. Type of medication also influenced morbidity: the odds ratio was 1.89 (CI: 1.05-3.41) for platelet inhibiting agents and 4.07 (CI: 1.96-8.42) for oral anticoagulants in early morbidity, which increased to 6.05 (CI:2.92-12.53) in 1-year follow-up.\r\nCONCLUSIONS The investigation illustrated the significant influence of the number and/or type of medication on complications, morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. This predictive tool may be useful, for physicians and non-health professionals, in estimating particular outcomes after elective THA.",

Five studies reported on acute TNS and 11 on chronic TNS. In acute and chronic TNS, the mean increase of maximum cystometric capacity ranged from 56 to 132mL and from 49 to 150mL, and the mean increase of bladder volume at first detrusor overactivity ranged from 44 to 92mL and from 93 to 121mL, respectively. In acute and chronic TNS, the mean decrease of maximum detrusor pressure during the storage phase ranged from 5 to 15cm H2O and from 4 to 21cm H2O, respectively. In chronic TNS, the mean decrease in number of voids per 24h, in number of leakages per 24h, and in postvoid residual ranged from 3 to 7, from 1 to 4, and from 15 to 55mL, respectively. No TNS-related adverse events have been reported. Risk of bias and confounding was high in most studies.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary data of RCTs and non-RCTs suggest TNS might be effective and safe for treating NLUTD, the evidence base is poor, derived from small, mostly noncomparative studies with a high risk of bias and confounding. More reliable data from well-designed RCTs are needed to reach definitive conclusions.\r\nPATIENT SUMMARY: Early data suggest tibial nerve stimulation might be effective and safe for treating neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, but more reliable evidence is required.",

Here, we assessed the prognostic importance of response during induction and consolidation treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) aiming to evaluate the best time to assess minimal residual disease (MRD) for intervention strategies and in future trials in high-risk ALL relapse patients. Included patients (n=125) were treated uniformly according to the ALL-REZ BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster) 2002 relapse trial (median follow-up time=4.8 years). Patients with MRD \u2a7e10(-3) after induction treatment (76/119, 64%) or immediately preceding HSCT (19/71, 27%) had a significantly worse probability of disease-free survival 10 years after relapse treatment begin, with 26% (\u00b16%) or 23% (\u00b17%), respectively, compared with 58% (\u00b18%) or 48% (\u00b17%) for patients with MRD <10(-3). Conventional intensive consolidation treatment reduced MRD to <10(-3) before HSCT in 63% of patients, whereas MRD remained high or increased in the rest of this patient group. Our data support that MRD after induction treatment can be used to quantify the activity of different induction treatment strategies in phase II trials. MRD persistence at \u2a7e10(-3) before HSCT reflects a disease highly resistant to conventional intensive chemotherapy and requiring prospective controlled investigation of new treatment strategies and drugs.",

Amplification of the MYCN is the predominant marker for aggressive NB and correlates with poor prognosis, while c-MYC overexpression is a defining feature of MB subgroups inflected with aggressive biological behavior and increased likelihood of metastasis. Not surprisingly MYC has emerged as an attractive target for pediatric neural cancer therapy. However despite three decades of intensive research in MYC biology and an impressive number of 30,000 publications, inhibition of MYC as therapeutic strategy remains an elusive goal in cancer medicine. This review discusses the potential and challenges of targeting the oncogenic effects of MYC as therapeutic strategy for MYC over-expressing embryonal neural tumors where current therapies are inadequate.",

In our model the bank's assets consist of illiquid loans and liquid reserves and are financed by a combination of repos, long--term debt, deposits and equity. Repos are a cheap source of funding, but they are subject to an exogenous rollover risk. We show that their use adds to the cost of long--term debt financing, which limits the bank's appetite for unstable repo funding. This effect is, however, weakened under poor returns on assets, abundant deposit funding and the depositor preference rule. We also analyze the impact of a liquidity coverage ratio, payout restrictions and a leverage ratio on the bank's financing choices and show that all these tools are able to curb the bank's reliance on repos.",

The lack of controlled trials results in poor evidence for all therapeutic options. Upon recurrence, many patients are treated with bevacizumab or one of the frequently used nitrosoureas such as lomustine. However, patients who still present in overall good condition after failure of multiple lines of therapy may ask for additional therapy.  METHODS  Here, we report our experience with the use of carboplatin in combination with etoposide as fourth- or fifth-line therapy in patients with progressive high-grade glioma.  RESULTS  The median Karnofsky performance status at the beginning of treatment was 80%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.5 months. PFS at 6 months was 0%. Administration of carboplatin and etoposide was associated with grade 3 or 4 hematotoxicity in 8 of 12 patients.

Screening efforts aim to detect and tackle tumors at an early stage. However, regional population-based data at the time of initial diagnosis are sparse.\r\nOBJECTIVES: To analyse clinical and pathologic tumor characteristics in a Swiss population.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Melanoma samples diagnosed at a large Swiss academic department were evaluated for demographic, clinical and histopathologic data.\r\nRESULTS: We analysed a total of 254 melanoma samples. In situ tumors were more common in females than in males (70.6% vs. 29.4%; p = 0.0032). The acro-lentiginous subtype was more common in in situ compared to invasive tumors (14.7% vs. 5.5%; p = 0.0011). Invasive tumors showed a preference for male gender in patients beyond 60 years of age (p = 0.0080). The most frequent anatomic sites were the trunk in males and the legs in females. Regression was more common in males than in females (35.2% vs. 11.7%; p = 0.0001). Breslow's thickness correlated significantly with age but not with gender. Ulceration was common in tumors thicker than 2.01 mm (48.4%; p = 0.0001). Regression was frequently detected in melanomas thinner than 1.00 mm (29.3%; p = 0.0263).\r\nCONCLUSION: Screening efforts should target elderly patients. Skin examinations should include acral localisations and focus on the trunk in males and the lower extremities in females.

        "document": "Title: Modern fatherhood and its consequences on psychobiological well-being\nAbstract: Background: Today active involvement of the father in child rearing is taken for granted. For the father, the adaption to the new role during the transition to fatherhood leads to psychosocial consequences such as an elevated stress level, risk for psychopathology or a decrease in parental relationship quality. The other way round, mental health of the father has a significant influence on parental relationship quality and child development. Aside from psychosocial aspects (e.g. socio-economic status, personality traits, stress load), biological correlates, such as stress and male sexual hormones, interrelate with the adoption of the paternal role and thus might influence mental and physical health status of the father and satisfaction with the father role. As a consequence of modern family constellations, paternal care is not limited to the fathers' genetic offspring. Instead, in the form of step-, adoptive or foster fathers, men also invest in non-genetic offspring. While it is known that children coming from complex, non-traditional family models show a higher vulnerability for poor mental health, consequences on paternal health and well-being are relatively unknown. The goal of this study therefore is to investigate the consequences of modern fatherhood on paternal stress level, mental health and well-being.\r\n\r\nMethod: 3207 fathers, stepfathers, adoptive fathers and foster fathers of all age groups from the German-speaking part of Europe participated in a broad online survey on psychosocial conditions and costs of fatherhood across lifespan. Amongst other parameters, subjective chronic stress, psychological well-being and life satisfaction were assessed. In addition, biological parameters (cortisol, testosterone) were measured on a sub-sample (N = 428) of these fathers by collecting saliva samples.\r\n\r\nResults: Preliminary results show a significant impairment of mental health and general life satisfaction in fathers with complex family constellations compared to fathers living in a traditional father\u2013mother\u2013child family model. Beneath differences in socioeconomic status, part of this result can be explained by the lack of a steady relationship in this group of fathers. Hormonal correlates will be presented at the conference.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The additional stress load for fathers due to complex family constellations might represent a possible risk factor for higher vulnerability of children living in some types of contemporary family constellations.",

We conjecture that, holding all else equal, frequent job changes can indicate poor work attitude and that this information is transmitted through employment histories. We find support for this hypothesis across three studies that employ complementary lab, field, and survey experiments, as well as in labor market panel data. First, a tightly controlled laboratory labor market experiment demonstrates that prior employment information allows employers to screen for reliable and cooperative workers and that these workers obtain better employment outcomes. Second, we conduct a field experiment that varies the frequency of job changes in applicants\u2019 resumes and find that those with fewer job changes receive substantially more callbacks from prospective employers. Third, a survey experiment with Human Resources professionals confirms that the resume manipulations in the field study create different perceptions of work attitude and that these largely account for the callback differences. Finally, we find evidence consistent with our hypothesized relationships in empirical labor market data. Our work highlights the potential importance of job history as a signal of work attitude in labor markets, and points to a potential cost of frequent job changes.",

Here we show that a BCL9/9L-dependent gene signature derived from independent mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) models unprecedentedly separates patient subgroups with regard to progression free and overall survival. We found that this effect was by and large attributable to stemness related gene sets. Remarkably, this signature proved associated with recently described poor prognosis CRC subtypes exhibiting high stemness and/or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits. Consistent with the notion that highWNT signaling is required for stemness maintenance, ablating Bcl9/9l-\u03b2-catenin in murine oncogenic intestinal organoids provoked their differentiation and completely abrogated their tumorigenicity, while not affecting their proliferation. Therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting WNT responses may be limited by intestinal toxicity. Our findings suggest that attenuating WNT signaling to an extent that affects stemness maintenance without disturbing intestinal renewal might be well tolerated and prove sufficient to reduce CRC recurrence and dramatically improve disease outcome.",

However, the long-term vein graft durability is poor, with almost 75% of occluded grafts after 10 years. To improve the durability, the concept of an external supportive structure was successfully developed during the last years: the eSVS Mesh device (Kips Bay Medical) is an external support for vein graft made of weft-knitted nitinol wire into a tubular form with an approximate length of 24 cm and available in three diameters (3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 mm). The device is placed over the outer wall of the vein and carefully deployed to cover the full length of the graft. The mesh is flexible for full adaptability to the heart anatomy and is intended to prevent kinking and dilatation of the vein in addition to suppressing the intima hyperplasia induced by the systemic blood pressure. The device is designed to reduce the vein diameter of about 15-20% at most to prevent the vein radial expansion induced by the arterial blood pressure, and the intima hyperplasia leading to the graft failure. We describe the surgical technique for preparing the vein graft with the external saphenous vein graft support (eSVS Mesh) and we share our preliminary clinical results.",

        "document": "Title: The timing of extraction of non-restorable first permanent molars: a systematic review\nAbstract: AIM  To identify the ideal timing of first permanent molar extraction to reduce the future need for orthodontic treatment.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  A computerised database and subsequent manual search was performed using Medline database, Embase and Ovid, covering the period from January 1946 to February 2013. Two reviewers (JE and ME) extracted the data independently and evaluated if the studies matched the inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were specification of the follow-up with clinical examination or analysis of models, specification of the chronological age or dental developmental stage at the time of extraction, no treatment in between, classification of the treatment result into perfect, good, average and poor. The search was limited to human studies and no language limitations were set.  RESULTS  The search strategy resulted in 18 full-text articles, of which 6 met the inclusion criteria. By pooling the data from maxillary sites, good to perfect clinical outcome was estimated in 72% (95% confidence interval 63%-82%). Extractions at the age of 8-10.5 years tended to show better spontaneous clinical outcomes compared to the other age groups. By pooling the data from mandibular sites, extractions performed at the age of 8-10.5 and 10.5-11.5 years showed significantly superior spontaneous clinical outcome with a probability of 50% and 59% likelihood, respectively, to achieve good to perfect clinical result (p<0.05) compared to the other age groups (<8 years of age: 34%, >11.5 years of age: 44%).  CONCLUSION  Prevention of complications after first permanent molars extractions is an important issue. The overall success rate of spontaneous clinical outcome for maxillary extraction of first permanent molars was superior to mandibular extraction. Extractions of mandibular first permanent molars should be performed between 8 and 11.5 years of age in order to achieve a good spontaneous clinical outcome. For the extraction in the maxilla, no firm conclusions concerning the ideal extraction timing could be drawn.",

Although perceiving the need for mental health care was identified to be a key factor for service use, factors that explain differences in perceived need for mental health care are incompletely understood. The present paper investigates the role of illness representations in predicting perceived need for mental health care. METHODS: In a community sample of 202 persons currently distressed by symptoms related to mental illness, illness representations were assessed using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and perceived need for mental health care was measured by the Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine the association between a person's illness representations and the level of perceived need for mental health care. RESULTS: Two illness representations were positively associated with perceived need for mental health care: the belief that treatment could improve the current mental health problem and the attribution of experienced symptoms to a mental health problem. Increased perceived need for care was related to current mental health service use. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that aim to increase mental health service use could focus on people's attitudes toward mental health treatment and enable people to recognize symptoms as a mental illness.",

Despite complex treatment protocols, including chemotherapy combined with surgical resection, the prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma and metastases remains poor and more effective therapies are required. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of sunitinib malate, a wide-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in a preclinical mouse model of osteosarcoma. Sunitinib significantly inhibited proliferation, provoked apoptosis and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in the human osteosarcoma cell lines SaOS-2 and 143B in vitro. Importantly, sunitinib treatment significantly reduced tumour burden, microvessel density and suppressed pulmonary metastasis in a 143B cell-derived intratibial osteosarcoma model in SCID mice. Sunitinib significantly decreased primary tumor tissue proliferation and reduced tumor vasculature. Our study indicates that sunitinib has potential for effective treatment of metastasizing osteosarcoma and provides the framework for future clinical trials with sunitinib alone or in combination with conventional and other novel therapeutics aiming at increased treatment efficacy and improved patient outcome.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess recurrence and prognostic factors for neck pain in a chiropractic patient population at 1 year from the start of the current episode.  METHODS  Within a prospective cohort study, 642 neck pain patients were recruited by chiropractors in Switzerland. After a course of chiropractic therapy, patients were followed up for 1 year regarding recurrence of neck pain. A logistic regression analysis was used to assess prognostic factors for recurrent neck pain. The independent variables age, pain medication usage, sex, work status, duration of complaint, previous episodes of neck pain and trauma onset, numerical rating scale, and Bournemouth questionnaire for neck pain were analyzed. Prognostic factors that have been identified in previous studies to influence recovery of neck pain are psychologic distress, poor general health at baseline, and a previous history of pain elsewhere.  RESULTS  Five hundred forty five patients (341 females), with a mean age of 42.1 years (SD, 13.1) completed the 1-year follow-up period. Fifty-four participants (11%) were identified as \"recurrent.\" Prognostic factors associated with recurrent neck pain were previous episodes of neck pain and increasing age.  CONCLUSION  The results of this study suggest that recurrence of neck pain within 1 year after chiropractic intervention in Swiss chiropractic patients presenting from varied onsets is low. This study found preliminary findings that older age and a previous episode of neck may be useful predictors of neck pain recurrence within 1 year.",

Larger tumor size and more advanced disease stage at diagnosis could partly explain this outcome and nonadherence of obese women to BC screening may play a role. We examined the relationship between BMI (kg/m) and the use of mammography in Switzerland as well as separately in the German-speaking part with mainly opportunistic screening and in the French-speaking part with organized programs. We analyzed the data of 50-69-year-old women (n=3121) of the Swiss Health Survey 2012. Study participants were classified as underweight (BMI<18.5), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29), or obese (BMI\u226530). Outcome measures were dichotomized into 2 years or less since most recent mammography versus more than 2 years or never. We carried out multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographics, lifestyle, and self-perceived health. In Switzerland, 47% of women aged 50-69 years had had BC screening within the last 2 years, 35% of women in the German-speaking and 78% of women in the French-speaking part. In the total group, mammography use was higher in overweight than in normal-weight women (adjusted odds ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.49). Stratified by region, this effect was only maintained in women of the German-speaking part (adjusted odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.85; P-interaction<0.001). There were no differences in mammography attendance between normal-weight and obese and underweight women. In the 2012 Swiss Health Survey, overweight, obesity, and underweight were no barriers to mammography. In the German-speaking part, overweight women even attended mammography screening more often than normal-weight women.",

However, the predictive value of these markers for clinical outcomes in patients with MDR-TB is unknown to date. The objective of this study was to determine molecular markers and breakpoints predicting second-line treatment outcomes in M. tuberculosis patients treated with fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.  METHODS  We analysed treatment outcome data in relation to the gyrA and gyrB sequences and MICs of ofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin for pretreatment M. tuberculosis isolates from 181 MDR-TB patients in Bangladesh whose isolates were susceptible to injectable drugs.  RESULTS  The gyrA 90Val, 94Gly and 94Ala mutations were most frequent, with the highest resistance levels for 94Gly mutants. Increased pretreatment resistance levels (>2 mg/L), related to specific mutations, were associated with lower cure percentages, with no cure in patients whose isolates were resistant to gatifloxacin at 4 mg/L. Any gyrA 94 mutation, except 94Ala, predicted a significantly lower proportion of cure compared with all other gyrA mutations taken together (all non-94 mutants\u200a+\u200a94Ala) [OR\u200a=\u200a4.3 (95% CI 1.4-13.0)]. The difference in treatment outcome was not explained by resistance to the other drugs.  CONCLUSIONS  Our study suggests that gyrA mutations at position 94, other than Ala, predict high-level resistance to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, as well as poor treatment outcome, in MDR-TB patients in whom an injectable agent is still effective.",

        "document": "Title: Sleep at high altitude: guesses and facts\nAbstract: Lowlanders commonly report a poor sleep quality during the first few nights after arriving at high altitude. Polysomnographic studies reveal that reductions in slow wave sleep are the most consistent altitude-induced changes in sleep structure identified by visual scoring. Quantitative spectral analyses of the sleep electroencephalogram have confirmed an altitude-related reduction in the low-frequency power (0.8-4.6 Hz). Although some studies suggest an increase in arousals from sleep at high altitude, this is not a consistent finding. Whether sleep instability at high altitude is triggered by periodic breathing or vice versa is still uncertain. Overnight changes in slow wave-derived encephalographic measures of neuronal synchronization in healthy subjects were less pronounced at moderately high (2,590 m) compared with low altitude (490 m), and this was associated with a decline in sleep-related memory consolidation. Correspondingly, exacerbation of breathing and sleep disturbances experienced by lowlanders with obstructive sleep apnea during a stay at 2,590 m was associated with poor performance in driving simulator tests. These findings suggest that altitude-related alterations in sleep may adversely affect daytime performance. Despite recent advances in our understanding of sleep at altitude, further research is required to better establish the role of gender and age in alterations of sleep at different altitudes, to determine the influence of acclimatization and of altitude-related illness, and to uncover the characteristics of sleep in highlanders that may serve as a study paradigm of sleep in patients exposed to chronic hypoxia due to cardiorespiratory disease.",

One hundred five children were studied at baseline and after interventional cardiac catheterization during aspirin treatment and, in cases of aspirin resistance (AR), after dose increase. Results from arachidonate-induced aggregation (AA) were compared with aggregation induced by ADP, PFA-100 closure times (CTs), urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (urinary 11-dhTxB2) levels, and Impact-R % surface coverage. Aspirin at 2-5 mg/kg/day inhibited platelet function in a large majority. While 19 % showed bruising and mild epistaxis, no thrombotic complications were recorded. AR was detected by AA in seven children (6.7 %). After dose increase, the majority showed inhibition by aspirin. Infants had higher urinary 11-dhTxB2 baseline levels; this assay showed some correlation with AA. Both assays manifested high sensitivity and specificity for aspirin while inferior results were found for the other assays. With the PFA-100, 15.2 % of patients were found to have AR, but this corresponded to AR by AA in only one of seven children.\r\nCONCLUSION: While there was poor agreement among assays, AA and urinary 11-dhTxB2 show good specificity for the monitoring of aspirin therapy in children. Aspirin at 2-5 mg/kg inhibits platelet function; AR in children is rare and can be overcome by dose increase.",

The present review focuses on recent advances in hepatic GSD types I, III and VI/IX, with emphasis on clinical aspects and treatment.  RECENT FINDINGS  Evidence accumulates that poor metabolic control is a risk factor for the development of long-term complications, such as liver adenomas, low bone density/osteoporosis, and kidney disease in GSD I. However, mechanisms leading to these complications remain poorly understood and are being investigated. Molecular causes underlying neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction in GSD I have been elucidated. Case series provide new insights into the natural course and outcome of GSD types VI and IX. For GSD III, a high protein/fat diet has been reported to improve (cardio)myopathy, but the beneficial effect of this dietary concept on muscle and liver disease manifestations needs to be further established in prospective studies.  SUMMARY  Although further knowledge has been gained regarding pathophysiology, disease course, treatment, and complications of hepatic GSDs, more controlled prospective studies are needed to assess effects of different dietary and medical treatment options on long-term outcome and quality of life.",

Several European SyS systems use data collected during meat inspection for syndromic surveillance of animal health, as some diseases may be more easily detected post-mortem than at their point of origin or during the ante-mortem inspection upon arrival at the slaughterhouse. In this paper we use simulation to evaluate the performance of a quasi-Poisson regression (also known as an improved Farrington) algorithm for the detection of disease outbreaks during post-mortem inspection of slaughtered animals. When parameterizing the algorithm based on the retrospective analyses of 6 years of historic data, the probability of detection was satisfactory for large (range 83-445 cases) outbreaks but poor for small (range 20-177 cases) outbreaks. Varying the amount of historical data used to fit the algorithm can help increasing the probability of detection for small outbreaks. However, while the use of a 0\u00b7975 quantile generated a low false-positive rate, in most cases, more than 50% of outbreak cases had already occurred at the time of detection. High variance observed in the whole carcass condemnations time-series, and lack of flexibility in terms of the temporal distribution of simulated outbreaks resulting from low reporting frequency (monthly), constitute major challenges for early detection of outbreaks in the livestock population based on meat inspection data. Reporting frequency should be increased in the future to improve timeliness of the SyS system while increased sensitivity may be achieved by integrating meat inspection data into a multivariate system simultaneously evaluating multiple sources of data on livestock health.",

DESIGN  Retrospective cohort study of patients enrolled in the Kilombero Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO), Tanzania.).  METHODS  HIV patients without prior history of tuberculosis enrolled in the KIULARCO cohort between 2005 and 2013 were included.Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate rates and predictors of tuberculosis ascertainment.  RESULTS  Of 7114 HIV positive patients enrolled, 5123 (72%) had no history of tuberculosis. Of these, 66% were female, median age was 38 years, median baseline CD4+ cell count was 243 cells/\u00b5l, and 43% had WHO clinical stage 3 or 4. During follow-up, 421 incident tuberculosis cases were notified with an estimated incidence of 3.6 per 100 person-years (p-y) [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.26-3.97]. The incidence rate varied over time and increased significantly from 2.96 to 43.98 cases per 100 p-y after the introduction of the bundle of services in December 2012. Four independent predictors of tuberculosis ascertainment were identified:poor clinical condition at baseline (Hazard Ratio (HR) 3.89, 95% CI 2.87-5.28), WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.88-3.26), being antiretroviralna\u00efve (HR 2.97, 95% CI 2.25-3.94), and registration in 2013 (HR 6.07, 95% CI 4.39-8.38).  CONCLUSION  The integration of tuberculosis and HIV services together with comprehensive electronic data collection and use of GeneXpert increased dramatically the ascertainment of tuberculosis in this rural African HIV cohort.",

Die h\u00e4ufigste Indikation f\u00fcr eine antibiotische Gruppentherapie war Durchfall und das am meisten verwendete Antibiotikum Colistin. Im Durchschnitt wurden bei den Kontrollbetrieben 27.33 Tagesdosen und bei den Problembetrieben 387.21 Tagesdosen pro 1000 Absetzferkel an einem Tag verabreicht. Als signifikante Risikofaktoren im multivariaten Modell wurden mangelnde Tr\u00e4nkehygiene im Abferkelstall, keine oder weniger als zweimal t\u00e4gliche Pr\u00e4starterfuttergabe, kontinuierliche Bestossung des Absetzstalls, keine Herdebuch-Leistungsdatenauswertung und weniger als zwei der gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Tierarzneimittelbesuche (TAM-Besuche) pro Jahr durch den Bestandestierarzt festgestellt. Ferner wurde anhand der Arzneimittelinventarlisten auf den Betrieben die Tierbehandlungsinzidenz der Absetzferkel f\u00fcr oral verabreichte Antibiotika berechnet. Dieses Ergebnis deutet darauf hin, dass der orale Antibiotikaverbrauch im Absetzstall durch Interventionen im Hygiene- und Managementbereich reduziert werden kann.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present study, risk factors for the use of oral antibiotics in weaned piglets were collected on 112 pig farms by a personal questionaire. The most common indication for an antibiotic group therapy was diarrhoea, and the most frequently used antibiotic was Colistin. On average, 27.33 daily doses in the control farms and 387.21 daily doses in the problem farms per 1000 weaners were administered on a given day. The significant risk factors in the multivariate model were poor hygiene in the water supply of suckling piglets, less than two doses of prestarter feed daily, lack of an all-in-and-all-out production system in weaners, no herd book performance data analysis, and less than two of the legally prescribed veterinary visits per year. Furthermore, the treatment incidence of weaners for oral antibiotics was calculated on the basis of the drug inventory. This study provides evidence that the use of oral antibiotics in weaners can be reduced by interventions in hygiene and management.",

Previous studies showed that the recurrent PIGA germline mutation c.1234C>T (p.Arg412*) leads to a clinical phenotype at the most severe end of the spectrum associated with early infantile lethality. We identified three additional individuals from two unrelated families with the same PIGA mutation. Major clinical findings include early onset intractable epileptic encephalopathy with a burst-suppression pattern on EEG, generalized muscular hypotonia, structural brain abnormalities, macrocephaly and increased birth weight, joint contractures, coarse facial features, widely spaced eyes, a short nose with anteverted nares, gingival overgrowth, a wide mouth, short limbs with short distal phalanges, and a small penis. Based on the phenotypic overlap with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2 (SGBS2), we hypothesized that both disorders might have the same underlying cause. We were able to confirm the same c.1234C>T (p.Arg412*) mutation in the DNA sample from an affected fetus of the original family affected with SGBS2. We conclude that the recurrent PIGA germline mutation c.1234C>T leads to a recognizable clinical phenotype with a poor prognosis and is the cause of SGBS2.",

STUDY DESIGN  We examined the associations between counts of the 3 morbidities and long-term outcomes in 1514 of 1791 (85%) infants with birth weights of 500-1250 g who were enrolled in the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity trial from October 1999, to October 2004, had complete morbidity data, and were alive at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). BPD was defined as use of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA. Serious brain injury on cranial ultrasound included grade 3 and 4 hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leucomalacia, porencephalic cysts, or ventriculomegaly of any cause. Poor long-term outcome was death after 36 weeks PMA or survival to 5 years with 1 or more of the following disabilities: motor impairment, cognitive impairment, behavior problems, poor general health, deafness, and blindness.  RESULTS  BPD, serious brain injury, and severe ROP occurred in 43%, 13%, and 6% of the infants, respectively. Each of the 3 morbidities was similarly and independently correlated with poor 5-year outcome. Rates of death or disability (95% CI) in children with none, any 1, any 2, and all 3 morbidities were 11.2% (9.0%-13.7%), 22.9% (19.6%-26.5%), 43.9% (35.5%-52.6%), and 61.5% (40.6%-79.8%), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS  In very low birth weight infants who survive to 36 weeks PMA, a count of BPD, serious brain injury, and severe ROP predicts the risk of a late death or survival with disability at 5 years.",

Hierarchical cluster analyses were performed to identify specific types of post-transplant outcomes in terms of psychological distress and HRQoL over the first six post-transplant months. Correlational analyses examined medical and psychosocial predictors of the outcome at 6 months post-transplant.\r\nRESULTS: Three distinctive clusters were identified, summarizing either groups of patients with (1) optimal (35%), (2) good (42%), and (3) poor outcome-clusters (23%). The latter tended to be older, to suffer from more severe disease, to have more co-morbidities, to have had a prolonged intensive care unit and/or hospital stay, to have more hospital admissions and were more frequently treated with antidepressants post-transplant. Disease severity, length of stay, quality of life two weeks post-transplant, hospital admissions and use of antidepressants were strong predictors of psychological distress and impaired health-related quality of life at six months of follow-up.\r\nCONCLUSION: Almost a quarter of the investigated patients suffered from elevated distress and substantially impaired HRQoL, with no improvements over time. Results underscore the psychosocial needs of patients with poor post-transplant outcomes.",

        "document": "Title: Frontal brain activity and behavioral indicators of affective states are weakly affected by thermal stimuli in sheep living in different housing conditions\nAbstract: Many stimuli evoke short-term emotional reactions. These reactions may play an important role in assessing how a subject perceives a stimulus. Additionally, long-term mood may modulate the emotional reactions but it is still unclear in what way. The question seems to be important in terms of animal welfare, as a negative mood may taint emotional reactions. In the present study with sheep, we investigated the effects of thermal stimuli on emotional reactions and the potential modulating effect of mood induced by manipulations of the housing conditions. We assume that unpredictable, stimulus-poor conditions lead to a negative and predictable, stimulus-rich conditions to a positive mood state. The thermal stimuli were applied to the upper breast during warm ambient temperatures: hot (as presumably negative), intermediate, and cold (as presumably positive). We recorded cortical activity by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, restlessness behavior (e.g., locomotor activity, aversive behaviors), and ear postures as indicators of emotional reactions. The strongest hemodynamic reaction was found during a stimulus of intermediate valence independent of the animal\u2019s housing conditions, whereas locomotor activity, ear movements, and aversive behaviors were seen most in sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor housing conditions, independent of stimulus valence. We conclude that, sheep perceived the thermal stimuli and differentiated between some of them. An adequate interpretation of the neuronal activity pattern remains difficult, though. The effects of housing conditions were small indicating that the induction of mood was only modestly efficacious. Therefore, a modulating effect of mood on the emotional reaction was not found.",

These tumors are associated with early recurrence and poor prognosis. This study assessed the clinical outcome and late toxicity of pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy (PT) in the treatment of children with PM-RMS.\r\nPROCEDURES: Thirty-nine children with PM-RMS received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by PBS-PT at the Paul Scherrer Institute, with concomitant chemotherapy. The median age was 5.8 years (range, 1.2-16.1). Due to young age, 25 patients (64%) required general anesthesia during PT. The median time from the start of chemotherapy to PT was 13 weeks (range, 3-23 weeks). Median prescription dose was 54 Gy (relative biologic effectiveness, RBE).\r\nRESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 41 months (range, 9-106 months), 10 patients failed. The actuarial 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 72% (95% CI, 67-94%) and the 5-year overall survival was 73% (95% CI, 69-96%). On univariate analysis, a delay in the initiation of PT (>13 weeks) was a significant detrimental factor for PFS. Three (8%) patients presented with grade 3 radiation-induced toxicity. The estimated actuarial 5-year toxicity \u2265grade 3 free survival was 95% (95% CI, 94-96%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data contribute to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of PT for pediatric patients with PM-RMS. These preliminary results are encouraging and in line with other combined proton-photon and photons series; observed toxicity was acceptable.",

Severe acute babesiosis is characterized by a high mortality but prognosis is not always correlated with clinical signs nor with the level of parasitemia.  OBJECTIVE  This study evaluated prognostic markers associated with poor outcomes in acute Babesia canis infections.  ANIMALS AND METHODS  We compared the results of routine laboratory profiles, hand-held lactate and glucose analyzer, and the acute phase response in 2 groups of naturally infected dogs (7 survivors and 8 nonsurvivors). Samples were collected at the time of first admission and before any treatment. Subsequently, the course of prognostic markers was followed in 3 dogs experimentally inoculated with B. canis.  RESULTS  Nonsurvivors showed significantly higher concentrations of lactate, triglycerides and phosphate and lower hematocrit, leukocyte counts, total serum protein concentrations, and thrombocyte counts when compared to survivors. All nonsurvivors (8/8) had hyperlactatemia, whereas most survivors (6/7) had values within the reference range. All survivors had leucocyte counts within the reference range, unlike the nonsurvivors, which showed leukopenia. During the course of acute babesiosis, the variables serum lactate, triglyceride, and phosphate concentrations, and thrombocyte count only exceeded a prognostic threshold during acute crisis.  CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE  Poor outcome in acute B. canis infection is indicated by changes in the laboratory profile. Intensive care should be considered for dogs presenting with moderate anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, mild to moderate leukopenia, hyperlactatemia, moderately increased serum phosphate, and triglyceride concentrations, and moderately decreased total serum protein concentrations.",

Clinical prediction of BPD at an early stage in life is difficult. Plasma proendothelin-1 (CT-proET-1) is a lung injury biomarker in pulmonary hypertension and respiratory distress.\r\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic ability of CT-proET-1 in BPD.\r\nMETHODS: In 227 prospectively enrolled preterm infants born at <32 weeks gestational age (GA), plasma CT-proET-1 was measured at birth, day of life (DOL) 2, 3, 6 and 28, and at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). BPD was defined as mild in infants requiring supplemental oxygen at DOL 28 and moderate/severe in those requiring it at 36 weeks PMA.\r\nRESULTS: The predictive ability of CT-proET-1 for any BPD was poor at birth [area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.654, 95% CI 0.494-0.814], moderate at DOL 2 and 3 (AUC 0.769, 95% CI 0.666-0.872) and excellent at DOL 6 (AUC 0.918, 95% CI 0.840-0.995). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that CT-proET-1 levels at DOL 2, 3, 6 and 28 were strongly related to the duration of oxygen supplementation, independently of GA and the duration of respiratory support.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: CT-proET-1 is a novel promising biomarker for predicting the development of BPD in preterm infants when measured at the end of the first week of life.",

In addition, some forms of neonatal infant seizures are due to inborn errors of metabolism that do not respond to common AEDs, but are amenable to specific treatment. In this situation, early recognition can allow seizure control and will prevent neurological deterioration and long-term sequelae.

However, high-resolution manometry (HRM) and EPT require increased equipment costs over conventional systems and evidence demonstrating a significant diagnostic advantage of EPT over CLT is limited. Our aim was to investigate whether the inter-rater agreement and/or accuracy of esophageal motility diagnosis differed between EPT and CLT.\r\nMETHODS: Forty previously completed patient HRM studies were selected for analysis using a customized software program developed to perform blinded independent interpretation in either EPT or CLT (six pressure sensors) format. Six experienced gastroenterologists with a clinical focus in esophageal disease (attendings) and six gastroenterology trainees with minimal manometry experience (fellows) from three academic centers interpreted each of the 40 studies using both EPT and CLT formats. Rater diagnoses were assessed for inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy, both for exact diagnosis and for correct identification of a major esophageal motility disorder.\r\nRESULTS: The total group agreement was moderate (\u03ba=0.57; 95% CI: 0.56-0.59) for EPT and fair (\u03ba=0.32; 0.30-0.33) for CLT. Inter-rater agreement between attendings was good (\u03ba=0.68; 0.65-0.71) for EPT and moderate (\u03ba=0.46; 0.43-0.50) for CLT. Inter-rater agreement between fellows was moderate (\u03ba=0.48; 0.45-0.50) for EPT and poor to fair (\u03ba=0.20; 0.17-0.24) for CLT. Among all raters, the odds of an incorrect exact esophageal motility diagnosis were 3.3 times higher with CLT assessment than with EPT (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 2.4-4.5; P<0.0001), and the odds of incorrect identification of a major motility disorder were 3.4 times higher with CLT than with EPT (OR: 3.4; 2.4-5.0; P<0.0001).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Superior inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy of esophageal motility diagnoses were demonstrated with analysis using EPT over CLT among our selected raters. On the basis of these findings, EPT may be the preferred assessment modality of esophageal motility.",

The aim of this study was to assess whether the baseline ejection fraction (EF) affects the impact of PVL on mortality after TAVI.\r\nMETHODS: We analyzed 514 consecutive patients with native severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI. Patients were divided into two groups: EF < 40% group (n = 84) and EF \u2265 40% group (n = 430) according to baseline EF.\r\nRESULTS: The mean age was 79.5 years and 49% were male. Patients in the EF < 40% group were younger and with higher logistic EuroSCORE compared to patients in the EF \u2265 40% group. Diabetes, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and renal insufficiency were more prevalent in the EF < 40% group. Patients in the EF <40% group had more mitral regurgitation. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the EF < 40% group (8.3% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.0001). PVL \u2265 moderate was significantly associated with increased 2-year estimated mortality only in the EF <40% group (65% vs. 20%, log-rank p < 0.0001) whereas no difference was seen in the EF \u226540% group (24% vs. 19%, log-rank p = 0.509). Interaction between PVL \u2265 moderate and EF < 40% was statistically significant.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The impact of PVL \u2265 moderate on mortality after TAVI was significant in the EF <40% group but not in the EF \u2265 40% group in our study. Even though operators should aim to minimize PVL in all TAVI patients, special attention is required for patients with reduced baseline EF.",

In many cases, however, people are not actually provided with route directions adhering to these qualities. Yet, often people are still able to successfully navigate to the planned destinations, despite poor or even erroneous direction giving. In this paper, we introduce the concept of defensive wayfinding as the particular type of problem solving people undertake when presented with route directions incongruent with their experience of the environment. We present a systematic investigation of the incompatibilities that may occur between route descriptions and the environment. We note that the content of route directions is produced by the direction giver based on observations of the environment. We develop a classification of the impacts of uncertainty in these observations based on the theory of measurement scales of Stevens [33]. We then relate uncertainty to its impact on route following and the ability of the wayfinder to detect problems during wayfinding. We conclude with a discussion of the impacts of common-sense expectations on the need to engage in defensive wayfinding.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the outcome of IV-MPPT in severe childhood alopecia areata, predominantly with short disease duration.  METHODS  Eighteen children (10 girls, 8 boys) younger than 17 years old (median age 7.7 yrs, range 2.1-16.5 yrs) treated with IV-MPPT for severe childhood alopecia areata in a referral center for pediatric dermatology over 3 years (median disease duration 4 mos, range 1-12 mos) were retrospectively evaluated. Five patients had alopecia areata totalis or universalis and 13 had alopecia multilocularis. The median scalp area affected by alopecia was 60% (range 30%-100%). All patients underwent two or three cycles of IV-MPPT at monthly intervals (maximum 500 mg/day on three consecutive days).  RESULTS  Within 7 months after the last IV-MPPT session, 10 of 18 children had good response (\u226575% of hair regrowth), with eight showing improvement within the first 4 months. Of the remaining eight patients, one had moderate response (50%-74% regrowth), three had poor response (1%-49% regrowth), and four (all with alopecia areata universalis or totalis) had no response. Seven of the initial 10 good responders experienced relapses, with marked hair loss after the last IV-MPPT session. The estimated median time to relapse was 8 months (95% confidence interval 7, 9 mos).  CONCLUSION  IV-MPPT, even early in the course of disease, did not affect long-term outcome of alopecia areata in our group of severely affected patients.",

East Coast fever, caused by the protist Theileria parva, kills one million cattle each year in sub-Saharan Africa, and contributes significantly to hunger and poverty in the region. A highly effective, live, multi-isolate vaccine against T. parva exists, but its component isolates have not been characterized. Here we sequence and compare the three component T. parva stocks within this vaccine, the Muguga Cocktail, namely Muguga, Kiambu5 and Serengeti-transformed, aiming to identify genomic features that contribute to vaccine efficacy.\r\nRESULTS:  We find that Serengeti-transformed, originally isolated from the wildlife carrier, the African Cape buffalo, is remarkably and unexpectedly similar to the Muguga isolate. The 420 detectable non-synonymous SNPs were distributed among only 53 genes, primarily subtelomeric antigens and antigenic families. The Kiambu5 isolate is considerably more divergent, with close to 40,000 SNPs relative to Muguga, including >8,500 non-synonymous mutations distributed among >1,700 (42.5 %) of the predicted genes. These genetic markers of the component stocks can be used to characterize the composition of new batches of the Muguga Cocktail.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Differences among these three isolates, while extensive, represent only a small proportion of the genetic variation in the entire species. Given the efficacy of the Muguga Cocktail in inducing long-lasting protection against infections in the field, our results suggest that whole-organism vaccines against parasitic diseases can be highly efficacious despite considerable genome-wide differences relative to the isolates against which they protect.",

No comparison has been made with different populations.\r\nAIMS: To (i) establish the range of neurological findings in apparently well newborn term Ugandan infants, (ii) compare these findings to published data for equivalent term UK infants and (iii) correlate the neurological findings with perinatal characteristics and cranial ultrasound (cUS) imaging.\r\nMETHODS: Low-risk term Ugandan infants were recruited from the postnatal ward at Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Neurological examination (1) and cUS were performed. The raw data and neurological optimality scores were compared to published data from UK infants (1). Gestational age, postnatal age, sex, maternal parity and HIV status, mode of delivery, birth weight and head circumference were correlated with raw scores.\r\nRESULTS: Ugandan infants showed significantly stronger palmar grasp, better auditory and visual orientation, less irritability and less need for consoling but had poorer tone, poorer quality of spontaneous movements and more abnormal signs than UK infants. No correlation was found between raw scores and cUS findings, gestational age, sex, birth weight and head circumference. Significantly fewer Ugandan infants had optimal scores based on the UK data.\r\nCONCLUSION: The neurological status of low-risk hospital-born term Ugandan infants differs from that of low-risk UK infants. The study findings have implications for assessing normality in Ugandan infants and raise concerns about the use of this UK \"optimality\" score in other research settings. Further work is needed to understand fully the reasons for the differences.",

In all, 522 patients age 15 to 55 years old and presenting with at least 1 conventional high-risk factor were candidates for SCT in first complete remission. Among these, 282 (54%) received a transplant in first complete remission. At 3 years, posttransplant cumulative incidences of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse-free survival (RFS) were estimated at 19.5%, 15.5%, and 64.7%, respectively. Time-dependent analysis did not reveal a significant difference in RFS between SCT and no-SCT cohorts. However, SCT was associated with longer RFS in patients with postinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) \u226510(-3) (hazard ratio, 0.40) but not in good MRD responders. In B-cell precursor ALL, SCT also benefitted patients with focal IKZF1 gene deletion (hazard ratio, 0.42). This article shows that poor early MRD response, in contrast to conventional ALL risk factors, is an excellent tool to identify patients who may benefit from allogeneic SCT in the context of intensified adult ALL therapy.

However, the inherent invasiveness of orthognathic surgery often leads to a high complication rate. Facial fat grafting could be a less invasive method to correct facial deformities.\r\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of microfat grafting for facial contouring.\r\nMETHODS: This retrospective chart review evaluated 166 patients who were treated with microfat grafting for maxillary and/or mandibular hypoplasia. Pretreatment and posttreatment photographs were compared regarding improvement of facial contour, and complications were recorded.\r\nRESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 4 months to 10 years (mean, 2 years 7 months). Thirty-eight percent of the patients had a refill procedure 6 or more months after the first procedure. A majority of the evaluated patients stated that they benefited from the microfat grafting, with ratings of excellent (50%), sufficient (48%), and poor (2%). Complications included visible fat lobules under the lower eyelid skin (7%), which was seen during the first 4 years and was resolved by changing the injection cannulae and technique, and fat resorption, which was seen in all patients, with a clinical range from \u00b115% in the immobile malar area and chin region to \u00b150% in the mobile lip area.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Facial microfat grafting is a valuable alternative to more complicated advancement osetotomies being performed in patients solely for aesthetic reasons. The low morbidity and rapid recovery make facial microfat grafting a welcome tool in the armamentarium of the modern facial aesthetic surgeon.",

On the basis of their histological appearance, they have been traditionally classified as astrocytic, oligodendroglial or ependymal tumours and assigned WHO grades I\u2013IV, which indicate different degrees of malignancy. Tremendous progress in genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling has resulted in new concepts of classifying and treating gliomas. Diffusely infiltrating gliomas in adults are now separated into three overarching tumour groups with distinct natural histories, responses to treatment and outcomes: isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant, 1p/19q co-deleted tumours with mostly oligodendroglial morphology that are associated with the best prognosis; IDH-mutant, 1p/19q non-co-deleted tumours with mostly astrocytic histology that are associated with intermediate outcome; and IDH wild-type, mostly higher WHO grade (III or IV) tumours that are associated with poor prognosis. Gliomas in children are molecularly distinct from those in adults, the majority being WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytomas characterized by circumscribed growth, favourable prognosis and frequent BRAF gene fusions or mutations. Ependymal tumours can be molecularly subdivided into distinct epigenetic subgroups according to location and prognosis. Although surgery, radiotherapy and alkylating agent chemotherapy are still the mainstay of treatment, individually tailored strategies based on tumour-intrinsic dominant signalling pathways and antigenic tumour profiles may ultimately improve outcome.",

After charting the rise of behavioural economics and discussing the key conceptual building blocks of the emerging behavioural mainstream in economics, the paper turns to the marketization of anti-poverty policy in the global South. Based on an analysis of policy documents, project reports and academic interventions, it is argued that the behavioural approach to poverty shifts the focus from the market to the market subject and engages in often thinly veiled attempts at behavioural engineering. This is achieved with the combined work of behavioural economic knowledge and socio-technical market devices.",

In this Opinion, we present the rationale for promulgating an \"Essential Diagnostics List.\" Additionally, we explain the ways in which adopting a vision for \"Health in All Policies\" could link essential diagnostics with robust and timely societal outcomes such as sustainable development, human rights, gender parity, and alleviation of poverty. We do so in three ways. First, we propose the need for a new, \"see through\" taxonomy for knowledge-based innovation as we transition from the material industries (e.g., textiles, plastic, cement, glass) dominant in the 20(th) century to the anticipated knowledge industry of the 21st century. If knowledge is the currency of the present century, then it is sensible to adopt an approach that thoroughly examines scientific knowledge, starting with the production aims, methods, quality, distribution, access, and the ends it purports to serve. Second, we explain that this knowledge trajectory focus on innovation is crucial and applicable across all sectors, including public, private, or public-private partnerships, as it underscores the fact that scientific knowledge is a co-product of technology, human values, and social systems. By making the value systems embedded in scientific design and knowledge co-production transparent, we all stand to benefit from sustainable and transparent science. Third, we appeal to the global health community to consider the necessary qualities of good governance for 21st century organizations that will embark on developing essential diagnostics. These have importance not only for science and knowledge-based innovation, but also for the ways in which we can build open, healthy, and peaceful civil societies today and for future generations.",

Its prevalence remains high in resource poor countries and is likely to increase in the Northern Europe as vaccination rates decrease. Clinical knowledge of this devastating condition, however, is limited. We therefore conducted this multinational survey summarizing experience obtained from more than 500 patients treated by 24 physicians in seven countries. SSPE should be considered in all patients presenting with otherwise unexplained acquired neurological symptoms. In most patients, the diagnosis will be established by the combination of typical clinical symptoms (characteristic repetitive myoclonic jerks), a strong intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to MV and typical electroencephalogram findings (Radermecker complexes). Whereas the therapeutic use of different antiviral (amantadine, ribavirin) and immunomodulatory drugs (isoprinosine, interferons) and of immunoglobulins has been reported repeatedly, optimum application regimen of these drugs has not been established. This is partly due to the absence of common diagnostic and clinical standards focusing on neurological and psychosocial aspects. Carbamazepine, levetiracetam, and clobazam are the drugs most frequently used to control myoclonic jerks. We have established a consensus on essential laboratory and clinical parameters that should facilitate collaborative studies. Those are urgently needed to improve outcome.",

While the therapy of JIA as a whole has benefitted enormously from the introduction of novel therapeutic agents,2 it remains uncertain to what extent these therapies benefit the TMJ specifically. Thus, many practitioners use intra-articular therapy for refractory TMJ arthritis, although concerns about their long-term safety have been raised.3 Herein, we will review the data on systemic and local anti-inflammatory therapy of TMJ arthritis.",

        "document": "Title: G-CSF-regulates macrophage phenotype and associates with poor overall survival in human triple-negative breast cancer\nAbstract: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been implicated in the promotion of breast cancer growth and metastasis, and a strong infiltration by TAMs has been associated with estrogen receptor-negative tumors and poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these observations are unclear. We investigated macrophage activation in response to co-culture with several breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF-7, BT-474, SKBR-3, Cal-51 and MDA-MB-231) and found that high granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) secretion by the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 gave rise to immunosuppressive HLA-DRlo macrophages that promoted migration of breast cancer cells via secretion of TGF-\u03b1. In human breast cancer samples (n=548), G-CSF was highly expressed in TNBC (P<0.001) and associated with CD163+ macrophages (P<0.0001), poorer overall survival (P=0.021) and significantly increased numbers of TGF-\u03b1+ cells. While G-CSF blockade in the 4T1 mammary tumor model promoted maturation of MHCIIhi blood monocytes and TAMs and significantly reduced lung metastasis, anti-CSF-1R treatment promoted MHCIIloF4/80hiMRhi anti-inflammatory TAMs and enhanced lung metastasis in the presence of high G-CSF levels. Combined anti-G-CSF and anti-CSF-1R therapy significantly increased lymph node metastases, possibly via depletion of the so-called \u201cgate-keeper\u201d subcapsular sinus macrophages. These results indicate that G-CSF promotes the anti-inflammatory phenotype of tumor-induced macrophages when CSF-1R is inhibited and therefore caution against the use of M-CSF/CSF-1R targeting agents in tumors with high G-CSF expression.",

        "document": "Title: Heavy Smoking Is More Strongly Associated with General Unhealthy Lifestyle than Obesity and Underweight\nAbstract: BACKGROUND  Smoking and obesity are major causes of non-communicable diseases. We investigated the associations of heavy smoking, obesity, and underweight with general lifestyle to infer which of these risk groups has the most unfavourable lifestyle.  METHODS  We used data from the population-based cross-sectional Swiss Health Survey (5 rounds 1992-2012), comprising 85,575 individuals aged\u226518 years. Height, weight, smoking, diet, alcohol intake and physical activity were self-reported. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to analyse differences in lifestyle between the combinations of body mass index (BMI) category and smoking status.  RESULTS  Compared to normal-weight never smokers (reference), individuals who were normal-weight, obese, or underweight and smoked heavily at the same time had a poorer general lifestyle. The lifestyle of obese and underweight never smokers differed less from reference. Regardless of BMI category, in heavy smoking men and women the fruit and vegetable consumption was lower (e.g. obese heavy smoking men: relative risk ratio (RRR) 1.69 [95% confidence interval 1.30;2.21]) and high alcohol intake was more common (e.g. normal-weight heavy smoking women 5.51 [3.71;8.20]). In both sexes, physical inactivity was observed more often in heavy smokers and obese or underweight (e.g. underweight never smoking 1.29 [1.08;1.54] and heavy smoking women 2.02 [1.33;3.08]). A decrease of smoking prevalence was observed over time in normal-weight, but not in obese individuals.  CONCLUSIONS  Unhealthy general lifestyle was associated with both heavy smoking and BMI extremes, but we observed a stronger association for heavy smoking. Future smoking prevention measures should pay attention to improvement of general lifestyle and co-occurrence with obesity and underweight.",

Therefore, a culturally adapted version of a Male Genital Self-Image Scale (MGSIS) could help health professionals understand this concept and its associated correlates.\r\nAIM: To translate the original English version of the MGSIS into Persian and to assess the psychometric properties of this culturally adapted version (MGSIS-I) for use in Iranian men.\r\nMETHODS: In total, 1,784 men were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Backward and forward translations of the MGSIS were used to produce the culturally adapted version. Reliability of the MGSIS-I was assessed using Cronbach \u03b1 and intra-class correlation coefficients. Divergent and convergent validities were examined using Pearson correlation and known-group validity was assessed in subgroups of participants with different sociodemographic statuses. Factor validity of the scale was investigated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.\r\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic information, the International Index of Erectile Function, the Body Appreciation Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the MGSIS.\r\nRESULTS: Mean age of participants was 38.13 years (SD\u00a0= 11.45) and all men were married. Cronbach \u03b1 of the MGSIS-I was 0.89 and interclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.70 to 0.94. Significant correlations were found between the MGSIS-I and the International Index of Erectile Function (P < .01), whereas correlation of the scale with non-similar scales was lower than with similar scale (confirming convergent and divergent validity). The scale could differentiate between subgroups in age, smoking status, and income (known-group validity). A single-factor solution that explained 70% variance of the scale was explored using exploratory factor analysis (confirming uni-dimensionality); confirmatory factor analysis indicated better fitness for the five-item version than the seven-item version of the MGSIS-I (root mean square error of approximation\u00a0= 0.05, comparative fit index > 1.00 vs root mean square error of approximation\u00a0= 0.10, comparative fit index > 0.97, respectively).\r\nCONCLUSION: The MGSIS-I is a useful instrument to assess genital self-image in Iranian men, a concept that has been associated with sexual function. Further investigation is needed to identify the applicability of the scale in other cultures or populations.",

This volume consists of a series of essays that explore how ancient plant, animal, and human remains should be studied, and how, when they are integrated with texts, images, and artefacts, they can contribute to our understanding of the history, environment, and culture of ancient Egypt in a holistic manner.\r\nTopics covered in this volume relating to human remains include analyses of royal, elite and poor cemeteries of different eras, case studies on specific mummies, identification of different diseases in human remains, an overview of the state of palaeopathology in Egypt, how to analyse burials to establish season of death, the use of bodies to elucidate life stories, the potential of visceral remains in identifying individuals as well as diseases that they might have had, and a protocol for studying mummies. Faunal remains are represented by a study of a canine cemetery and a discussion of cat species that were mummified, and dendroarchaeology is represented by an overview of its potentials and pitfalls for dating Egyptian remains and revising its chronology.\r\nLeading international specialists from varied disciplines including physical anthropology, radiology, archaeozoology, Egyptology, and dendrochronology have contributed to this groundbreaking volume of essays that will no doubt provide much fodder for thought, and will be of interest to scholars and laypeople alike.",

        "document": "Title: Consumer mobility in social health insurance markets: a five-country comparison\nAbstract: During the 1990s, the social health insurance schemes of Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and Israel were significantly reformed by the introduction of freedom of choice (open enrolment) of health insurer. This was introduced alongside a system of risk adjustment to compensate health insurers for enrolees with predictable high medical expenses. Despite the similarity in the health insurance reforms in these countries, we find that both the rationale behind these reforms and their impact on consumer choice vary widely.\r\n\r\nIn this article we seek to explain the observed variation in switching rates by cross-country comparison of the potential determinants of health insurer choice. We conclude that differences in choice setting, and in the net benefits of switching, offer a plausible explanation for the large differences in consumer mobility.\r\n\r\nFinally, we discuss the policy implications of our cross-country comparison. We argue that the optimal switching rate crucially depends on the goals of the reforms and the quality of the risk-adjustment system. In view of this, we conclude that switching rates are currently too low in the Netherlands, and an active government policy to encourage consumer mobility seems warranted. In Germany and Switzerland, high switching rates call for an improvement of the rather poor risk-adjustment systems. Given low switching rates in Israel and Belgium, improving risk adjustment is less urgent, but still required in the long run.",

The effects of IP protection on growth can be either positive or negative, depending on the distribution of income and wealth. Given that increasing the length of IP protection increases growth, poorer households prefer a shorter length of protection than richer ones.",

Socio-demographic information, disease characteristics, and self-assessment questionnaires-the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R)-were collected.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 1902 patients from 60 countries were included. HRQoL appeared to be impaired in SSc, particularly for physical health (PCS, mean \u00b1 SD = 43.4 \u00b1 23.4). SSc patients also had strong perceptions about the chronic nature and negative consequence of the disease, and experienced negative emotions due to SSc. Patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc had a poorer HRQoL than those with limited cutaneous SSc, for both physical (PCS, mean \u00b1 SD = 46.6 \u00b1 23.7 vs. 39.8 \u00b1 22.3; p < 0.0001) and mental components (MCS, mean \u00b1 SD = 53.8 \u00b1 23.0 vs. 50.3 \u00b1 23.2; p = 0.003). Late-stage SSc patients were more likely to perceive their disease chronic (p < 0.0001), less controllable (p = 0.03) and with more consequences (p = 0.008), but they had a better understanding of their disease and experienced fewer negative emotions. Raynaud's phenomenon and gastrointestinal complications were the organ involvements with the greatest impact on QoL, they were the two variables associated with the most negative perception of illness severity.\r\nCONCLUSION: This study, performed on the largest group ever set up for this purpose, confirms the major impact on QoL and the negative perceptions of their disease expressed by SSc patients. However, the perception of this illness tended to improve with disease duration, suggesting that patients find effective coping strategies.",

Stratification according to WHO grade showed a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 32.2 months for grade I tumors, 7.2 for grade II, and 2.1 for grade III. PFS at 6 months was 100% for grade I, 57% for grade II, and 0% for grade III. Median overall survival was 17.2 months in WHO grade III patients and not reached for WHO I and II at a median follow-up of 20 months. In the analysis of single meningioma lesions, maximal and mean standardized uptake values in pretherapeutic (68)Ga-DOTATOC/-TATE PET/CT were significantly higher in those lesions with radiographic stability after 6 months. In line with this, high expression of SSTR via immunohistochemistry was associated with PFS >6 months.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: SSTR-targeted radionuclide treatment has activity in a subset of patients with meningioma. Expression of SSTR via immunohistochemistry or radionuclide uptake might serve as a predictive biomarker for outcome to facilitate individualized treatment optimization in patients with uni- and multifocal meningiomas.",

One of the factors that may assist us in predicting survival and allow us to adjust our treatment strategies is the presence of tumor hypoxia. In this overview we aim to evaluate the current evidence and potential clinical relevance of tumor hypoxia in head and neck cancer according to an extensive search of current literature. An abundance of evidence and often contradictory evidence is found in the literature. Contradictions and comparisons are difficult to judge as criteria and methodologies differ greatly, furthermore few prospective observational studies exist for verification in pre-clinical studies. Despite these discrepancies there is clear evidence of associations between prognosis and poor tumor oxygenation biomarkers such as HIF-1\u03b1, GLUT-1 and lactate, though these associations are not exclusive. The use of genetic markers is expanding and will probably lead to significantly more and complex evidence. The lack of oxygenation in head and neck tumors is of paramount importance for the prediction of treatment outcomes and prognosis. Despite the wide array of conflicting evidence, the drive towards non-invasive prediction of tumor hypoxia should continue.",

Flying performance was assessed using a flight simulator, psychomotor function was evaluated, sleep and wake cycles were monitored, and symptoms and moods were assessed using standardized questionnaires. A simplified postural sway meter recorded sway in three test positions. In the mefloquine loading dose phase, there was one withdrawal due to dizziness, diarrhea, and flu-like symptoms, and three volunteers reported nonserious, sleep-related adverse events. There was no significant difference in flying performance, psychomotor functions, or mean sway for any test position. Nonsignificant reductions in mean total nocturnal sleep (mefloquine = 450 min versus placebo = 484 min) and poorer sleep quality were detected in the mefloquine phases.

From an inception cohort of patients with juvenile-onset IDDM that now has 15-21 yr diabetes duration, the patients with PDR (cases, n = 74) were selected for study along with a random sample of the patients in the cohort without PDR (control subjects, n = 88). The risk of PDR was associated with poor glycemic control during the first 12 yr of diabetes. Relative to patients in the first quartile of the index of hyperglycemia, those in higher quartiles and nonattenders had a four- to fivefold risk of developing PDR. A striking relationship with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) was found. Relative to patients without CAN, patients with significant and mild CAN had odds ratios of 77.5 and 34.6, respectively. Patients with albumin excretion rates greater than 30 micrograms/min had moderately increased risk of PDR (ranging from 4-fold for microalbuminuria to 7-fold for proteinuria). In contrast, patients with impaired renal function had an extremely high risk of PDR. All 20 of these patients were cases, therefore the odds ratio was infinite. All three factors (poor glycemic control, CAN, and various stages of nephropathy) were associated with PDR in multiple logistic regression analysis. However, in models including glycemic control, the association between microalbuminuria or proteinuria and PDR was weakened. In conclusion, our findings are consistent with a hypothesis that the level of glycemia is a primary determinant of early-onset PDR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "document": "Title: Circulating activin A is a novel prognostic biomarker in malignant pleural mesothelioma - A multi-institutional study\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION  The deregulation of activin expression is often observed in various malignancies. Previous studies indicate that activin A plays a protumourigenic role in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The aim of the study was to evaluate circulating activin A level as a biomarker in MPM.  METHODS  Plasma samples were collected from 129 MPM patients in four institutions at the time of diagnosis or before surgical resection. Samples from 45 healthy individuals and from 16 patients with non-malignant pleural diseases served as controls. Circulating activin A was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and correlated to clinicopathological variables.  RESULTS  Plasma activin A level was significantly elevated in MPM patients (862 \u00b1 83 pg/ml) when compared to healthy controls (391 \u00b1 21 pg/ml; P < 0.0001). Patients with pleuritis or fibrosis only showed a modest increase (versus controls; 625 \u00b1 95 pg/ml; P = 0.0067). Sarcomatoid (n = 10, 1629 \u00b1 202 pg/ml, P = 0.0019) and biphasic (n = 23, 1164 \u00b1 233 pg/ml, P = 0.0188) morphology were associated with high activin A levels when compared to epithelioid histology (n = 94, 712 \u00b1 75 pg/ml). The tumour volume showed a positive correlation with increased circulating activin A levels. MPM patients with below median activin A levels had a significantly longer overall survival when compared to those with high activin A levels (median survival 735 versus 365 d, P < 0.0001). Importantly, circulating activin A levels were exclusively prognostic in epithelioid MPM.  CONCLUSIONS  Our findings suggest that the measurement of circulating activin A may support the histological classification of MPM and at the same time help to identify epithelioid MPM patients with poor prognosis.",

In these countries the human burden of disease is often underestimated due to insufficient monitoring because of insufficient funding. Quantification of the impact of zoonoses helps in prioritizing healthcare needs. Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with 48% of the population employed in agriculture and one third of the population living below the poverty line.\r\nMethodology/Principal Findings\r\nWe have assessed the burden of zoonoses in Kyrgyzstan by conducting a systematic review. We have used the collected data to estimate the burden of ZDs and addressed the underestimation in officially reported disease incidence. The estimated incidences of the ZDs were used to calculate incidence-based Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). This standardized health gap measure enhances comparability between injuries and diseases. The combined burden for alveolar echinococcosis, cystic echinococcosis, brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, congenital toxoplasmosis, non-typhoidal salmonellosis and rabies in Kyrgyzstan in 2013 was 35,209 DALYs [95% Uncertainty interval (UI):13,413\u201383,777]; 576 deaths [95% UI: 279\u20131,168] were attributed to these infections. We estimate a combined median incidence of ZDs of 141,583 cases [95% UI: 33,912\u2013250,924] in 2013. The highest burden was caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella and Echinococcus multilocularis, respectively 14,792 DALYs [95% UI: 3,966\u201341,532] and 11,915 DALYs [95% UI: 4,705\u201327,114] per year.\r\nConclusion/Significance\r\nThe health impact of zoonoses in Kyrgyzstan is substantial, comparable to that of HIV. Community-based surveillance studies and hospital-based registration of all occurrences of zoonoses would increase the accuracy of the estimates.",

Thermostabilisation of GPCRs by introduction of stabilising mutations has been a key factor to overcome these limitations. However, labelled ligands with sufficient affinity, which are required for selective binding to the correctly folded receptor, are often not available. Here we describe a novel procedure to improve receptor expression and stability in a generic way, independent of specific ligands, by means of directed evolution in E. coli. We have engineered a homogenous fluorescent reporter assay that only detects receptors which are correctly integrated into the inner cell membrane and, thus, discriminates functional from non-functional receptor species. When we combined this method with a directed evolution procedure we obtained highly expressing mutants of the neurotensin receptor 1 with greatly improved thermostability. By this procedure receptors with poor expression and/or low stability, for which no ligands or only ones with poor binding properties are available, can now be generated in quantities allowing detailed structural and biophysical analysis.",

We aimed to evaluate the 8-year sustainability of a successful intervention to reduce urinary tract infections (UTIs) through restriction of urinary catheter (UC) use in an orthopedic surgical population.  METHODS  Prospective UTI surveillance from November 2009-January 2010 was conducted to compare the results against the 2-year sustainability assessment performed in 2004. Semistructured staff interviews focused on UC indication, training, insertion techniques, and recall of the former intervention.  RESULTS  A total of 336 consecutive patients were included (median age, 63 years; range, 16-95 years; 55% women). A UC was placed in 17.6% of patients (operating room [OR], 10.1%; postanesthesia care unit [PACU], 3.6%; surgical wards [SW], 3.9%) compared with 20.0% in 2004 (OR, 15.7%; PACU, 1.0%; SW, 3.7%). The incidence rate of UTI was 2.4 per 1,000 patient-days in 2010 versus 2.6 per 1,000 patient-days in 2004; adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-2.76; P\u2009=\u2009.67. The qualitative inquiry demonstrated poor recall of the intervention and knowledge of guidelines except in the OR, where we identified a champion leader.  DISCUSSION  The intervention effect was sustained with regard to overall UTI rate and UC placement in the OR, but less in the PACU and SW.  CONCLUSIONS  Continuous leadership of a single opinion leader in a pivotal position can contribute critically to sustainability.",

Long chemotherapy-free intervals (CFI) may lead to tumor progression and poor oncological outcomes.\r\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the length of CFI on oncological outcome in patients undergoing TSH for CRLM.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 74 patients suffering from bilobar CRLM who underwent ALPPS (associating liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy; n\u00a0=\u00a043) or conventional TSH (n\u00a0=\u00a031) at two tertiary centers were investigated. The impact of CFI on long-term outcomes was analyzed by univariable and multivariable analysis.\r\nRESULTS: Preoperative chemotherapy was administered in 91\u00a0% (67/74) of patients, and chemotherapy was resumed postoperatively in 69\u00a0% (44/64) of patients who completed TSH. The use of postoperative chemotherapy was significantly associated with improved mean overall survival (36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 vs. 13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0months; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Overall, the median CFI from surgery to postoperative chemotherapy was 16\u00a0weeks (interquartile range 11-31) and was significantly shorter in the ALPPS group when compared with the conventional TSH group (10 vs. 21\u00a0weeks; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Multivariable analysis revealed a CFI\u00a0\u2264\u00a010\u00a0weeks as an independent factor associated with improved overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and disease-free survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010).\r\nCONCLUSION: A short CFI is associated with improved oncological outcome in patients undergoing TSH for CRLM.

However, no study has opted to test whether a short self-report personality inventory may comprehensively inform health policy. METHODS: Data were taken from a population-based epidemiologic survey in Zurich, Switzerland, conducted from 2010-2012. A short form of the Big Five Inventory was completed by n=1155 participants (54.4% women; mean age=29.6 years), while health-related outcomes were taken from a comprehensive semi-structured clinical interview. A convenience subsample averaging n=171 participants additionally provided laboratory measures and n=133 were subsequently followed-up at least once over a maximal period of 6 months. RESULTS: Personality traits, in particular high neuroticism and low conscientiousness, related significantly to poor environmental resources such as low social support (R(2)=0.071), health-impairing behaviours such as cannabis use (R(2)=0.071), and psychopathology, including negative affect (R(2)=0.269) and various mental disorders (R(2)=0.060-0.195). The proportion of total variance explained was R(2)=0.339 in persons with three or more mental disorders. Personality significantly related to some laboratory measures including total cholesterol (R(2)=0.095) and C-Reactive Protein (R(2)=0.062). Finally, personality prospectively predicted global psychopathological distress and vegetative symptoms over a 6-month observation period. CONCLUSIONS: Personality relates consistently to poor socio-environmental resources, health-impairing behaviours and psychopathology. We also found some evidence for an association with metabolic and immune functions that are assumed to influence health. A short personality inventory could provide valuable information for preventive medicine when used as a means to screen entire populations for distinct risk exposure, in particular with respect to psychopathology.",

The benefit of treatment for the mother has to be balanced with the prenatal and postnatal risk for the child. To gain reasonable medical evidence, pregnancy registries have to include an adequate and representative number of pregnant women with epilepsy. They will have to observe women during pregnancy and delivery, as well as the foetus respectively the child during its development. In addition, different health care providers have to coordinate their efforts, sharing data while preserving the mother privacy interests. Given these requirements, the multitude of antiepileptic drugs, and the poor knowledge concerning the important implications of the adopted therapy by potential mothers with epilepsy, the rate of patient inclusion in pregnancy registries is still insufficient to provide reliable recommendations for an appropriate medical management. An ethical approach as outlined here aims to overcome some of these obstacles.",

These studies often use mortality rates in middle and old age. We used poverty level rankings of groups of U.S. counties as a basis for analyzing inequality in mortality for all age groups in 1990, 2000, and 2010. Consistent with previous studies, we found increasing inequality in mortality at older ages. For children and young adults below age 20, however, we found strong mortality improvements that were most pronounced in poorer counties, implying a strong decrease in mortality inequality. These younger cohorts will form the future adult U.S. population, so this research suggests that inequality in old-age mortality is likely to decline.",

Focusing on groups of counties ranked by their poverty rates, we show that gains in life expectancy at birth have actually been relatively equally distributed between rich and poor areas. Analysts who have concluded that inequality in life expectancy is increasing have generally focused on life expectancy at age 40 to 50. This observation suggests that it is important to examine trends in mortality for younger and older ages separately. Turning to an analysis of age-specific mortality rates, we show that among adults age 50 and over, mortality has declined more quickly in richer areas than in poorer ones, resulting in increased inequality in mortality. This finding is consistent with previous research on the subject. However, among children, mortality has been falling more quickly in poorer areas with the result that inequality in mortality has fallen substantially over time. We also show that there have been stunning declines in mortality rates for African Americans between 1990 and 2010, especially for black men. Finally we offer some hypotheses about causes for the results we see, including a discussion of differential smoking patterns by age and socioeconomic status.",

However, donors often condition foreign aid on reforms in recipient states. We argue that when those conditions for reform focus on participative processes and government accountability, they positively affect democratization. We evaluate our claim based on different types of World Bank and IMF lending programs for a panel of 100 low- and middle-income countries over the years 1980\u20132011. Our results suggest that aid positively affects democratization when it strengthens domestic accountability mechanisms and thereby reduces its fungibility for recipients.

Parallel measurements were recorded during [1] baseline, [2] hypotension, [3] hypertension, and [4] hyperventilation. Thereafter, protocol points 1 through 4 were repeated once. The Spearman correlation (rs), Bland-Altman plot, concordance rate, and coefficient of variation were used for statistical analysis.\r\nResults: There was poor agreement between 56 pairs of absolute CBF values (rs = 0.52, P < .001). The mean bias was 10.7 ml/100 g/min with limits of agreement of 233.0 to\u00b754.3 ml/100 g/min. The analysis of 49 pairs of changes in CBF showed a good\u00b7correlation (rs = 0.83, P <.001), and the concordance rate was 93.3%. The coefficient of variation from repeated measurements under comparable physiological conditions was 51.6% for the QFlow 500 Probe and 12.9% for the NeMo Probe.\r\nConclusion: Absolute CBF values obtained with the NeMo Probe and QFlow 500 Probe cannot be interpreted as equivalent.  However, the NeMo Probe provides acceptable trending ability and reproducibility from repeated measurements, whereas the  reproducibility of the QFlow 500 Probe was poor. Future clinical studies are warranted to evaluate the NeMo Probe in the setting of acute brain injury.",

        "document": "Title: Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation for Treating Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction: A Systematic Review\nAbstract: CONTEXT  Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a promising therapy for non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and might also be a valuable option in patients with an underlying neurological disorder.  OBJECTIVE  We systematically reviewed all available evidence on the efficacy and safety of TENS for treating neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction.  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION  The review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement.  EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS  After screening 1943 articles, 22 studies (two randomised controlled trials, 14 prospective cohort studies, five retrospective case series, and one case report) enrolling 450 patients were included. Eleven studies reported on acute TENS and 11 on chronic TENS. In acute TENS and chronic TENS, the mean increase of maximum cystometric capacity ranged from 69ml to 163ml and from 4ml to 156ml, the mean change of bladder volume at first detrusor overactivity from a decrease of 13ml to an increase of 175ml and from an increase of 10ml to 120ml, a mean decrease of maximum detrusor pressure at first detrusor overactivity from 18 cmH20 to 72 cmH20 and 8 cmH20, and a mean decrease of maximum storage detrusor pressure from 20 cmH20 to 58 cmH2O and from 3 cmH20 to 8 cmH2O, respectively. In chronic TENS, a mean decrease in the number of voids and leakages per 24h ranged from 1 to 3 and from 0 to 4, a mean increase of maximum flow rate from 2ml/s to 7ml/s, and a mean change of postvoid residual from an increase of 26ml to a decrease of 85ml. No TENS-related serious adverse events have been reported. Risk of bias and confounding was high in most studies.  CONCLUSIONS  Although preliminary data suggest TENS might be effective and safe for treating neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, the evidence base is poor and more reliable data from well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to make definitive conclusions.  PATIENT SUMMARY  Early data suggest that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation might be effective and safe for treating neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, but more reliable evidence is required.",

BACKGROUND  The Z\u00fcMAX is a novel domain-specific cognitive assessment tool to screen for disturbances in neuropsychological function. The test can be used in stroke rehabilitation to estimate severity of cognitive impairment. Because evidence for validity and reliability is lacking, the tool's clinical use is limited.  METHODS  We administered the Z\u00fcMAX in a test-retest design to 33 community-dwelling stroke survivors, and once to 35 healthy controls matched for age and sex.  RESULTS  We found significant group differences in subscores for the cognitive domains of executive functions and language as well as total score (P=0.001 to 0.004); we did not find group differences for the domains of praxia (defined as the ability to perform purposeful actions), visual perception and construction, or learning and memory. Test-retest reliability of the total score was good (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.81), with the individual domain subscores ranging from poor to fair (0.59 to 0.79). The Z\u00fcMAX could detect changes in patients with low smallest detectable differences in executive functions, language, and praxia (0.05 to 1.49) and total score (0.09).  CONCLUSION  The Z\u00fcMAX has moderate to good test-retest reliability. Furthermore, the tool might discriminate between healthy persons and chronic stroke survivors on three of five subscales. The Z\u00fcMAX shows promise in measuring neuropsychological disturbances in stroke survivors; however, further trials are required with larger samples.",

        "document": "Title: Optimizing treatment success in multiple sclerosis\nAbstract: Despite important advances in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) over recent years, the introduction of several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), the burden of progressive disability and premature mortality associated with the condition remains substantial. This burden, together with the high healthcare and societal costs associated with MS, creates a compelling case for early treatment optimization with highly efficacious therapies. Often, patients receive several first-line therapies, while more recent and in part more effective treatments are still being introduced only after these have failed. However, with the availability of highly efficacious therapies, a novel treatment strategy has emerged, where the aim is to achieve no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). Achieving NEDA necessitates regular monitoring of relapses, disability and functionality. However, there is only a poor correlation between conventional magnetic resonance imaging measures like T2 hyperintense lesion burden and the level of clinical disability. Hence, MRI-based measures of brain atrophy have emerged in recent years potentially reflecting the magnitude of MS-related neuroaxonal damage. Currently available DMTs differ markedly in their effects on brain atrophy: some, such as fingolimod, have been shown to significantly slow brain volume loss, compared to placebo, whereas others have shown either no, inconsistent, or delayed effects. In addition to regular monitoring, treatment optimization also requires early intervention with efficacious therapies, because accumulating evidence shows that effective intervention during a limited period early in the course of MS is critical for maintaining neurological function and preventing subsequent disability. Together, the advent of new MS therapies and evolving management strategies offer exciting new opportunities to optimize treatment outcomes.",

Reasons for low service use rates are still incompletely understood. In this longitudinal, population-based study, we investigated the influence of mental health literacy, attitudes toward mental health services, and perceived need for treatment at baseline on actual service use during a 6-month follow-up period, controlling for sociodemographic variables, symptom level, and a history of lifetime mental health service use. Positive attitudes to mental health care, higher mental health literacy, and more perceived need at baseline significantly predicted use of psychotherapy during the follow-up period. Greater perceived need for treatment and better literacy at baseline were predictive of taking psychiatric medication during the following 6 months. Our findings suggest that mental health literacy, attitudes to treatment, and perceived need may be targets for interventions to increase mental health service use.",

        "document": "Title: Outcomes of acute kidney injury in children and adults in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review\nAbstract: BACKGROUND  Access to diagnosis and dialysis for acute kidney injury can be life-saving, but can be prohibitively expensive in low-income settings. The burden of acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan Africa is presumably high but remains unknown. We did a systematic review to assess outcomes of acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan Africa and identify barriers to care.  METHODS  We searched PubMed, African Journals Online, WHO Global Health Library, and Web of Science for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and Nov 30, 2014. We scored studies, and all were of medium-to-low quality. We made a pragmatic decision to include all studies to best reflect reality, and did a descriptive analysis of extracted data. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015015690.  FINDINGS  We identified 3881 records, of which 41 met inclusion criteria, including 1403 adult patients and 1937 paediatric patients. Acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan Africa is severe, with 1042 (66%) of 1572 children and 178 (70%) 253 of adults needing dialysis in studies reporting dialysis need. Only 666 (64%) of 1042 children (across 11 studies) and 58 (33%) of 178 adults (across four studies) received dialysis when needed. Overall mortality was 34% in children and 32% in adults, but rose to 73% in children and 86% in adults when dialysis was needed but not received. Major barriers to access to care were out-of-pocket costs, erratic hospital resources, late presentation, and female sex.  INTERPRETATION  Patients in these studies are those with resources to access care. In view of overall study quality, data interpretation should be cautious, but high mortality and poor access to dialysis are concerning. The global scarcity of resources among patients and health centres highlights the need for a health-system-wide approach to prevention and management of acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan Africa.",

In the present study, we demonstrate that SIVmac239Delta3 is pathogenic in most vaccinated adult monkeys, given enough time.\r\nMETHODS: Eleven rhesus macaques vaccinated as adults with SIVmac239Delta3 were followed for extended periods (up to 6.8 years).\r\nRESULTS: We found signs of immune dysregulation in all 11 adult vaccinees. All animals developed persistently inverted CD4 : CD8 T-cell ratios, seven (64%) had persistent recurrent viremia, and six (55%) had decreased CD4 T-cell counts (< 500 x 10 cells/l). Further signs included low CD4CD29 lymphocyte subsets, loss of anti-Gag antibodies, anemia, thrombocytopenia, wasting, and opportunistic infections. Two adult vaccinees (18%) subsequently developed AIDS. Development of chronic, recurrent viremia with plasma viral RNA loads > or = 10 copies/ml and cytoviremia was a poor prognostic sign.\r\nCONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that with time, a live attenuated, multiply deleted SIV vaccine can cause immune dysregulation in most vaccine recipients, even in initially immune competent, healthy adults. Immune dysfunction can progress to full AIDS. However, pathogenic effects became evident only several years after vaccination. Thus, mass vaccination of humans with similarly constructed live attenuated HIV vaccines, recently suggested for countries with high HIV-1 transmission rates, seems contraindicated.",

There is a large variability in motor recovery between patients, and a need to optimize therapies by exploiting cerebral plasticity and recovery mechanisms. This retrospective study aims to identify tract-based markers that could serve as predictors of functional outcome following rehabilitation.\r\nMETHODS: Twenty-nine children with traumatic brain injury (n\u00a0=\u00a014) or stroke (n\u00a0=\u00a015) underwent a 3\u00a0T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurement, including Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) between admission to the Hospital and onset of rehabilitation therapy at the Rehabilitation Centre. The Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM) was routinely applied at admission and discharge from the Rehabilitation Centre. Distinguishing between children with good versus poor functional independence was performed using ROC-analysis. A non-parametric partial correlation analysis between the DTI and WeeFIM motor scores was performed with age, time in rehabilitation, and time of MRI scan after injury as covariates.\r\nRESULTS: Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) from the DTI in the ipsilesional corticospinal-tract provided the highest predictive accuracy (sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a095\u00a0%, specificity\u00a0=\u00a078\u00a0%, Youden Index\u00a0=\u00a00.73, Area under the curve\u00a0=\u00a00.9), in comparison to the lesion volume or other clinical variables. Mean FA of the ipsilesional corticospinal-tract correlated positively with the WeeFIM discharge motor scores (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.547, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Prediction was poorer for the lesion volume or Glasgow Coma Scale.\r\nCONCLUSION: The results suggest that DTI data could improve the prediction of functional outcome after rehabilitation in children and adolescents with stroke or traumatic brain injury. Specifically, mean FA shows the highest predictive accuracy in comparison to lesion volume or clinical scales.",

The aim of this prospective observational study was to describe outcome and risk factors in 115 patients born 1995-2001. All prenatally diagnosed children were stratified into low- and high-risk group and followed postnatally clinically and by imaging at defined endpoints. Risk factors were evaluated using odds ratios. Neonatal diagnosis included pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (n\u2009=\u200933), vesicoureteral reflux (n\u2009=\u200927), solitary mild pelvic dilatation (postnatal anteroposterior diameter 5-10\u00a0mm; n\u2009=\u200925), and further diagnosis as primary obstructive megaureter, unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney, renal dysplasia and posterior urethral valves. In 38 children with prenatal isolated hydronephrosis, ultrasound normalized at median age of 1.2\u00a0years (range 0.1-9). Surgery was performed in 34 children at median age of 0.4\u00a0years (0.1-10.8). Persistent renal anomalies without surgery were present in 43 children and followed in 36 for median time of 16\u00a0years (12.2-18). Oligohydramnios and postnatal bilateral anomalies were significantly associated with surgery and impaired renal function.\r\nCONCLUSION The majority of children had a favourable postnatal outcome, in particular children with prenatally low risk, i.e. isolated uni- or bilateral hydronephrosis. Oligohydramnios and postnatal bilateral anomalies were risk factors for non-favourable outcome.\r\nWHAT IS KNOWN  In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract significantly poorer outcome is known in patients with bilateral renal hypoplasia or solitary kidney associated with posterior urethral valves. \u2022 Other factors as proteinuria and vesicoureteral reflux were associated with a higher risk of progression to chronic renal failure in these patients. What is New: \u2022 Unlike other studies giving us above-mentioned information, we included all patients with any kind of prenatally diagnosed congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. Our\u00a0study shows long-term follow up (median 16\u00a0years, range 12.2-18\u00a0years), especially in patients not needing surgery, but with persistent anomalies. \u2022 During postnatal long-term follow up (median 2.2\u00a0years, range 0.1-18\u00a0years) one third each showed normalization, need of surgery or persistence of anomalies without need of surgery. Our study revealed a good prognosis in the majority of these children, in particular with prenatally low risk, i.e. isolated uni- or bilateral hydronephrosis, and revealed oligohydramnios and postnatal bilateral anomalies as risk factors for a non-favourable outcome, defined as need of surgery, persistent anomalies with impaired renal function, end stage renal failure or death.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS  All surviving Swiss live-born children below 30weeks of gestation during the year 2000 (290 subjects) were contacted at age 12years, together with their parents (262 families). HRQoL of the study children was assessed using both the Kidscreen-27 (KS-27) self- and parent forms. Neonatal data of the cohort were prospectively collected.  RESULTS  Among the contacted families, 176 returned the complete set of questionnaires for 194 adolescents (67%): 100 (51%) females, mean (range) gestational age was 27.8 (24.1-29.9) weeks, birth weight 1025 (420-1730) grams, mean age at assessment 12.0 (11.0-13.0) years. Included children had similar neonatal and socio-demographic characteristics as non-responders. Average self- and parent-reported HRQoL of former preterms was similar to Swiss KS-27 norms. According to the multivariable models (r(2)=0.2), surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, severe neurodevelopment impairment were negatively associated with both self- and parent-reported HRQoL.  CONCLUSIONS  HRQoL in this population-based cohort of adolescents born very preterm is good. Surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, severe neurodevelopment impairment were identified as predictors of poorer HRQoL using multivariable models, explaining however only a low proportion of variance in HRQoL.",

We retrospectively reviewed 247 eyes of 222 patients who underwent Baerveldt implantations at one of two academic institutions. Postoperative vision loss at 6 months following surgery was categorized as mild-to-moderate versus severe and long-term versus transient. Long-term vision loss, defined as 3 or more lines of Snellen visual acuity (VA) loss compared with preoperative VA, occurred in 63 of 247 eyes (25.5%), and 39 had mild-to-moderate and 24 had severe loss. Of these 63 eyes, 18 had no identifiable cause of vision loss. On multivariate analysis, poorer Snellen VA on postoperative day 1 (POD1) was found to be a significant risk factor for long-term vision loss (). In addition, the negative change in preoperative versus POD1 Snellen VA () and the presence of split fixation involving the inferonasal quadrant on preoperative Humphrey visual field () were significant risk factors for snuff-out. Transient vision loss occurred in 76 of 242 eyes (30.8%). In conclusion, vision loss is not uncommon after Baerveldt surgery, with snuff-out occurring in 2.4% of cases in this study.",

The aims of this study were to determine the 1-year adherence to oral antihyperglycemic drugs (OADs) and to predict the risk of subsequent health outcomes among (non)adherent patients with diabetes.Using a large Swiss healthcare claims database from 2011 to 2014, we identified all patients aged \u226518 years with diabetes and treated with at least 1 OAD prescription. Adherence to OADs was measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC) over 1 year and subdivided into 2 categories: adherent (PDC\u200a\u2265\u200a80%), nonadherent (PDC\u200a<\u200a80%). We estimated the relative risk of hospitalization and mortality at follow-up using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.Based on a sample of 26,713 patients, adherence to OADs was quite low: 42% of the patients achieved a PDC of \u226580% during the 1-year observation period. A 7% reduction in the hospitalization risk and a 10% reduction in the risk of mortality could be observed in adherent patients compared to nonadherent patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.89-0.97]; HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.82-0.99]). Subgroup analysis showed that an intensified diabetes therapy had no significant influence on the risk of both outcomes in adherent patients.Poor medication adherence increases the risk of subsequent hospitalizations and premature mortality in patient with diabetes, regardless of disease severity and comorbidities. This emphasizes the need for an earlier identification of patients with poor medication adherence. The awareness of physicians and patients regarding the importance of adherence in diabetes treatment should be increased.",

Results with traditional radiotherapy techniques have been disappointing because of the poor conformality of the dose distributions: radiation doses were either insufficiently low resulting in poor rates of tumor control or substantial toxicity was the consequence of high-dose re-irradiation. This chapter will focus on modern techniques of radiation treatment planning and delivery, which make improved sparing of the normal tissue possible. All techniques will be discussed in the context of re-irradiation and theoretical and clinical data supporting the use of these technologies will be presented. Palliative reirradiation to moderate doses might be feasible without using advanced technology. However, under many circumstances 2D or 3D conformal approaches cannot fulfill the required normal tissue constraints. The present chapter discusses the advantages and challenges associated with more complex planning and delivery methods.",

The European Thoracic Oncology Platform (ETOP) EMPHASIS-lung trial\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION Docetaxel and erlotinib are registered second-line treatments for wild-type EGFR NSCLC. Previous studies suggested a predictive value of the Veristrat test in second-line therapy of NSCLC, classifying patients as either Veristrat \"good\" or \"poor\". EMPHASIS-lung aimed at exploring this predictive effect in patients with squamous cell NSCLC. The trial closed prematurely due to low accrual and results from other trials. Our analysis includes an exploratory combined analysis with results from the PROSE trial.\r\nMETHODS EMPHASIS-lung is a randomized phase III multicenter trial exploring the differential activity of second-line erlotinib versus docetaxel on progression-free survival (PFS) in Veristrat good versus poor patients with squamous cell NSCLC.\r\nRESULTS A total of 80 patients were randomized, with 72.5% categorized as Veristrat good. Patient characteristics were balanced between Veristrat status and treatment groups. Median PFS under docetaxel and erlotinib in the Veristrat good cohort was 4.1 and 1.6 months respectively, and 1.9 and 2.1 months in the Veristrat poor cohort. Median overall survival (OS) under docetaxel and erlotinib in the Veristrat good cohort was 7.8 and 8.4 and 4.4 and 5.2 months in the Veristrat poor cohort. An additional exploratory analysis was performed, where 47 patients from the squamous cell subgroup of PROSE were included in a combined analysis contributing with 45 PFS and 41 OS events.\r\nCONCLUSION The final analysis of EMPHASIS-lung did not show differential activity on PFS for erlotinib versus docetaxel stratified by Veristrat status. Similarly, in the combined analysis, no significant treatment by Veristrat status interaction was observed (interaction P=0.24 for PFS and 0.45 for OS, stratified by study).",

The anti-CTLA4-antibody, ipilimumab, is a standard first-line and second-line treatment option in Europe, with a median time to response of 2-3 months, but some patients show rapid clinical deterioration before that. The aim of this analysis was to identify prognostic markers for survival after failure of vemurafenib treatment to identify patients who have a sufficient life expectancy to respond to new immunotherapy treatments. We retrospectively analysed 101 consecutive unselected patients treated with vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma at a single institution. The association between clinical parameters and death within 3 months after cessation of vemurafenib (n=69) was assessed by binary logistic and Cox regression. Of the patients, 45% died within 3 months of progression on vemurafenib. Elevated baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase, absence of normalization of serum lactate dehydrogenase on vemurafenib therapy, performance status of at least 2 at progression and time from primary tumour to metastatic disease less than 5 years were identified as poor prognostic markers. In an exploratory tumour growth kinetics analysis (n=16), we found that following cessation of vemurafenib, approximately a third each showed a stable, decelerated or accelerated rate of tumour growth. Patients with these poor prognostic markers are unlikely to have sufficient life expectancy to complete ipilimumab treatment after failure with vemurafenib. Consideration needs to be given to the elective use of immunotherapy before patients become resistant to vemurafenib. This requires prospective randomized evaluation. Our tumour growth kinetics analysis requires confirmation; however, it may suggest that intermittent vemurafenib treatment should be investigated in clinical trials.",

        "document": "Title: Coping with migration-induced urban growth: addressing the blind spot of UN habitat\nAbstract: The demography of cities in the 21st century will be shaped, to a large extent, by migration. This paper argues that the rights-based approach to urban policy advocated in the preparatory work of Habitat III, the UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development to be held in October 2016 in Quito, Ecuador, may not be conducive to this goal. The approach lacks a contextual and dynamic understanding of urbanization. It implicitly assumes that a growing and expansive urban economy would primarily benefit the rich and harm the poor. The resulting containment policies to stop \u201curban sprawl\u201d and defend \u201cthe right to the city\u201d can, however, be counterproductive if adopted in cities in less developed countries (LDCs) that grow fast due to internal migration. Attempts to limit urban growth may merely lead to more informal settlements, less affordable housing, and increasing costs of doing business. In other words, it may benefit the rich and harm the poor. LDCs should, therefore, refrain from adopting defensive urban policies mostly advocated by more developed countries (MDCs) and, instead, plan for sustainable urban expansion designed to improve access to essential urban services and to create a level playing field for newcomers in business. In this context, urban policies may build upon the basic insights of the late urbanist Jane Jacobs. She recognized that the vital function of cities is to provide affordable infrastructure and an institutional environment that enable migrants and other marginal urban communities to contribute to urban prosperity and problem-solving with their skills, networks, and entrepreneurial minds. The resulting social and economic empowerment increases access to essential human rights and ensures that cities become more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable.",

Besides bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, a restrictive phenotype of CLAD (rCLAD) exists, which is associated with poor prognosis after diagnosis. However, survival determinants for rCLAD remain to be elucidated. Our aim in this study was to establish parameters predicting survival in patients with rCLAD.\r\nMETHODS: All patients diagnosed with rCLAD in 2 lung transplant centers were assessed in a retrospective manner. Various clinical parameters [demography, pulmonary function, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), histopathology, radiology and blood differentials] at rCLAD diagnosis were correlated with graft survival using unadjusted and adjusted analysis.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 53 patients with rCLAD were included with a median graft survival after diagnosis of 1.1 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated that lower-lobe-dominant or diffuse infiltrates on chest computed tomography, presence of an identifiable trigger before rCLAD onset, lymphocytic bronchiolitis, increased BAL neutrophilia, increased BAL eosinophilia and increased blood eosinophils were associated with inferior graft survival after rCLAD diagnosis. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of location of infiltrates and blood eosinophilia on graft survival.\r\nCONCLUSION: In this study we have identified parameters associated with graft survival after rCLAD diagnosis that may be useful to predict prognosis.",

A joint effort to deconstructing the multiple layers of a complex disease\nAbstract: Despite multimodal treatment, long term outcome for patients with Ewing sarcoma is still poor. The second \"European interdisciplinary Ewing sarcoma research summit\" assembled a large group of scientific experts in the field to discuss their latest unpublished findings on the way to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies. Ewing sarcoma is characterized by a quiet genome with presence of an EWSR1-ETS gene rearrangement as the only and defining genetic aberration. RNA-sequencing of recently described Ewing-like sarcomas with variant translocations identified them as biologically distinct diseases. Various presentations adressed mechanisms of EWS-ETS fusion protein activities with a focus on EWS-FLI1. Data were presented shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of genetic permissiveness to this disease uncovering interaction of EWS-FLI1 with recently discovered susceptibility loci. Epigenetic context as a consequence of the interaction between the oncoprotein, cell type, developmental stage, and tissue microenvironment emerged as dominant theme in the discussion of the molecular pathogenesis and inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of Ewing sarcoma, and the difficulty to generate animal models faithfully recapitulating the human disease. The problem of preclinical development of biologically targeted therapeutics was discussed and promising perspectives were offered from the study of novel in vitro models. Finally, it was concluded that in order to facilitate rapid pre-clinical and clinical development of novel therapies in Ewing sarcoma, the community needs a platform to maintain knowledge of unpublished results, systems and models used in drug testing and to continue the open dialogue initiated at the first two Ewing sarcoma summits.",

Most risk stratification systems predicting severe infection from admission variables have been derived from childhood or adult populations and consequently their value in adolescents/young adults (AYA) may vary. Our objective was to determine their value in this population.\r\nMETHODS: Data from the 'predicting infectious complications in children with cancer' (PICNICC) individual participant data collaboration were used to evaluate six previously described risk stratification schema in the AYA population. Complete case analyses were undertaken for five 'paediatric' rules, with imputation for specific missing variables of the 'adult' rule. The predictive performance of the rules or the outcome microbiologically defined infection (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) were compared.\r\nRESULTS: Among the 5,127 episodes of FN in 3,504 patients in the PICNICC collaboration data set, 603 episodes of FN from 478 patients in 20 studies were of patients 16-25\u00a0years old. The six rules demonstrated variable sensitivity (33-96%) and specificity (13-83%). Their overall discriminatory ability was poor (area under the receiver operator curve estimates 0.514-0.593).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Both paediatric and adult FN risk stratification schema perform poorly in AYA with cancer. An alternative rule or clinical recognition of their limitations is required.",

However, few data exist regarding patients with metastases at diagnosis. Poor outcome is described but the optimal therapeutic regimen remains unclear. Our aim was to assess the outcome, identify prognostic factors, and analyze treatment strategies.\r\nMETHODS: Patients <21 years with synovial sarcoma and primary distant metastases treated in the consecutive prospective European Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe trials 1980-2010 were analyzed.\r\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine of 296 patients had primary metastases. Twenty-seven could be included. Median age was 16.7 years. Primaries were mainly located in the limbs (78%) and 74% were \u226510 cm. Metastases involved the lungs in all patients. Two patients presented with synchronous bone metastases. Sixty-three percent of patients achieved a first remission, whereas only 26% maintained it. Relapses were metastatic with pulmonary metastases in nearly all patients. Five-year event-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were 26% and 30%, respectively. Prognosis was best for patients with oligometastatic lung metastases (5-year OS probability 85%). Prognosis was worse for patients with multiple bilateral lung metastases (5-year OS 13%) and even poorer for those with concurrent bone metastases. Treatment elements associated with superior survival were adequate local therapy of the primary tumor and, if feasible, for metastases, chemotherapy with an ifosfamide/doxorubicin-based regimen. The use of whole lung irradiation was not correlated with better outcomes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The overall prognosis of primary metastatic synovial sarcoma is poor. However, individuals with oligometastatic lung metastases had very good chance for long-term survival when treated with adequate multimodal therapy.",

We examine the transportation planning process and consequences of implementation in the run-up to the 2016 Olympic Games by triangulating qualitative and quantitative methods. We argue that because of the low cost, speed of implementation, best-practice knowledge, existing political coalitions, ease of land acquisition, and flexibility in planning, BRTs emerged as the dominant Olympic transport solution. We find that the transport planning process has undermined the public interest and placed the burdens of implementation disproportionally on the urban poor.",

It is still unclear whether viral properties such as cell tropism play a major role in this incomplete immune response. This study therefore intended to follow the tropism evolution of the HIV-1 envelope during periods of suppressive cART.  Methods Viruses from two distinct patient groups, one with good and another one with poor CD4 recovery after 5 years of suppressive cART, were genotypically analysed for viral tropism at baseline and at the end of the study period.  Results Patients with CCR5-tropic CC-motif chemokine receptor 5 viruses at baseline tended to maintain this tropism to the study end. Patients who had a CXCR4-tropic CXC-motif chemokine receptor 4 virus at baseline were overrepresented in the poor CD4 recovery group. Overall, however, the majority of patients presented with CCR5-tropic viruses at follow-up.  Conclusions Our data lend support to the hypothesis that tropism determination can be used as a parameter for disease progression even if analysed long before the establishment of a poorer immune response. Moreover, the lasting predominating CCR5-tropism during periods of full viral control suggests the involvement of cellular mechanisms that preferentially reduce CXCR4-tropic viruses during cART.",

This has been achieved by the long-term application of prevention and control measures primarily targeted to deworming dogs, health education, meat inspection, and effective surveillance in livestock and human populations. Human CE, however, remains a serious neglected zoonotic disease in many resource-poor pastoral regions. The incidence of human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) has increased in continental Europe and is a major public health problem in parts of Eurasia. Better understanding of wildlife ecology for fox and small mammal hosts has enabled targeted anthelmintic baiting of fox populations and development of spatially explicit models to predict population dynamics for key intermediate host species and human AE risk in endemic landscapes. Challenges that remain for echinococcosis control include effective intervention in resource-poor communities, better availability of surveillance tools, optimal application of livestock vaccination, and management and ecology of dog and wildlife host populations.",

Patients can present to many different specialists and diagnosis is often delayed. Severely affected patients usually present in childhood with ectopia lentis, learning difficulties and skeletal abnormalities. These patients generally require treatment with a low-methionine diet and/or betaine. In contrast, mildly affected patients are likely to present as adults with thromboembolism and to respond to treatment with pyridoxine. In this article, we present recommendations for the diagnosis and management of CBS deficiency, based on a systematic review of the literature. Unfortunately, the quality of the evidence is poor, as it often is for rare diseases. We strongly recommend measuring the plasma total homocysteine concentrations in any patient whose clinical features suggest the diagnosis. Our recommendations may help to standardise testing for pyridoxine responsiveness. Current evidence suggests that patients are unlikely to develop complications if the plasma total homocysteine concentration is maintained below 120\u00a0\u03bcmol/L. Nevertheless, we recommend keeping the concentration below 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L because levels fluctuate and the complications associated with high levels are so serious.",

We studied 521 patients with CN-AML in CR1, for whom mutational status of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD was available, including the FLT3-ITD allelic ratio. PRT consisted of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) (n=68), myeloablative conditioning (MAC) alloHSCT (n=137), autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT) (n=168) or chemotherapy (n=148). Favorable overall survival (OS) was found for patients with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (71\u00b14%). Outcome in patients with a high FLT3-ITD allelic ratio appeared to be very poor with OS and relapse-free survival (RFS) of 23\u00b18% and 12\u00b16%, respectively. Patients with wild-type NPM1 without FLT3-ITD or with a low allelic burden of FLT3-ITD were considered as intermediate-risk group because of similar OS and RFS at 5 years, in which PRT by RIC alloHSCT resulted in better OS and RFS as compared with chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.56, P=0.022 and HR 0.50, P=0.004, respectively) or autoHSCT (HR 0.60, P=0.046 and HR 0.60, P=0.043, respectively). The lowest cumulative incidence of relapse (23\u00b14%) was observed following MAC alloHSCT. These results suggest that alloHSCT may be preferred in patients with molecularly intermediate-risk CN-AML, while the choice of conditioning type may be personalized according to risk for non-relapse mortality.",

We aimed to summarize effects of bowel preparation on detection of adenomas, advanced adenomas and colorectal cancer.\r\nMETHODS A systematic literature search was performed regarding detection of colonic lesions after normal and low-quality bowel preparation. Reported bowel preparation quality was transformed to the Aronchick scale with its qualities \"excellent\", \"good\", \"fair\", \"poor\", and \"insufficient\" or \"optimal\" (good/excellent), \"suboptimal\" (fair/poor/insufficient), \"adequate\" (good/excellent/fair) and \"inadequate\" (poor/insufficient). We identified two types of studies: i) Comparative studies, directly comparing lesion detection according to bowel preparation quality, and ii) repeat colonoscopy studies, reporting results of a second colonoscopy after previous low-quality preparation.\r\nRESULTS The detection of early adenomas was reduced with inadequate vs. adequate bowel preparation (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.53, CI: 0.46-0.62, p<0.001). The advanced adenomas were affected less in comparison (0.74, CI: 0.62-0.87, p<0.001). The large number of subjects considered in the present meta-analysis resulted in smaller confidence intervals compared to earlier studies. Classifying the bowel-preparation quality as suboptimal vs. optimal led to the same qualitative conclusion (OR: 0.81, CI: 0.74-0.89, p<0.001 for early adenomas, OR: 0.94, CI: 0.87-1.01, n.s. for advanced adenomas). Bowel preparation was equally important for right-sided/ flat/ serrated vs. other lesions in most observational studies but more relevant in some repeat colonoscopy studies; data regarding carcinoma detection were insufficient.\r\nCONCLUSION Inadequate bowel preparation affects detection of early colonic lesions stronger than advanced lesions.",

Infants with a genetic comorbidity were excluded. aEEG was assessed for 12 hours pre- and 48 hours postoperatively. Background pattern was classified by the use of standard categories, and the presence of seizures and sleep-wake cycles (SWCs) was noted. Outcome at 1 and 4 years of age was assessed with standardized developmental tests.\r\nRESULTS: Preoperatively, infants either showed continuous normal voltage (n\u2009=\u200956) or discontinuous normal voltage (n\u2009=\u20094). Postoperatively, abnormal background pattern (flat trace, burst suppression, or continuous low voltage) was detected in 7 (12%), discontinuous normal voltage in 37 (61%), and continuous normal voltage in 16 (27%) infants. Nineteen infants (32%) did not return to normal SWCs within the recording period. Seizures were detected in 4 infants preoperatively and in another 4 postoperatively. After we controlled for surgical and postoperative risk factors, abnormal postoperative background pattern and lack of return to SWCs independently predicted poorer intelligence quotient at 4 years (P\u2009=\u2009.03 and P\u2009=\u2009.04 respectively) but was not related to motor outcome.\r\nCONCLUSION: aEEG is a useful bedside tool that helps to predict outcome in infants undergoing open-heart surgery for CHD. Abnormal postoperative background pattern and lack of return to SWCs are markers for subsequent impaired cognitive development.",

Chronic infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been proposed as a contributor to poorer responses in older adults. A pneumococcal vaccine has been recommended in the United Kingdom for those aged >65 years since 2003 to prevent pneumococcal disease.\r\nMETHODS We evaluated the effect of age and CMV status on pneumococcal vaccine responses in 348 individuals aged 50-70 years.\r\nRESULTS We found participant age to be associated with serotype-specific and functional antibody titers after pneumococcal vaccination, with a mean 6.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.9%-9.5%) reduction in postvaccination functional antibody titers per year. CMV status was not associated with serotype-specific immunoglobulin G concentrations or functional antibody titers after pneumococcal vaccination. However, CMV seropositivity was associated with higher levels of prevaccination functional antibody for 4 of 7 pneumococcal serotypes assessed.\r\nCONCLUSIONS These data imply that CMV infection is not directly responsible for the decline in pneumococcal vaccine responses seen with age but suggest that CMV-seropositive individuals differ in their natural exposure to pneumococci or have altered mucosal immune responses after colonization with this organism.",

The authors compare two tests for spatial resolution and two for cutaneous pressure threshold in an adult patient cohort having undergone microsurgical digital nerve repair after traumatic transection.\r\nMETHODS: Patients who underwent epineural coaptation after digital nerve transection at the authors' institution between June of 2006 and December of 2011 were asked to participate in a follow-up examination assessing spatial resolution (two-point discrimination and grating orientation test) and cutaneous pressure threshold (Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test and pressure-specifying sensory device). Interinstrument correlations were conducted and critically elucidated.\r\nRESULTS: Eighty-one patients (26 female and 55 male patients; median age, 42 years; interquartile range, 23 years) were examined with a mean follow-up period of 3.5 \u00b1 1.4 years. Although all tests could differentiate between the healthy and operated fingers, poor to moderate correlations were found between two-point discrimination and grating orientation test (\u03c1(operated) = 0.483, p < 0.0001; \u03c1(healthy) = 0.350, p < 0.0001), and between Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test and Pressure-Specified Sensory Device testing (\u03c1(operated) = 0.287, p = 0.01; \u03c1(healthy) = 0.382, p < 0.001), indicating that they measure different properties. Altogether, the grating orientation test proved superior to two-point discrimination, whereas Pressure-Specified Sensory Device testing was superior to Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Thoughtful use of test instruments is advisable when assessing sensibility of the hand. This study suggests including Pressure-Specified Sensory Device testing to assess cutaneous pressure threshold and the grating orientation test to assess spatial resolution in clinical, routine test batteries.\r\nCLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic, III.",

We report a single-center cohort of poor-grade SAH patients, combined with a systematic review of studies reporting functional outcome in the poor-grade SAH population.\r\nMETHODS Data on a cohort of poor-grade SAH patients treated between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively collected and combined with a systematic review (from inception to November 2015; PubMed, Embase). Two reviewers assessed the studies independently based on predefined inclusion criteria: consecutive poor-grade SAH, functional outcome measured at least 3\u00a0months after hemorrhage, and the report of patients who died before aneurysm treatment.\r\nRESULTS The search yielded 329 publications, and 23 met our inclusion criteria with 2713 subjects enrolled from 1977 to 2014 in 10 countries (including 179 poor-grade patients from our cohort). Mortality rate was 60\u00a0% (1683 patients), of which 806 (29\u00a0%) died before and 877 (31\u00a0%) died after aneurysm treatment, respectively. Treatment was undertaken in 1775 patients (1775/2826-63\u00a0%): 1347 by surgical clipping (1347/1775-76\u00a0%) and 428 (428/1775-24\u00a0%) by endovascular methods. Outcome was favorable in 794 patients (28\u00a0%) and unfavorable in 1867 (66\u00a0%). When the studies were grouped into decades, favorable outcome increased from 13\u00a0% in the late 1970s to early 1980s to 35\u00a0% in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and remained unchanged thereafter.\r\nCONCLUSION Although mortality remains high in poor-grade SAH patients, a favorable functional outcome can be achieved in approximately one-third of patients. The development of new diagnostic methods and implementation of therapeutic approaches were probably responsible for the decrease in mortality and improvement in the functional outcome from 1970 to the 1990s. The plateau in functional outcome seen thereafter might be explained by the treatment of sicker and older patients and by the lack of new therapeutic interventions specific for SAH.",

The aim of the current study was to examine the association of LOC to functional outcomes in patients with good-grade SAH.\r\nMETHODS We searched the Subarachnoid Hemorrhage International Trialists Repository for patients that presented with LOC at ictus of SAH. A propensity score analysis was performed on good-grade patients (defined as World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades 1-3) to balance selected covariates between those with and without LOC. Primary outcome was Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at 3 months (with poor outcome defined as GOS of 1-3). Secondary outcomes were delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), rebleed, length of hospital stay, and time to death.\r\nRESULTS A propensity score-matching algorithm identified 337 patients (168 with LOC at ictus, and 168 without). The proportion of patients with poor functional outcome at 3-months was significantly higher in those who had LOC at ictus compared to the matched cohort without LOC (30% vs. 19%; P = 0.02). There was a non-significant trend toward higher mortality in patients with LOC (19% vs. 13%; P = 0.14). There were no differences in the secondary outcomes.\r\nCONCLUSIONS LOC of at ictus of SAH is associated with higher rate of unfavorable functional outcomes but not mortality, DCI or rebleed in good-grade SAH patients. Future studies should further investigate the putative mechanisms by which LOC mediates early brain injury in SAH.",

Broad consensus is lacking regarding the concept that ultra-early treatment improves outcome. The aim of this study is to determine the associative factors for ICH, ascertain the prognostic value of ICH, and investigate how the timing of treatment relates to the outcome of SAH with concurrent ICH. METHODS The study data were pooled from the SAH International Trialists repository. Logistic regression was applied to study the associations of clinical and aneurysm characteristics with ICH. Proportional odds models and dominance analysis were applied to study the effect of ICH on 3-month outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale) and investigate the effect of time from ictus to treatment on outcome. RESULTS Of the 5362 SAH patients analyzed, 1120 (21%) had concurrent ICH. In order of importance, neurological status, aneurysm location, aneurysm size, and patient ethnicity were significantly associated with ICH. Patients with ICH experienced poorer outcome than those without ICH (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.37-1.82). Treatment within 6 hours of SAH was associated with poorer outcome than treatment thereafter (adjusted OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.04-2.69). Subgroup analysis with adjustment for ICH volume, location, and midline shift resulted in no association between time from ictus to treatment and outcome (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.94-1.07). CONCLUSIONS The most important associative factor for ICH is neurological status on admission. The finding regarding the value of ultra-early treatment suggests the need to more robustly reevaluate the concept that hematoma evacuation of an ICH and repair of a ruptured aneurysm within 6 hours of ictus is the most optimal treatment path.",

        "document": "Title: Disagreement between skin prick tests and specific IgE in early childhood\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of allergic sensitization is essential in clinical practice and allergy research, and the choice of assessment method may have an important impact. The PASTURE study (Protection against Allergy: Study of Rural Environment) examines the influence of exposure to a dairy farm environment on the occurrence of allergy in a cohort of rural European children from birth to 10 years. The aim of our study was to analyze agreement between skin prick tests (SPTs), to aeroallergens and food allergens, and specific IgE and to evaluate the association of SPT with atopic dermatitis in the 204 French children of the PASTURE study.\r\nMETHODS: SPT, atopic dermatitis assessment, and specific IgE measurements were performed at 1, 4.5, and 6 years.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 137 children attended all three visits. The agreement between SPTs and specific IgE was poor except for perennial aeroallergens at 6 years and for an IgE cutoff greater than 0.7 IU/ml (\u03ba = 0.69, 0.5202 - 0.8621). The prevalence of positive SPTs increased with age. Positive SPTs were transient at 1 year, whereas they were persistent between 4.5 and 6 years. Positive SPTs at 1 year were predictive of the occurrence of atopic dermatitis during follow-up.\r\nCONCLUSION: SPTs did not have good agreement with serum-specific IgE in early childhood. Both tests (SPT and specific IgE) should be used. Skin allergenic reactivity increased with age and was transient at 1 year but associated with the occurrence of atopic dermatitis.",

        "document": "Title: Gleaning: old name, new practice\nAbstract: The practice of gleaning is linked to the centuries-old custom embedded in the customary laws of many people, according to which the master of the land holds the right to allow the poor to follow harvesters in the field and to gather and glean the fallen spears of grain. In this article, the new meaning of the practice of gleaning is analyzed by using an example of one Serbian village in Vojvodina province, Gaj, which is still predominately agricultural. In a strict sense, the name of the old practice is kept, but the essence of the practice itself and its symbolism have changed radically. In previous times, the term \u201cgleaning\u201d referred to the reciprocal social, economic and political relationship between the poor and the landowner. Today, in the context of the village of Gaj, it is mostly used as a euphemism for field theft. The article analyzes this gradual shift in diachronic and social-anthropological perspectives, aiming to depict and explain crucial changes in informal and formal institutions that have contributed to this current understanding of gleaning.",

Though it was once considered to be among the \u2018greenest\u2019 and most \u2018orderly\u2019 cities of the Soviet Union, today many of its long-term residents complain about the new settlements (novostroiki) that have emerged during the last two decades. To Bishkek's urbanites, the recent arrival of migrants is not associated with an escape from rural poverty and a rightful struggle for civic rights, but indicates a massive cultural and aesthetic degradation of familiar urban life. In this article, beyond contesting narratives of cosmopolitan nostalgia vs. legitimate belonging, I investigate how urban practitioners in fact produce and deal with different spaces in the city. My ethnographic accounts not only identify social avoidance as an essential pulse of Bishkek's current rhythm, but also illustrate that after a period of post-rural socialization previously stigmatized migrants may manage to smoothly blend into urban spatial flows and lifestyles.",

The purpose of this study is to review the results of a moderate varisation [planned neck shaft angle (NSA) of 130\u00b0] in combination with pelvic osteotomy for a consecutive series of patients.\r\nMETHODS: Patients with CP who had been treated at our institution for hip dysplasia, subluxation or dislocation with VDRO in combination with pelvic osteotomy between 2005 and 2010 were reviewed.\r\nRESULTS: Forty patients with a mean follow-up of 5.4\u00a0years were included. The mean age at the time of operation was 8.9\u00a0years. The majority were non-ambulant children [GMFCS I-III: n\u00a0=\u00a011 (27.5\u00a0%); GMFCS IV-V: n\u00a0=\u00a029 (72.5\u00a0%)]. In total, 57 hips were treated with both femoral and pelvic osteotomy. The mean pre-operative NSA angle of 152.3\u00b0 was reduced to 132.6\u00b0 post-operatively. Additional adductor tenotomy was performed in nine hips (16\u00a0%) at initial operation. Reimers' migration percentage (MP) was improved from 63.6\u00a0% pre-operatively to 2.7\u00a0% post-operatively and showed a mean of 9.7\u00a0% at the final review. The results were good in 96.5\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a055) with centred, stable hips (MP <33\u00a0%), fair in one with a subluxated hip (MP 42\u00a0%) and poor in one requiring revision pelvic osteotomy for ventral instability.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: This approach maintains good hip abduction and reduces soft-tissue surgery. Moderate varisation in VDRO in combination with pelvic osteotomy leads to good mid-term results with stable, pain-free hips, even in patients with severe spastic quadriplegia.",

The combination of depression and chronic medical disease in turn is linked with poorer health and premature death. Despite numerous studies on mortality in people with depression and chronic medical disease, the effects of age and gender were not consistently considered. To appropriately estimate mortality in the clinical setting, we aimed to analyse age- and gender-specific mortality profiles in outpatients with depression and chronic medical disease by considering depression severity.\r\nMETHODS: We examined data from N=327,018 outpatients with depression aged 18 years and older (mean=60 years), which we obtained from German electronic health-insurance claims data covering the years 2007-2010. We considered major chronic medical disease groups: cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, diseases of the respiratory system and cancer. To analyse both adjusted mortality risk and rates over one year in a comprehensive manner, we calculated General Estimation Equation (GEE) Poisson models for binary data.\r\nRESULTS: The mortality risk increased with age and was higher for males. Especially patients below 60 years of age with cancer or diabetes had an increased mortality risk, but not patients with cardiovascular disease. Mortality was comparably increased in patients with severe depression, diabetes or respiratory disease.\r\nLIMITATIONS: We did not have data from a control group without depression.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Notably, not cardiovascular diseases but cancer and, to a lesser extent, diabetes, both in younger patients, respiratory diseases and severity of depression require particular attention in outpatient care to reduce mortality.",

Australia suffers one of the world's highest rates of MPM and the incidence is yet to peak. The prognosis for patients with MPM is poor and median survival following diagnosis is 4-18\u00a0months. Currently, no or few effective therapies exist for MPM. Trials of targeted agents such as antiangiogenic agents (VEGF, EGFR) or ribonuclease inhibitors (ranpirnase) largely failed to show efficacy in MPM Tsao et al. (2009) [1]. A recent study, however, showed that cisplatin/pemetrexed\u00a0+\u00a0bevacizumab (a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibit VEGF) treatment has a survival benefit of 2.7\u00a0months Zalcman et al. (2016) [2]. It remains to be seen if this targeted therapy will be accepted as a new standard for MPM. Thus the unmet needs of MPM patients remain very pronounced and almost every patient will be confronted with drug resistance and recurrence of disease. We have identified unique gene signatures associated with prolonged survival in mesothelioma patients undergoing radical surgery (EPP, extrapleural pneumonectomy), as well as patients who underwent palliative surgery (pleurectomy/decortication). In addition to data published in Molecular Oncology, 2015;9:715-26 (GSE59180) Kirschner et al. (2015) , we describe here additional data using a system-based approach that support our previous observations. This data provides a resource to further explore microRNA dynamics in MPM.",

Modular megaprostheses are established reconstruction tools for the elbow, but only small case series have been reported in the literature.\r\nMETHODS Thirty-six patients who underwent reconstruction of the elbow joint with a modular megaprosthesis were reviewed retrospectively. In 31 patients (86.1%), elbow replacement was performed after resection of a bone tumour, whereas five non-oncological patients (13.9%) underwent surgery because of a previous failed elbow reconstruction. Functional outcome, rate of complications and oncological results were considered as primary endpoints.\r\nRESULTS The mean follow-up was 25 months. The average achieved Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was 77.08 (range 40-95) and the average Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score was 22.9 (range 8-30). Six complications (16.7%) were observed: two radial palsies, one temporary radial nerve dysfunction, one ulnar palsy, one disassembling of the articular prosthesis component and one deep infection necessitating the only implant removal. The overall 5-year survival rate of the patients was poor (25.1%) because of rapid systemic progression of the oncological disease in patients with metastatic lesion. However, the 5-year survival rate of the implant was very satisfactory (93%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS Modular megaprosthesis is a reliable and effective reconstruction tool in large bone defects around the elbow joint. The complication rates are lower than seen in osteoarticular allografts and allograft-prosthesis composites while the functional outcome is equal. In palliative situations with metastatic disease involving the elbow, modular megaprosthesis enables rapid recovery and pain relief and preserves elbow function.",

A total of 188 CHR-positive subjects (60.2% men) aged between 13 and 35years (mean=20.5) at study outset were assessed five times (t0-t4) over a total observation period of 36months. Conversion to manifest psychosis was defined according to ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia (F20) or brief psychotic disorder (F23). Measures of positive and negative symptoms were assessed with the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS), depression with the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS), and global functioning with the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). Converters scored higher over time on all SIPS scales apart from grandiosity (Cohen's d: 0.5-0.7; all p<0.001), higher on the CDS (d=0.43, p=0.001) and lower on the GAF (d=0.69, p<0.001) than did non-converters. Positive and negative symptoms as well as depression were most severe at study outset (t0) and then declined sharply following a linear function over the three-year observation period (t1-t4) across groups (all linear contrasts p<0.001). In conclusion, converters showed significantly more psychopathological symptoms and poorer functioning before crossing the diagnostic threshold for manifest psychosis. CHR-subjects who convert to manifest psychosis during follow-up appear to be recovering from illness rather than becoming ill. Major issues involve the poor discrimination of CHR state and psychosis as well as the dichotomous definition of both at-risk and disease states. Further examination in other CHR-samples is warranted.",

Drug efficacy was assessed in an open-label and randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study design with regular baseline assessments over a period of 2 years using the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12) as outcome measures.\r\nResults: The data showed good tolerability and persisting efficacy of PR fampridine during long-term treatment in PwMS. Significant improvements in walking speed, endurance, and self-perceived ambulatory function were observed during open-label (T25FW: +11.5%; 6MWT: 10.7%; MSWS-12: 6.1 points) and double-blind controlled treatment with PR fampridine (T25FW: +13.1%; 6MWT: 11.9%; MSWS-12: 7.4 points). Several patients showed changes in drug responsiveness over time, resulting in an increased proportion of patients exceeding 10% or 20% improvements in walking measures after long-term treatment.\r\nConclusions: Efficacy and tolerability data confirmed PR fampridine as a valuable long-term treatment for improving ambulatory function in gait-impaired PwMS. Similar results in open-label and double-blind phases reveal that the walking tests used are objective and reliable. The considerable proportion of patients in whom responsiveness to PR fampridine changed over time emphasizes the importance of regular reassessment of drug efficacy in clinical practice to optimize treatment. Such reassessments seem to be particularly important in patients with poor initial drug responses, as this group demonstrated enhanced responsiveness after long-term treatment.",

Older adults performed poorly compared to younger adults partly due to searching too few options. An analysis of the decision process with a formal model suggested that older adults set lower thresholds for accepting an option than younger participants. Further analyses suggested that positive affect, but not fluid abilities, was related to search in the sequential decision task. A second study that manipulated affect in younger adults supported the causal role of affect: Increased positive affect lowered the initial threshold for accepting an attractive option. In sum, our results suggest that positive affect is a key factor determining search in sequential decision making. Consequently, increased positive affect in older age may contribute to poorer sequential decisions by leading to insufficient search.",

We assessed the prevalence of job stress and its correlates in a large cohort of patients with IBD.\r\nMETHODS We included all adult, professionally active patients enrolled between 2006 and 2015 in the Swiss IBD Cohort. Job stress was measured through the self-report effort-reward imbalance ratio and overcommitment (OC) to work questionnaires. We used multiple linear regressions to assess association with sociodemographic, lifestyle, psychosocial, and disease-related factors.\r\nRESULTS Altogether 1656 patients completed the questionnaires (905 Crohn's disease and 751 ulcerative colitis/IBD unclassified). Only 91 (5.7%) of patients had an effort-reward imbalance ratio >1. Effort-reward imbalance and OC scores were higher in full-time versus part-time employees (coef = 0.050, P = 0.002; coef = 0.906, P < 0.001) and among those absent from the workplace in the previous 3 months (coef = 0.049, P = 0.010; coef = 1.062, P < 0.001). Higher OC scores were associated with sex (women vs. men: coef = 0.568, P = 0.014), being in a relationship (coef = 0.805, P = 0.001), higher level of occupation (director vs. trainee: coef = 1.447, P < 0.001), and extraintestinal manifestations (coef = 0.623, P = 0.005). Patients hospitalized in the previous 12 months had lower OC scores (coef = 0.560, P = 0.038).\r\nCONCLUSIONS The average level of job stress seems to be remarkably low in patients with IBD from Switzerland. The clinician should turn attention especially to women, full-time employees with a high level of education, and patients with extraintestinal manifestations to identify those with the most vulnerability to suffer from job stress.",

        "document": "Title: Vagal Regulation of Cardiac Function in Early Childhood and Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescence\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Poor behavioral self-regulation in the first two decades of life has been identified as an important precursor of disease risk in adulthood. However, physiological regulation has not been well-studied as a disease risk factor before adulthood. We tested whether physiological regulation at age two, in the form of vagal regulation of cardiac function (indexed by RSA change), would predict three indicators of cardiovascular risk at age 16 (diastolic and systolic blood pressure and body mass index).\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Data came from 229 children who participated in a community-based longitudinal study. At age two, children were assessed for RSA baseline and RSA change [ln(ms)2] in response to a series of challenge tasks. These same children were assessed again at age 16 for diastolic and systolic blood pressure (mmHg), height (m) and weight (kg).\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that less RSA withdrawal at age two predicted higher diastolic blood pressure at age 16, adjusting for demographic characteristics (B = -3.07**, S.E. = 1.12, p = .006). Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these predictions extended to clinically significant levels of diastolic prehypertension (odds ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval, .22-.89). RSA withdrawal did not significantly predict adolescent body mass index or systolic blood pressure.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Vagal regulation of cardiac function in early childhood predicts select indicators of cardiovascular risk 14 years later. Early signs of attenuated vagal regulation could indicate an increased risk for elevated blood pressure before adulthood. Future research should test biological, behavioral, and psychological mechanisms underlying these long-term predictions.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the early course of DSM-5 CUD\u00a0and its overlap with DSM-IV and consumption constructs in a community-representative sample of American Indians.\r\n\r\nMETHOD: Data came from the prospective, longitudinal, population-based Great Smoky Mountains Study in North Carolina (N\u00a0= 1,420, including 349 American Indians). Cannabis use and disorder were assessed during yearly interviews from 9 to 16 years of age and at 19, 21, 26, and 30 years of age (up to 11 assessments per participant from 1993 through 2015).\r\n\r\nRESULTS: By 30 years of age, approximately 70% of participants had used cannabis, 34% had used cannabis daily, and 18% had met criteria for DSM-5 CUD. Approximately 1 in 4 cannabis users met criteria for CUD at some point. Those who met criteria initiated use more than 2 years previously (at 13.3 years old) compared with other users. Despite higher risks from increased poverty, American Indians' patterns of use were similar to those of the rest of\u00a0the sample. Concordance between DSM-5 CUD and DSM-IV abuse or dependence was substantial but was even higher between DSM-5 CUD and daily use.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: It was common to have used cannabis daily or to have met criteria for DSM-5 CUD by adulthood. DSM-5 CUD was an improvement over DSM-IV diagnostic constructs by raising the threshold for diagnosis.",

We find that reducing barriers to saving through access to free savings accounts decreases participants' short-term debt by about 20%. In addition, participants who experience an economic shock have less need to reduce consumption, and subjective well-being improves significantly. Precautionary savings and credit therefore act as substitutes in providing self-insurance, and participants prefer borrowing less when a free formal savings account is available. Take-up patterns suggest that requests by others for participants to share their resources may be a key obstacle to saving.",

In addition to staging, morphological subtyping allows stratification of patients into additional prognostic groups. In this study, we used an image-based computational method on pan-cytokeratin immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings to quantify tumor fragmentation (TF), a measure of tumor invasiveness of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In two independent clinical cohorts from tissue microarrays (TMA: n=208 patients) and whole sections (WS: n=99 patients), TF was associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of blood vessel infiltration. A third cohort from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA: n=335 patients) confirmed the poor prognostic value of TF using a similar human-based score on haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Integration of RNA-seq data from TCGA and LC-MS/MS proteomics from WS revealed an upregulation of extracellular matrix remodeling and focal adhesion processes in tumors with high TF, supporting their increased invasive potential. This proposed histologic parameter is an independent and unfavorable prognostic marker that could be established as a new grading parameter for LSCC.",

If such additions do not affect the coefficient of interest (much) a study is presumed to be reliable. We caution that such invariance may result from the fact that the observed variables used in such robustness checks are often poor measures of the potential underlying confounders. In this case, a more powerful test of the identifying assumption is to put the variable on the left hand side of the candidate regression. We provide derivations for the estimators and test statistics involved, as well as power calculations, which can help applied researchers interpret their findings. We illustrate these results in the context of various strategies which have been suggested to identify the returns to schooling.",

Households in the rich North (poor South) are willing to pay high (low) prices for consumer goods; hence, unconstrained monopoly pricing generates arbitrage opportunities for internationally traded products. Export zeros arise because some northern firms abstain from exporting to the South, to avoid international arbitrage. Rich countries benefit from a trade liberalization, while poor countries lose. These results hold also under more general preferences with both extensive and intensive consumption margins. We show that a standard calibrated trade model (that ignores arbitrage) generates predictions on relative prices that violate no-arbitrage constraints in many bilateral trade relations. This suggests that international arbitrage is potentially important.",

We investigate whether the quality of agricultural inputs can help explain low take-up. Testing modern products purchased in local markets, we find that 30% of nutrient is missing in fertilizer, and hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain less than 50% authentic seeds. We document that such low quality results in low average returns. If authentic technologies replaced these low-quality products, however, average returns are high. To rationalize the findings, we calibrate a learning model using data from our agricultural trials.

In order to better understand SSRI action, we explored the hypothesis that SSRIs do not affect mood per se but amplify the influence of the living conditions on mood. To this aim, we exploited the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) data set, selected a subpopulation of 591 patients with an overlapping clinical history and analyzed treatment outcome according to dosage \u221220 or 40\u2009mg per day of citalopram. We found that sociodemographic characteristics affected treatment response in the same direction in the two dose groups, but these effects reached statistical significance only in the 40\u2009mg per day dose group. In the latter, higher improvement rate was associated with having a working employment status (P=0.0219), longer education (P=0.0053), high income (P=0.01) or a private insurance (P=0.0031), and the higher remission rate was associated with having a working employment status (P=0.0326) or longer education (P=0.0484). Moreover, the magnitude of the effect of the sociodemographic characteristics on mood, measured as the percent of patients showing a positive outcome when exposed to favorable living conditions, was much greater\u2014up to 37-fold\u2014in the 40 compared to the 20\u2009mg per day dose group. Overall, our results indicate that citalopram amplifies the influence of the living conditions on mood in a dose-dependent manner. These findings provide a potential explanation for the variable efficacy of SSRIs and might lead to the development of personalized strategies aimed at enhancing their efficacy.",

As a result, it has become one of the most talked-about innovations in global development in recent decades. However, its expansion has not been without controversy. While many hailed it as a way to end world poverty and promote female empowerment, others condemned it as a disaster for the poor. Female empowerment has often been seen as one of the key promises of the industry. In part, this is based on the fact that more than 80% of its poorest clients, i.e., those who live on less than $1.25/day, are women. This paper discusses what we have learned so far about the potential and limits of microfinance and how insights from research and practice can help inform the industry's current products, policies and future developments.",

Its impact on society is often not taken into account and deemed controversial. Our study examined attitudes of the Swiss population regarding extreme prematurity and people\u2019s perspectives regarding the question of solidarity with disabled people.\r\nMETHODS: We conducted a nationwide representative anonymous telephone survey with 1210 Swiss residents aged 18 years or older. We asked how people estimate their own personal solidarity, the solidarity of their social environment and the solidarity across the country with disabled persons. Spearman\u2019s correlation calculations were used to assess if a correlation exists between solidarity and setting financial limits to intensive care and between solidarity and withholding neonatal intensive care.\r\nRESULTS: According to 36.0% of the respondents intensive medical care should not be withheld from extremely preterm infants, even if their chances for an acceptable quality of life were poor. For 28.8%, intensive care should be withheld from these infants, and 26.9% held an intermediate position depending on the situation. A total of 31.5% were against setting a financial limit to treatment of extremely preterm newborns with an uncertain future quality of life, 34.2% were in favour and 26.9% were deliberating. A majority (88.8%) considered their solidarity toward disabled people as substantial; the solidarity of their personal environment and of the society at large was estimated as high by 79.1% and 48.6%, respectively.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The Swiss population expressed a high level of solidarity which may alleviate some pressure on parents and health care providers in the decision-making process in neonatal intensive care units. In addition, there was no relationship between solidarity and people\u2019s willingness to pay for the care or withholding treatment of extremely preterm babies.",

Studies could be conducted in insurance settings, where decisions on ability to work include normative judgments based on legal considerations, or in research settings, where decisions on ability to work disregard normative considerations. : Teams of paired reviewers identified eligible studies, appraised their methodological quality and generalisability, and abstracted results with pretested forms. As heterogeneity of research designs and findings impeded a quantitative analysis, a descriptive synthesis stratified by setting (insurance or research) was performed.\r\nRESULTS: From 4562 references, 101 full text articles were reviewed. Of these, 16 studies conducted in an insurance setting and seven in a research setting, performed in 12 countries, met the inclusion criteria. Studies in the insurance setting were conducted with medical experts assessing claimants who were actual disability claimants or played by actors, hypothetical cases, or short written scenarios. Conditions were mental (n=6, 38%), musculoskeletal (n=4, 25%), or mixed (n=6, 38%). Applicability of findings from studies conducted in an insurance setting to real life evaluations ranged from generalisable (n=7, 44%) and probably generalisable (n=3, 19%) to probably not generalisable (n=6, 37%). Median inter-rater reliability among experts was 0.45 (range intraclass correlation coefficient 0.86 to \u03ba-0.10). Inter-rater reliability was poor in six studies (37%) and excellent in only two (13%). This contrasts with studies conducted in the research setting, where the median inter-rater reliability was 0.76 (range 0.91-0.53), and 71% (5/7) studies achieved excellent inter-rater reliability. Reliability between assessing professionals was higher when the evaluation was guided by a standardised instrument (23 studies, P=0.006). No such association was detected for subjective or chronic health conditions or the studies' generalisability to real world evaluation of disability (P=0.46, 0.45, and 0.65, respectively).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite their common use and far reaching consequences for workers claiming disabling injury or illness, research on the reliability of medical evaluations of disability for work is limited and indicates high variation in judgments among assessing professionals. Standardising the evaluation process could improve reliability. Development and testing of instruments and structured approaches to improve reliability in evaluation of disability are urgently needed.",

The test battery included the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS), verbal IQ and many other screening tools. Conversion to psychosis was defined according to ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia (F20) or brief psychotic disorder (F23).\r\nRESULTS: Altogether n=24 persons developed manifest psychosis within three years and according to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the projected conversion rate was 17.5%. The predictive accuracy of UHR was statistically significant but poor (area under the curve [AUC]=0.65, P<.05), whereas BS did not predict psychosis beyond mere chance (AUC=0.52, P=.730). Sensitivity and specificity were 0.83 and 0.47 for UHR, and 0.96 and 0.09 for BS. UHR plus BS achieved an AUC=0.66, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 0.56. In comparison, baseline antipsychotic medication yielded a predictive accuracy of AUC=0.62 (sensitivity=0.42; specificity=0.82). A multivariable prediction model comprising continuous measures of positive symptoms and verbal IQ achieved a substantially improved prognostic accuracy (AUC=0.85; sensitivity=0.86; specificity=0.85; positive predictive value=0.54; negative predictive value=0.97).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: We showed that BS have no predictive accuracy beyond chance, while UHR criteria poorly predict conversion to psychosis. Combining BS with UHR criteria did not improve the predictive accuracy of UHR alone. In contrast, dimensional measures of both positive symptoms and verbal IQ showed excellent prognostic validity. A critical re-thinking of binary at-risk criteria is necessary in order to improve the prognosis of psychotic disorders.",

In this sense, the Mirrlees model is an application of Diamond-Mirrlees. We also provide a simple derivation of the Mirrleesian optimal income tax formula from the Diamond-Mirrlees commodity tax formula. In the Mirrlees model, the relevant compensated cross-price elasticities are zero, providing a situation where an inverse elasticity rule holds. We provide four extensions that illustrate the power and ease of our approach, based on Diamond-Mirrlees, to study nonlinear taxation. First, we consider annual taxation in a lifecycle context. Second, we include human capital investments. Third, we incorporate more general forms of heterogeneity into the basic Mirrlees model. Fourth, we consider an extensive margin labor force participation decision, alongside the intensive margin choice. In all these cases, the relevant optimality condition is easily obtained as a direct application of the general Diamond-Mirrlees linear tax formula.",

        "document": "Title: Optimal taxation with rent-seeking\nAbstract: We develop a framework for optimal taxation when agents can earn their income both in traditional activities, where private and social products coincide, and in rent-seeking activities, where private returns exceed social returns either because they involve the capture of pre-existing rents or because they reduce the returns to traditional work. We characterize Pareto optimal income taxes that do not condition on how much of an individual's income is earned in each of the two activities. These optimal taxes feature an externality-corrective term, the magnitude of which depends both on the Pigouvian correction that would obtain if rent-seeking incomes could be perfectly targeted and on the relative impact of rent-seeking externalities on the private returns to traditional and to rent-seeking activities. If rent-seeking externalities primarily affect other rent-seekers, for example, the optimal correction lies strictly below the Pigouvian correction. A calibrated model indicates that the gap between the Pigouvian and optimal correction can be quantitatively important. Our results thus point to a hefty informational requirement for correcting rent-seeking externalities through the income tax code.",

We demonstrate that industry affiliation is correlated with fixed individual characteristics, specifically parents' education and own height, conditional on the covariates typically controlled for in these studies.

A Comparison of 4 Emergency Tapes With Different Length-Based Weight Categorization\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Pediatric emergency tapes have been developed to support paramedics and emergency physicians when dosing drugs and selecting medical equipment in pediatric emergency situations. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of 4 pediatric emergency tapes to correctly estimate patient's weight based on a large population of patients.\r\nMETHODS: Patients undergoing general anesthesia between January 2012 and March 2015 with documented age, sex, body weight, and length were identified from the electronic anesthesia patient data management system of the Department of Anaesthesia, University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. Weight estimation by means of the Broselow-Tape, the P\u00e4diatrisches Notfalllineal, the Paulino System, and the Kinder-Sicher were compared with true patient's weight. Percentages of estimated body weight within a \u00b110% and \u00b120% interval were calculated. Data are median (interquartile range) or count (percent); statistical calculations were done with McNemar and Bonferroni correction.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 3307 patients were identified with complete data sets, 1930 (58.4%) were male, median age was 4.1 years (1.1-8.2 years), median length 101.0 cm (74.0-126.0 cm) and median patient weight 15.8 kg (9.2-25.0 kg). The proportion weight estimation within the \u00b110% and the \u00b120% interval was the highest in the Broselow-Tape with 54.0% and 81.5% (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003), followed by the P\u00e4diatrisches Notfalllineal (50.5% and 79.8%), Paulino System (49.9% and 78.0%) and Kinder-Sicher (48.2% and 77.5%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The overall accuracy of all 4 emergency tapes tested is poor and including a larger number of weight categories does not necessarily increase accuracy. Other strategies have to be developed to improve weight estimation in pediatric emergency situations.",

        "document": "Title: Within-mother analysis of seasonal patterns in health at birth\nAbstract: A large literature describes relationships between month of birth, birth weight, and gestation. These relationships are hypothesized to reflect the causal impact of seasonal environmental factors. However, recent work casts doubt on this interpretation by showing that mothers with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to give birth in months that are associated with poorer birth outcomes. Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth. This paper analyzes the seasonality of health at birth using a large sample of 647,050 groups of US siblings representing 1,435,213 children. By following the same mother over time, we eliminate differences in fixed maternal characteristics as an explanation for seasonal differences in health at birth. We find a sharp trough in gestation length among babies conceived in May, which corresponds to an increase in prematurity of more than 10%. Birth weight conditional on gestation length, however, is found to be strongly hump-shaped over the year, with 8\u20139 additional g for summer conceptions. We examine several potential mechanisms for explaining seasonality in birth outcomes that have generally been dismissed in the literature on seasonality in rich countries, notably disease prevalence and nutrition. The May trough in gestation length coincides with a higher influenza prevalence in January and February, when these babies are nearing full term, whereas the hump shape in birth weight is associated with a similar pattern in pregnancy weight gain.",

        "document": "Title: When work disappears: manufacturing decline and the falling marriage-market value of men\nAbstract: The structure of marriage and child-rearing in U.S. households has undergone two marked shifts in the last three decades: a steep decline in the prevalence of marriage among young adults, and a sharp rise in the fraction of children born to unmarried mothers or living in single-headed households. A potential contributor to both phenomena is the declining labor-market opportunities faced by males, which make them less valuable as marital partners. We exploit large scale, plausibly exogenous labor-demand shocks stemming from rising international manufacturing competition to test how shifts in the supply of young \u2018marriageable\u2019 males affect marriage, fertility and children's living circumstances. Trade shocks to manufacturing industries have differentially negative impacts on the labor market prospects of men and degrade their marriage-market value along multiple dimensions: diminishing their relative earnings\u2014particularly at the lower segment of the distribution\u2014reducing their physical availability in trade-impacted labor markets, and increasing their participation in risky and damaging behaviors. As predicted by a simple model of marital decision-making under uncertainty, we document that adverse shocks to the supply of `marriageable' men reduce the prevalence of marriage and lower fertility but raise the fraction of children born to young and unwed mothers and living in in poor single-parent households. The falling marriage-market value of young men appears to be a quantitatively important contributor to the rising rate of out-of-wedlock childbearing and single-headed childrearing in the United States.",

Thus far, studies on interoception have mainly focused on the ability to monitor the timing of ongoing heartbeats and on how these influence emotional and self-related processes. However, cardiac afferent signalling is not confined to heartbeat timing and several other cardiac parameters characterize cardiodynamic functioning. Building on the fact that each heart has its own self-specific cardio-dynamics, which cannot be expressed uniquely by heart rate, we devised a novel task to test whether people could recognize the sound of their own heart even when perceived offline and thus not in synchrony with ongoing heartbeats. In a forced-choice paradigm, participants discriminated between sounds of their own heartbeat (previously recorded with a Doppler device) versus another person\u2019s heart. Participants identified the sound of their own heart above chance, whereas their metacognition of performance \u2013 as calculated by contrasting performance against ratings of confidence - was considerably poorer. These results suggest an implicit access to fine-grained neural representations of elementary cardio-dynamic parameters beyond heartbeat timing.",

The present study examines these approach-avoidance relationship goals in relation to self-reported relationship problems, stress communication, and dyadic coping. Hypotheses were tested on a dyadic level (Actor-Partner Interdependence Model) using data from 368 couples. As expected, people endorsing approach goals reported fewer relationship problems, more effective stress communication, and better dyadic coping. People endorsing avoidance goals reported more relationship problems and poorer dyadic coping. Further, approach-oriented people tended to perceive their partner as being more communicative and more supportive, whereas avoidance-oriented people tended to perceive their partner as more communicative but less supportive. Reports by partners agreed with the self-reports of approach- and avoidance-oriented spouses concerning stress communication and dyadic coping. These findings highlight motivational factors in general, and orientation towards approach-avoidance goals in particular, as key features in understanding relationship maintenance.",

The purpose of this study was to compare secular changes in stature between 20th century South Africans of European descent and two European populations. The comparative samples include Dutch males with which there is an assumed genetic relationship, and Swiss males for which the genetic association is less clear. The sample comprised anthropometric stature data of white South Africans (17 - 62 years), Swiss and Dutch males (18 - 21 years) obtained from military conscripts with birth cohorts of 5 years from 1946 to 1995. The stature of white South African males did not increase at a significant rate compared to those observed in Swiss and Dutch males. South African and Dutch males were of similar height following World War II, but a considerable trend was observed only in the Dutch group. The Swiss group was initially shorter than the South Africans, but due to a positive secular trend their average stature is on a par with that of South Africans in the most recent cohort. The lack of a significant positive secular trend in the South African group could suggest that factors such as gene flow and poor economic and social development in South Africa resulted in shorter statures in white South African groups than expected.",

Prognosis is poor, and overall survival at 1\u00a0year is only approximately 10%. Management depends mainly on general and neurological condition, primary tumor, and patterns of metastasis, notably absence or presence of concurrent systemic or solid brain metastases. Here we set out to characterize current practice patterns of diagnosis and treatment of patients with leptomeningeal metastasis in Europe. We prepared a web-based survey including 25 simple or multiple choices questions on best practice supplemented by eight case vignettes with various diagnosis and management options. The survey was sent to the membership of the European Association of Neuro-Oncology and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumor Group. Between April 7, 2016 and August 8, 2016, 224 colleagues from 26 countries initiated the survey, 115 colleagues completed the whole survey. There were major differences both in the general diagnostic and therapeutic approach, e.g., regarding the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow studies, intra-CSF chemotherapy, various types of radiotherapy, and even more so when selecting decisions on diagnostic and therapeutic measures for single case vignettes. Diagnosis and treatment decisions for patients with leptomeningeal metastasis from solid tumors vary widely across Europe. Standardization of diagnosis and evaluation tools as well as controlled studies to improve the level of evidence for all therapeutic approaches to LM are required.",

So far, mainly chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations or larger deletions affecting FOXP2 have been reported. Intragenic deletions or convincingly pathogenic point mutations in FOXP2 have up to date only been reported in three families. We thus aimed at a further characterisation of the mutational and clinical spectrum.\r\nMETHODS: Chromosomal microarray testing, trio exome sequencing, multigene panel sequencing and targeted sequencing of FOXP2 were performed in individuals with variable developmental disorders, and speech and language deficits.\r\n RESULTS: We identified four different truncating mutations, two novel missense mutations within the forkhead domain and an intragenic deletion in FOXP2 in 14 individuals from eight unrelated families. Mutations occurred de novo in four families and were inherited from an affected parent in the other four. All index patients presented with various manifestations of language and speech impairment. Apart from two individuals with normal onset of speech, age of first words was between 4 and 7\u2005years. Articulation difficulties such as slurred speech, dyspraxia, stuttering and poor pronunciation were frequently noted. Motor development was normal or only mildly delayed. Mild cognitive impairment was reported for most individuals.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: By identifying intragenic deletions or mutations in 14 individuals from eight unrelated families with variable developmental delay/cognitive impairment and speech and language deficits, we considerably broaden the mutational and clinical spectrum associated with aberrations in FOXP2.",

        "document": "Title: Sleep disturbances in young and middle-aged adults - Empirical patterns and related factors from an epidemiological survey\nAbstract: Background: Previous research suggests that sleep disorders are highly associated with other mental health problems. However, sleep problems even below the diagnostic threshold of sleep disorders are very common in the general population, which highly affects wellbeing and functioning. In order to broaden the focus beyond those severe cases we explored empirical patterns across the whole spectrum of sleep problems as well as associated clinical and other factors.\r\nMethod: A representative community sample of N=1274 residents from the canton of Zurich was interviewed for sleep problems and diagnostic criteria for mental disorders as well as was given a number of mental health-related psychometrical checklists. Based on a broader spectrum of sleep problems we conducted a latent class analysis (LCA) to derive distinct classes of such disturbances. Classes were compared regarding their associations to mental health-relevant and other risk factors.\r\nResults: The LCA revealed four classes - no sleep disturbances (72.6%), difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (15.8%), delayed sleep (5.3%), and severe sleep problems (6.4%). Severe sleep problems were related to female gender and generalized anxiety disorder, while depression was linked to all sleep problem classes. Persons with difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and severe sleep problems reported higher levels of psychopathology, burnout and neuroticism, while all sleep problem types were tied to stress-related variables, but not alcohol use disorder.\r\nDiscussion: Sleep problems are highly prevalent among the young and middle-aged adults in our representative sample of young and middle-aged adults and as such represent a serious public mental health problem. Our findings indicate sleep problems to have a multi-dimensional structure with some differential associations. While all subtypes were associated with poorer mental health and particularly more depression, severe sleep problems appeared to be the sleep subtype seen in agoraphobia and GAD, while delayed sleep had no specific associations. The variety of associations assessed leads one to assume that likewise a variety of sleep interventions is required.",

        "document": "Title: A Simple Macroeconomic Model with Extreme Financial Frictions\nAbstract: We develop a simple macroeconomic model with extreme financial frictions (no credit markets) and show that poverty traps can emerge even in the absence of leverage. In our model, farmers produce fruit by renting land from landlords. Crops are exposed to aggregate shocks (weather risk). To guarantee themselves a positive consumption level even after a bad crop, farmers store fruit as precautionary savings and adjust their scale of activity to the level of these savings. The land that is not rented to farmers is cultivated by landlords, who are less productive. We show that there is a unique Markov competitive equilibrium, in which the rental price of land increases with the level of farmers\u2019 savings. A decline in savings, caused by a bad crop, may bring the economy into a \u201dpoverty trap\u201d, even in the absence of any leverage. Fluctuations of output are caused by productivity shocks and amplified by fluctuations in the level of activity of farmers. The simplicity of our model allows us to study analytically why the long run behavior of the economy may differ markedly from the one predicted by the steady state paradigm. Specifically, we show that when the risk-adjusted productivity of farmers is high and the elasticity of the land supply is low, using the steady state paradigm leads to serious mis-estimations of the long run average state of the economy.",

We present a case of a closed displaced avulsion fracture of the calcaneal tuberosity due to blunt trauma to the calf in a 74-year-old female. Open reduction and internal fixation with two 3.5-mm cannulated cortical screws with washers was performed, and anatomic reduction was achieved. Without further trauma, secondary displacement of the fracture occurred on day 3. Revision was performed with a single 3.5-mm cortical screw and transosseous fixation with 2 suture anchors, followed by partial weightbearing for 6 weeks. At 12 weeks postoperative, the fracture had completely healed, and she was doing well at 16 months after the revision surgery. Transosseous suture anchor fixation of an osteoporotic avulsion fracture of the calcaneal tuberosity seems to provide better and stronger fixation than that using lag screws.",

The insights we gained in Northern Potos\u00ed show that there are two major movements with divergent political visions (framed around class or \u201cpeasantness\u201d), and thus two long-term strategies for vivir bien. But both represent the same grassroots realities, and their communal leaders seek to apply similar practices (e.g. improving agricultural production or accessing off-farm employment in the mines of Mallku Khota). They also face the same difficulties\u2014leading to complaints from their constituencies about the lack of actual support in the productive sphere. We find that this contradiction between political influence and grassroots criticism emerges less from the movements\u2019 ideological struggles over agrarian change, and more from everyday problems, including the difficulties their local representatives face as part of the complex local administrative system, the persistence of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, and movements\u2019 obstructive practices of competition. Such mundane issues, we argue, are as important as issues of ideology\r\nin debates about agrarian/rural struggles.",

Virtually all capitalist economies grapple with challenges of demographic change, slow economic growth, poor employment performance and increasing poverty rates. In dealing with these problems, a social investment strategy appeals to a wide audience, both political and academic. However, social investment reforms and performances in democratic countries around the globe are highly unequal and remain fragmentary: different countries have implemented different types of policy instruments, with different functions, at different points in time, and to different degrees.\r\nDespite a growing number of scientific contributions on social investment reforms and their effects, a systematic mapping of the design of social investment agendas and policies in different democratic countries around the globe is still lacking. Moreover, we lack an explanation for the variance in the development of social investment policy reforms. This is where we locate the research interest of the project presented in this paper. In order to understand why social investment agendas and policies have developed differently across countries, we need to study the politics of social investment reforms. Thus, we ask: How do social investment agendas and social investment policy reforms vary across democratic countries around the globe? Under what political conditions do social investment agendas and/or reforms develop? \r\nIn this paper, we situate these questions in the existing state of the literature, and we outline a way to answer these research questions in the context of social policy reforms in Latin America, East Asia, as well as Western and Eastern Europe. We argue that political coalitions (actors and their interests), as well as the institutional embeddedness of social investment politics are key factors in explaining the high variety of social investment agendas and policies between countries.",

This thesis addresses the question of why child care teachers choose to leave by investigating their job resources, job demands, burnout, turnover intention, and actual turnover. The four studies presented here use data of lead teachers, assistant teachers, and directors collected in two questionnaire-surveys in a Swiss community over the course of three years. Reported job demands and job resources were mainly associated with characteristics of the facility. Furthermore, lead teachers\u2019 experienced burnout symptoms were associated with perceived control, pay satisfaction, and the workload in the facility. Moreover, the wish to quit at the baseline predicted actual turnover three years later. However, the associations between job resources and turnover intention mediated by job satisfaction was stronger than the association between job demands and turnover intention mediated by burnout. Reasons for staying in the profession included the team, the children, joy, and a professional workplace. Reasons for leaving were unprofessional leadership, lack of advancement, poor working conditions, low wages and personal reasons. Overall, the findings imply that child care teachers are primarily motivated by intrinsic rewards (the children, the team), while a lack of extrinsic rewards (working conditions and wages, leadership) drives them out of the job and profession. The findings of the four studies combined with the international studies suggest that child care work is a profession at the margins.",

It is unclear, if this score is still relevant to contemporary cohorts of patients who receive modern-type chemotherapy and supportive care.\r\nPatients and Methods: All patients who underwent cisplatin/etoposide based first-line chemotherapy for mGCC at the University Hospital Zurich (USZ) between 1991 and 2016 were identified retrospectively. Clinical characteristics were extracted from medical charts and patients classified according to the IGCCCG score (J Clin Oncol 1997;15:594). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) probabilities at 5 years served as outcome parameters.\r\nResults: The study cohort consisted of 204 patients at a median age of 32 years and a median follow-up of 4.2 years. According to the IGCCCG score, PFS in the contemporary USZ cohort was 71% overall; 83% for good risk, 69% for intermediate risk and 30% for poor risk patients, p\u2009<\u20090.001. OS for the entire cohort was 88%. In respect to OS, we observed no difference between good risk and intermediate risk patients (94% vs. 91%, p\u2009=\u20090.62), but a statistically significant difference between those two risk groups and poor risk patients, who had an OS of only 65%, p\u2009<\u20090.001.\r\nConclusions: Within the contemporary USZ cohort of mGCC patients no improvements in PFS probabilities were observed compared to the ones predicted by the IGCCCG score for any prognostic category, but marked improvements in OS probabilities for intermediate risk and poor risk patients, possibly due to better salvage treatments.",

Only one treatment (praziquantel) is available, putting control efforts at risk should resistance occur. In pursuit of treatment alternatives, we derivatized an old antischistosomal agent, oxamniquine (OXA). Four organometallic derivatives of OXA were synthesized and tested against Schistosoma mansoni in vitro and in vivo. Of these, a ferrocenyl derivative, 1, killed larval and adult worms 24 h postexposure in vitro, in contrast to OXA, which lacks in vitro activity against adult worms. A dose of 200 mg/kg of 1 completely eliminated the worm burden in mice. Subsequently, a ruthenocenyl (5) and a benzyl derivative (6) of OXA were synthesized to probe the importance of the ferrocenyl group in 1. Compounds 1, 5, and 6 were lethal to both S. mansoni and S. haematobium adults in vitro. In vivo, at 100 mg/kg, all three compounds revealed S. mansoni worm burden reductions of 76 to 93%, commensurate with OXA. Our findings present three compounds with activity against S. mansoni in vitro, comparable activity in vivo, and high activity against S. haematobium in vitro. These compounds may possess a different binding mode or mode of action compared to OXA and present excellent starting points for further SAR studies.",

Participants in this study were 134 refugees resettled in Switzerland. Most participants were from Turkey, Iran, and Sri Lanka, and 92.7% had been exposed to torture. Self-report measures were implemented to assess PTSD, depression, mental and physical health-related quality of life (QoL), as well as pre- and postmigration experiences. Findings indicated that approximately half the sample met criteria for PTSD and depression, 33.6% met criteria for depression only, and only 2.2% met criteria for PTSD only. Several variables emerged as predictors of comorbidity in contrast to no diagnosis: female gender, odds ratio (OR) = 0.17; age, OR = 0.93; time in Switzerland, OR = 1.16; and trauma exposure, OR = 1.19. Postmigration stress was also associated with greater likelihood of comorbidity compared with no diagnosis, OR = 1.32, and a single diagnosis, OR = 1.14. Further, dual diagnosis was associated with significantly poorer mental health-related and physical health-related QoL (mental health-related QoL: dual diagnosis vs. single diagnosis, d = -0.52 and dual diagnosis vs. no diagnosis, d = -1.30; physical health-related QoL: dual diagnosis vs. single diagnosis, d = -0.73 and dual diagnosis vs. no diagnosis: d = -1.04). Findings indicated that comorbidity was highly prevalent in this sample of treatment-seeking refugees and was associated with a substantial impairment burden. Psychological interventions for refugees should consider the dual impact of PTSD and depression symptoms to optimally decrease distress and improve QoL in this vulnerable group.",

The present study aims to investigate independent risk factors for early surgical outcomes in patients with PVE.\r\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 8 Italian Cardiac Surgery Units from January 2000 to December 2013 by enrolling all PVE patients undergoing surgical treatment.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 209 consecutive patients were included in the study. During the study period, the global rate of surgical procedures for PVE among all operations for isolated or associated valvular disease was 0.45%. Despite its rarity this percentage increased significantly during the second time frame (2007-2013) in comparison with the previous one (2000-2006): 0.58% vs 0.31% (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Intraoperative and in-hospital mortality rates were 4.3% and 21.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis identified the following factors associated with in-hospital mortality: female gender [odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20094.62; P\u2009<\u20090.001], shock status (OR\u2009=\u20093.29; P\u2009=\u20090.02), previous surgical procedures within 3\u2009months from the treatment (OR\u2009=\u20093.57; P\u2009=\u20090.009), multivalvular involvement (OR\u2009=\u20098.04; P\u2009=\u20090.003), abscess (OR\u2009=\u20092.48; P\u2009=\u20090.03) and urgent surgery (OR\u2009=\u20096.63; P\u2009<\u20090.001).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite its rarity, PVE showed a significant increase over time. Up to now, in-hospital mortality after surgical treatment still remains high (>20%). Critical clinical presentation and extension of anatomical lesions are strong preoperative predictors for poor early outcome.",

Risk factors and quality of life determining clinical and neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age are examined. In a 2-center cohort study, 48 patients with SV morphology (26 hypoplastic left heart syndrome and 22 other types of univentricular heart defect) have been examined before Fontan procedure between 2010 and 2015. Patients were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Version (Bayley-III), and the Preschool Children Quality of Life (TAPQOL) questionnaire. A total of 44 patients underwent hybrid procedure (n\u2009=\u200925), Norwood procedure (n\u2009=\u20097), or shunt or banding procedure (n\u2009=\u200912) as first surgery before subsequent bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (n\u2009=\u200948). Median cognitive, language, and motor composite scores on the Bayley-III were 100 (range 65-120), 97 (68-124), and 97 (55-124), respectively. The language composite score was significantly below the norm (P\u2009=\u20090.025). Risk factors for poorer neurodevelopmental outcome were prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer days of hospital stay, and more reinterventions (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Parents reported a good quality of life for their children. Children undergoing Fontan procedure show a favorable development and good quality of life. More complicated postoperative course and reinterventions constitute risk factors for impaired neurodevelopment. Improving postoperative management and implementing routine follow-up assessments aremeasures to further improve the neurodevelopmental outcome of this high-risk patient population.",

This study gives a broad picture of the Ghanaian cocoa sector and examines the initiatives of two Swiss chocolate manufacturers aiming at a more sustainable and future-oriented cocoa production in Ghana.\r\nThe study reveals many challenges the Ghanaian cocoa sector is facing. The entire sector is highly regulated and controlled by the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD); the scope of influence of the private sector is limited. The COCOBOD shows rent-seeking behaviour and patronising attitudes. To attract investments from cocoa farmers, cocoa production would have to become a profitable business for them. The case study reveals that certification helps to increase both yields and income of the farmers. However, certification schemes are by far not sufficient to pull farmers out of poverty. As the projects of the two chocolate manufacturers focus on the diversification of the farmers\u2019 income, they have the potential to improve the livelihoods of farmers. Because chocolate manufacturers, through their core business activities, cannot directly interact with farmers given the state control of the sector, its development is limited. Large-scale improvements of the whole cocoa sector go beyond the sphere of influence of chocolate manufacturers and must come from the Ghanaian government.",

We explored the role of behavioral and structural determinants of these variations, by using a dataset covering 17 European countries in the period 1970-2010, and by conducting multilevel multivariate regression analyses. Our results suggest that between-country variations in inequalities in current mortality can partly be understood from variations in inequalities in smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and poverty. Also, countries with higher national income, higher quality of government, higher social transfers, higher health care expenditure and more self-expression values have smaller inequalities in mortality. Finally, trends in behavioral risk factors, particularly smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, appear to partly explain variations in inequalities in mortality trends. This study shows that analyses of variations in health inequalities between countries can help to identify entry-points for policy.",

Ultimate assignment to a group for the purpose of this analysis was made according to the group in which an infant spent the most days. Statistical analyses were performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Kruskal-Wallis test, the \u03c72 test, and the Fisher exact test as well as by multiple logistic regression.\r\nRESULTS: Of the 359 infants, 57 were classified as hypocapnic, 230 as normocapnic, 70 as hypercapnic, and 2 as fluctuating PCO2. Hypercapnic infants had a higher average product of mean airway pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen (MAP \u00d7 FiO2). For this group, mortality was higher, as was the likelihood of having moderate/severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and poorer neurodevelopment. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed an increased risk for BPD or death associated with birth weight (p < 0.001) and MAP \u00d7 FiO2 (p < 0.01). The incidence of adverse neurodevelopment was associated with birth weight (p < 0.001) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; p < 0.01).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Birth weight and respiratory morbidity, as measured by MAP \u00d7 FiO2, were the most predictive of death or BPD and NEC, whereas poor neurodevelopmental outcome was associated with low birth weight and IVH. Univariate models also identified PCO2. Thus, hypercapnia seems to reflect greater disease severity, a likely contributor to differences in outcomes.",

India, however, refers to its limited capacity and widespread poverty. Is India hiding behind its poor? While others examine the distribution of emissions within the country to answer this question, we study domestic policy making for energy subsidies and access to clean energy. Empirical evidence suggests that domestic policy making is at least partially consistent with the pro-poor arguments advanced at the international level. Given their large number and the country's democratic system, the poor do have some weight in Indian politics. However, pro-poor policies end where they do not translate into greater vote shares. Moreover, India's international position ignores the existing complementarities between climate-friendly and pro-poor activities.",

Such dichotomous diagnostic categories do not convey an individual's subtle gradations in the severity of the condition over time and have poor statistical power when used as an outcome measure in research. This prospective, international, multicenter study slightly modified and further evaluated the validity of the CRPS Severity Score (CSS), a continuous index of CRPS severity. Using a prospective design, medical evaluations were conducted in 156 patients with CRPS to compare changes over time in CSS scores between patients initiating a new treatment program and patients on stable treatment regimens. New vs stable categorizations were supported by greater changes in pain and function in the former. Results indicated that CSS values in the stable CRPS treatment group exhibited much less change over time relative to the new treatment group, with intraclass correlations nearly twice as large in the former. A calculated smallest real difference value revealed that a change in the CSS of \u22654.9 scale points would indicate real differences in CRPS symptomatology (with 95% confidence). Across groups, larger changes in CRPS features on the CSS over time were associated in the expected direction with greater changes in pain intensity, fatigue, social functioning, ability to engage in physical roles, and general well-being. The overall pattern of findings further supports the validity of the CSS as a measure of CRPS severity and suggests it may prove useful in clinical monitoring and outcomes research.",

The aim of this study is to compare unipolar voltage amplitudes (UnipV) with scar on delayed enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (DE-CMR).\r\nMETHODS: Heart failure patients who underwent DE-CMR and electro-anatomic mapping were included. Thirty-three endocardial mapped patients and 27 epicardial mapped patients were investigated. UnipV were computed peak-to-peak. Electrograms were matched with scar extent of the corresponding DE-CMR segment using a 16-segment/slice model. Non-scar was defined as 0% scar, while scar was defined as 1-100% scar extent.\r\nRESULTS: UnipVs were moderately lower in scar than in non-scar (endocardial 7.1 [4.6-10.6] vs. 10.3 [7.4-14.2] mV; epicardial 6.7 [3.6-10.5] vs. 7.8 [4.2-12.3] mV; both p<0.001). The correlation between UnipV and scar extent was moderate for endocardial (R = -0.33, p<0.001), and poor for epicardial measurements (R = -0.07, p<0.001). Endocardial UnipV predicted segments with >25%, >50% and >75% scar extent with AUCs of 0.72, 0.73 and 0.76, respectively, while epicardial UnipV were poor scar predictors, independent of scar burden (AUC = 0.47-0.56). UnipV in non-scar varied widely between patients (p<0.001) and were lower in scar compared to non-scar in only 9/22 (41%) endocardial mapped patients and 4/19 (21%) epicardial mapped patients with scar.\r\nCONCLUSION: UnipV are slightly lower in scar compared to non-scar. However, significant UnipV differences between and within patients and large overlap between non-scar and scar limits the reliability of accurate scar assessment, especially in epicardial measurements and in segments with less than 75% scar extent.",

We thus aimed to meta-analytically evaluate the evidence of frailty and pre-frailty as risk factors for CVD. Two reviewers selected all studies comparing data about CVD prevalence or incidence rates between frail/pre-frail vs. robust. The association between frailty status and CVD in cross-sectional studies was explored by calculating and pooling crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) \u00b195% confidence intervals (CIs); the data from longitudinal studies were pooled using the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Eighteen cohorts with a total of 31,343 participants were meta-analyzed. Using estimates from 10 cross-sectional cohorts, both frailty and pre-frailty were associated with higher odds of CVD than robust participants. Longitudinal data were obtained from 6 prospective cohort studies. After a median follow-up of 4.4 years, we identified an increased risk for faster onset of any-type CVD in the frail (HR=1.70 [95%CI, 1.18-2.45]; I2=66%) and pre-frail (HR=1.23 [95%CI, 1.07-1.36]; I2=67%) vs. robust groups. Similar results were apparent for time to CVD mortality in the frail and pre-frail groups. In conclusion, frailty and pre-frailty constitute addressable and independent risk factors for CVD in older adults.",

We investigated the outcome and potential independent risk factors on survival in recipients undergoing lung transplantation with intraoperative ECMO support.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of recipients were retrospectively evaluated (January 2000-December 2014). Retransplantation and bridge to transplantation on ECMO were excluded. Recipients (n = 291) were divided into 2 groups: those who needed intraoperative ECMO support (Group 1, n = 134) and those who did not receive intraoperative ECMO support (Group 2, n = 157). Independent risk factors were identified by a stepwise backward regression analysis.\r\nRESULTS: 1-year survival was 84.2% in Group 1 vs. 90.4% in Group 2, and 5-year survival was 52.8% in Group 1 vs. 70.5% in Group 2 (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis indicated that recipient age (p = 0.001), renal replacement therapy (p = 0.001) and intraoperative ECMO support (p = 0.03) were significant risk factors for overall survival. The rate of postoperative early surgical complications was comparable between the two groups (p = 0.09). The number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy and experiencing late pulmonary complications was significantly higher in Group 1 (p = 0.02).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that lung transplantation with intraoperative ECMO support is associated with poor outcomes.",

Does repair of mild-to-moderate insufficiency of the tricuspid valve (TV) in patients undergoing MV surgery lead to a benefit in early postoperative outcome? Methods\u2003A total of 22 patients with mild-to-moderate TR underwent MV repair and concomitant TV repair with Tri-Ad (Medtronic ATS Medical Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States) and Edwards Cosgrove (Edwards Lifesciences Irvine, California, United States) rings. The severity of TR was assessed echocardiographically by using color-Doppler flow images. The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) was under 1.7 cm. Additional procedures included coronary artery bypass (n\u2009=\u20099) and maze procedure (n\u2009=\u200915). The following parameters were compared: postoperative and peak dose of noradrenaline (NA), pre/postoperative systolic pulmonary pressure (sPAP), extubation time, operation time, cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, pre/postoperative ejection fraction (EF), intensive care unit (ICU)-stay, hospital stay, cell saver blood transfusion, intra/postoperative blood transfusion, and postoperative TR.

Dialysis is seldom considered a high priority by health care funders, consequently, few LMICs develop policies regarding dialysis allocation. Dialysis facilities may exist, but access remains highly inequitable in LMICs. High out-of-pocket payments make dialysis unsustainable and plunge many families into poverty. Patients, families, and clinicians suffer significant emotional and moral distress from daily life-and-death decisions imposed by dialysis. The health system's obligation to provide financial risk protection is an important component of global and national strategies to achieve universal health coverage. An ethical imperative therefore exists to develop transparent dialysis priority-setting guidelines to facilitate public understanding and acceptance of the realistic limits within the health system, and facilitate fair allocation of scarce resources. In this article, we present ethical challenges faced by patients, families, clinicians, and policy makers where dialysis is not universally accessible and discuss the potential ethical consequences of various dialysis allocation strategies. Finally, we suggest an ethical framework for use in policy development for priority setting of dialysis care. The accountability for reasonableness framework is proposed as a procedurally fair decision-making, priority-setting process.",

        "document": "Title: What Should the Serum Creatinine Be After Transplantation? An Approach to Integrate Donor and Recipient Information to Assess Posttransplant Kidney Function\nAbstract: BACKGROUND  Knowledge of an optimal expected serum creatinine (SCr) would be useful to detect early renal dysfunction after transplantation. Current measurements of posttransplant function rely on the recipient's SCr and calculations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), based on recipient age, weight, and sex. Renal function after transplantation, however, also depends on the donor supply of functioning nephrons and adaptation in GFR of a single kidney.  METHODS  We developed a formula to predict the optimal expected SCr after transplantation derived from donor and recipient Cockroft-Gault GFRs and adjusted for the single kidney adaptive response. We compared the expected SCr with the lowest observed SCr in a cohort of living (79) and deceased (67) donor allograft recipients followed up over 5 years.  RESULTS  Expected SCr correlated with the observed SCr in both living and deceased donor kidney recipients, correlation was stronger among living donor kidney recipients. Recipient-to-donor body weight ratio was significantly associated with the difference between expected and observed SCr, suggesting that recipient body weight is a major predictor of posttransplant renal function. The difference between expected and observed SCr was significantly greater among deceased donor kidney recipients, suggesting poorer function in these patients, which was not detected by SCr or estimated GFR alone.  CONCLUSIONS  Calculation of expected renal function for a given donor-recipient combination adds relevant information to assessment of allograft function. Future studies will permit determination of a threshold difference between expected and observed SCr that should trigger investigation and potential intervention to improve allograft function.",

Many studies have focused on low birth weight, prematurity and growth restriction as surrogate markers of an adverse intrauterine environment; however, high birth weight, exposure to maternal diabetes and rapid growth during early childhood are also emerging as developmental risk factors for chronic diseases. Altered programming of nephron number is an important link between exposure to developmental stressors and subsequent risk of hypertension and kidney disease. Maternal, fetal, and childhood nutrition are crucial contributors to these programming effects. Resource-poor countries experience the sequential burdens of fetal and childhood undernutrition and subsequent overnutrition, which synergistically act to augment the effects of developmental programming; this observation might explain in part the disproportionate burden of chronic disease in these regions. Numerous nutritional interventions have been effective in reducing the short-term risk of low birth weight and prematurity. Understanding the potential long-term benefits of such interventions is crucial to inform policy decisions to interrupt the developmental programming cycle and stem the growing epidemics of hypertension and kidney disease worldwide.",

We assessed agreement in lung clearance index (LCI) from two similar, commercial nitrogen MBW setups in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and controls.\r\nMETHODS: The EasyOne Pro (NDD) and Exhalyzer D (EM) were randomly applied in 85 adults (34 with CF) and 97 children (47 with CF and normal forced expiratory volume in one second). We assessed differences between setups in LCI, lung volumes and breathing pattern and diagnostic performance for detecting abnormal lung function.\r\nRESULTS: Compared to NDD, EM measured higher LCI, functional residual capacity and cumulative expired volume while respiratory rate was lower. Mean difference (limits of agreement) in LCI was 1.30 (-2.34 to 4.94). In CF, prevalence of abnormal LCI was greater in children and similar in adults using EM compared to NDD.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Agreement of MBW outcomes between setups is poor and explained by nitrogen measurement techniques and breathing pattern.",

Thus, we aimed to determine the impact of clinical and laboratory factors on antibiotic prescribing in children and adolescents with febrile LRTI.\r\nMETHODS: Pediatric patients from the standard care control group of a randomized controlled trial (ProPAED) investigating procalcitonin guided antibiotic treatment in febrile LRTI were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis to evaluate the impact of laboratory and clinical factors on antibiotic prescribing.\r\nRESULTS: The standard care control group of the ProPAED study comprised 165 LRTI patients (median age: 2.7 years, range: 0.1-16), out of which 88 (55%) received antibiotic treatment. Factors significantly associated with antibiotic prescribing in patients with complete clinical and laboratory documentation (n = 158) were C-reactive protein (OR 5.8 for a 10-fold increase, 95%CI 2.2-14.9), white blood count beyond age-dependent reference range (OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.4-11.4), body temperature (OR 1.7 for an increase by 1\u00b0C, 95%CI 1.02-2.68), and pleuritic pain (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.1-7.6). Dyspnea (OR 0.3, 95%CI 0.1-0.7) and wheezing (OR 0.3, 95%CI 0.13-0.95) were inversely associated with antibiotic prescribing.\r\nCONCLUSION: Laboratory markers were strong drivers of antibiotic prescribing in children with febrile lower respiratory tract infections, in spite of their known poor prediction of antibiotic need. Building on current guidelines for antibiotic treatment in children with febrile LRTI, a reliable decision algorithm for safe antibiotic withholding considering the laboratory and clinical factors evaluated in this study has the potential to further reduce antibiotic prescribing.",

He we report on the first population-based, epidemiological analysis of patients diagnosed with MDS in Switzerland between 2001 and 2012. The aim of this study was to characterize the extent and limitations of currently available population-based, epidemiological data and formulate recommendations for future health services research. The investigated outcomes comprised trends of annual case frequency, classification of morphological subtypes, incidence, mortality and survival. Annual case frequency increased by 20% (from 263 to 315 cases per year), whereas age-standardized incidence-/mortality-rates remained stable (2.5/1.1 per 100'000 person-years). This observation reflects population growth as well as higher diagnostic awareness and not an increase of age-specific risk. However, it will inevitably influence the future prevalence of MDS and the impact on healthcare systems. Reporting of classification in MDS subtypes was poor with modest improvement from 20% to 39% and increased awareness for mainly higher-risk diseases. Relative survival for all patients at 5-years (RS) ranged between 37 and 40%. Significant better RS was found for younger compared to older higher-risk MDS patients (48% vs. 17%), reflecting the effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. However, no survival advantage was found in elderly patients after introduction of hypomethylating agents as standard for care in this patient group. Our data is in line with results from other MDS and cancer registries. It allows formulating recommendations for future collaborative health services research on MDS patients with national and international partners.",

This assumption contributes largely to the pervasive idea that listeners\u2019 ability to recognize vowels has to be poor at very high fundamental frequencies (f o ) due to a sparse sampling of the vocal tract transfer function. In this cumulative thesis, it is shown that the phonological function of vowels can be maintained at f o s up to at least 880 Hz and that listeners can identify the point vowels /i a u/ at even higher f o s. Auditory excitation patterns revealed highly di\ufb00erentiable representations for these categories that can be used as landmarks for vowel category perception at high f o s. The results suggest that theories of vowel perception based on overall spectral shape will provide a fuller account of vowel perception than those based solely on formant frequency patterns",

Several surgical techniques for left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion have evolved over the past decades. Surgeons have been using different techniques leading to highly variable and, in particular, poor data on outcomes. LAA closure is performed either as a\u00a0concomitant procedure during open-heart surgery or as a\u00a0stand-alone surgical procedure as part of minimally invasive (mini-thoracotomy or thoracoscopy) arrhythmia surgery. Data on the safety and feasibility of surgical LAA occlusion are derived mainly from nonrandomized case series, observational and cohort studies, or registries with mostly inconclusive and conflicting results. Increased awareness of the high failure rates in attaining complete LAA occlusion, thus avoiding poor surgical techniques (e.\u2009g., simple suture ligation, endocardial suturing etc.), and the availability of newer devices (e.\u2009g., AtriClip device) have recently led to improved surgical results in the literature. If further validated in large-scale studies, these recent promising developments in the field of surgical LAA treatment seem to offer alternatives for patients ineligible for oral anticoagulation therapy with vitamin\u00a0K antagonists or newer non-vitamin-K-dependent oral anticoagulants.",

The main risk factors for epilepsy after cerebral infection, besides acute seizures, are infection-associated brain lesions and status epilepticus during the acute phase. Despite the high prevalence of pharmacoresistant epilepsies after cerebral infections, especially in patients with MRI-identifiable lesions, only a small minority undergoes epilepsy surgery. However, excellent surgical candidates are particularly those with a history of meningitis or encephalitis in early childhood, hippocampal sclerosis on MRI, as well as a history, seizure semiology, and EEG-findings compatible with the diagnosis of a mesial temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome. More challenging are patients with neocortical/extratemporal lobe epilepsies post cerebral infection. Finally, patients with a severe hemispheric injury with contralateral hemiparesis are candidates for hemispherectomy/hemispherotomy. This review attempts to shed some light on this frequent cause of symptomatic focal epilepsy, with an emphasis on the chances offered by epilepsy surgery.",

Extant attempts to explain why moderate left parties that resemble the traditional social democratic mass parties have emerged in some countries, and populist left parties in others have been inconclusive. I argue that populist anti-establishment mobilization falls on fruitful ground where party systems do not adequately represent citizen preferences. This is a necessary, though not a sufficient condition for populist success. Combining data on party positions with mass-level surveys for two cases where new anti-establishment parties that have been successful and two cases of failure, I analyze how well parties represent voters along the two most salient dimensions of political competition in Latin America: the economic antagonism between state and market, and the regime dimension that pits democrats (or those in favor of deepening democracy) against those holding positive evaluations of past military dictatorships. At the party level, I use data from the Salamanca Parliamentary Elites Surveys (PELA) and from the Brazilian Legislative Surveys. At the voter level, I rely on the World Values Survey (WVS) and the Latinobar\u00f3metro surveys. I first locate parties and voters on the dimensions mentioned above and then use an innovative measure to assess party system responsiveness.\r\nThe paper shows that party systems in Venezuela and Bolivia lacked responsiveness prior to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Evo Morales\u2019 successful bids for the presidency. In Chile, and to a lesser degree in Brazil, on the other hand, the close correspondence between voter preferences and party positions along the economic and political regime divides explains why new anti-establishment actors have not been successful. Looking at the evolution of party system responsiveness during the \u201cleft turn\u201d questions the simple dichotomization of left parties into moderate and populist camps, however. While responsiveness improved substantially after the emergence of the Movement for Socialism (MAS) in Bolivia, it remains poor in Venezuela after Ch\u00e1vez came to power. Likewise, there are persistent differences in terms of representation in Chile and Brazil, both of which belong to the moderate left group. \r\nBeyond the initial expectations, the results thus show two pathways of the left to power in Latin America in the new millennium: A programmatic or \u201csegmented\u201d and a \u201cmajoritarian\u201d path. Populist actors clearly pursue majoritarian strategies, but some non-populist actors do as well, as the Brazilian case shows.",

        "document": "Title: Chemical enrichment of stars due to accretion from the ISM during the Galaxy's assembly\nAbstract: Using the Eris zoom-in cosmological simulation of assembly of a Milky Way analogue, we study the chemical enrichment of stars due to accretion of metal-enriched gas from the interstellar medium (ISM) during the Galaxy's development. We consider metal-poor and old stars in the Galactic halo and bulge through the use of stellar orbits, gas density and metallicity distributions in Eris. Assuming spherically symmetric Bondi\u2013Hoyle accretion, we find that halo and bulge stars accrete metals at the rate of about $10^{\u221224}$ and $10^{\u221222} M\\odot yr^{\u22121}$, respectively, at redshifts $z \\lesssim 3$, but this accretion rate increases roughly a hundred-fold to about $10^{\u221220} M\\odot yr^{\u22121}$ at higher redshifts due to increased gas density. Bulge and halo stars accrete similar amounts of metals at high redshifts when kinematically distinct bulge and halo have not yet developed, and both sets of stars encounter a similar metal distribution in the ISM. Accretion alone can enrich main-sequence stars up to [Fe/H] $\\sim$ \u22122 in extreme cases, with the median enrichment level due to accretion of about [Fe/H] $\\sim$ \u22126 to \u22125. Because accretion mostly takes place at high redshifts, it is $\\alpha$-enriched to [$\\alpha$/Fe] $\\sim$ 0.5. We find that accretive metal enrichment is sufficient to affect the predicted metallicity distribution function of halo stars at [Fe/H] < \u22125. This can hinder attempts to infer natal chemical environment of metal-poor stars from their observed enrichment. Peculiar enrichment patterns such as those predicted to arise from pair-instability supernovae could help in disentangling the natal and accreted metal content of stars.",

Follow-up assessment included standardized neurologic, motor, and cognitive tests. Variables were collected prospectively, and multiple regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for adverse outcome.\r\nRESULTS .The mean patient age at assessment was 6.3 years (range, 5.1-6.8 years). IQ was lower in children with a genetic disorder (median, 55; range, 17-115) compared with children without a genetic disorder (median, 95; range, 47-135; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Cognitive and motor performance also were lower in children without a genetic disorder compared with the norm (P\u2009<\u2009.01 for both). The prevalence of children without a genetic disorder performing below -2 SD (IQ 70) was higher than the norm (5.3% vs 2.3%; P\u2009=\u2009.008), and the prevalence of poor motor performance (<10th percentile) ranged from 21.2% to 41.1% (P\u2009<\u2009.01 for all). Significant independent risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental outcome included a genetic disorder, longer length of intensive care stay, lower birth weight, postoperative seizures, and lower socioeconomic status.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Current cohorts of children with CHD undergoing CPB show favorable outcomes but remain at risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, particularly those with a genetic disorder and a complicated postoperative course. Close neurodevelopmental surveillance is necessary to provide early therapeutic support.",

Plant fitness and growth will be determined by how plants interact with each other at smaller scales. Local-scale neighbourhood interactions may be altered by environmental pertubations, which could fundamentally affect community structure. This study examined the effects of seven years of experimental warming and nutrient addition on overall changes in the community structure and patterns of interspecific interaction between neighbouring plant species in two contrasting alpine plant communities, mesic meadow and poor heath, in subarctic Sweden. We used a network approach to quantify the dissimilarity of plant interaction networks and the average number of interspecific neighbourhood interactions over time in response to different environmental perturbations. The results revealed that combined warming and nutrient addition had significant negative effects on how dissimilar plant interaction networks were over time compared with the control. Moreover, plant\u2013plant neighbourhood interaction networks were more dissimilar over time in nutrient-poor heath than in nutrient-rich mesic meadow. In addition, nutrient addition alone and combined nutrient addition and warming significantly affected neighbourhood species interactions in both plant communities. Surprisingly, changes in interspecific neighbourhood interactions over time in both communities were very similar, suggesting that the nutrient-poor heath is as robust to experimental environmental perturbation as the mesic meadow. Comparisons of changes in neighbouring species interactions with changes in evenness and richness at the same scale, in order to determine whether diversity drove such changes in local-scale interaction patterns, provided moderate evidence that diversity was behind the changes in local-scale interspecific neighbourhood interactions. This implied that species might interact at smaller scales than those at which community measures were made. Overall, these results demonstrated that global change involving increased nutrient deposition and warming is likely to affect species interactions and alter community structure in plant communities, whether rich or poor in nutrients and species.",

        "document": "Title: Bilateral congenital deafness: What investigations should be performed?\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The introduction of newborn hearing screening has led to earlier identification of children with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Aetiological clarification offers several benefits. There is currently a lack of agreement on which examinations should be recommended.\r\nOBJECTIVE: Descriptive review of the literature reporting investigations performed to establish the aetiology of congenital SNHL and comparison of the management policy in Swiss referral centres.\r\nMETHODS: PubMed Search from 1985 to March 2016 with specific search terms; study selection according to inclusion/exclusion criteria; narrative analysis by use of defined criteria and question-naire.\r\nRESULTS: Ninety-two studies were finally included in this review. Forty studies investigated more than a single aetiology. Overall frequencies of aetiological parameters investigated were: genetic (47 studies), radiological (35), ophthalmic (35), serological (32), cardiac (25), renal (14), endocrine (12), neurological (8). Most of the studies were retrospective and various limitations such as poor population description, incomplete data or deficiencies in methodological quality were frequently detected. The variability detected in the investigative approach chosen by Swiss referral centres reflects the heterogeneous data seen in the literature.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The evidence in the literature regarding an appro-priate evaluation is mostly of low quality and difficult to assess owing to high heterogeneity. Nevertheless, imaging, genetic testing, neuropaediatric and ophthalmological evaluations, electrocardiograms and cytomegalovirus analysis have been identified as examinations to be included in the assessment of children with congenital SNHL. There is a need for international consensus on the various issues of such an evaluation, such as choice of investigations and diagnostic criteria.",

Multivariate regression analysis identified in particular MK+ (n=22) as a new independent risk factor for poor event-free survival (EFS 23\u00b19% vs 53\u00b12% for all other patients, P=0.0003), even after exclusion of four patients with monosomy 7 (EFS 28\u00b111%, P=0.0081). CK+ patients without MK had a better prognosis (n=47, EFS 47\u00b18%, P=0.46) than those with MK+ (n=12, EFS 25\u00b113%, P=0.024). HK+ (n=37, EFS 44\u00b18% for total cohort, P=0.3) influenced outcome only when t(8;21) patients were excluded (remaining n=16, EFS 9\u00b18%, P<0.0001). An extremely poor outcome was observed for MK+/HK+ patients (n=10, EFS 10\u00b110%, P<0.0001). Finally, isolated trisomy 8 was also associated with low EFS (n=16, EFS 25\u00b111%, P=0.0091). In conclusion, monosomal karyotype is a strong and independent predictor for high-risk pediatric AML. In addition, isolated trisomy 8 and hypodiploidy without t(8;21) coincide with dismal outcome. These results have important implications for risk stratification and should be further validated in independent pediatric cohorts.",

We compared adherence to national dietary recommendations between CCS, their siblings and the Swiss population, identified determinants of adherence, and assessed the association of adherence with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles.\r\nMETHODS: As part of the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (SCCSS), a questionnaire was sent to all Swiss resident CCS aged <21 years at diagnosis, who survived \u22655 years and were 16-45 years old at the time of the survey. We compared dietary adherence between CCS, their siblings and participants in the Swiss Health Survey (SHS), a representative survey of the general population. A multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with dietary adherence. We sorted CCS into four kinds of CVD risk groups based on type of treatment (anthracyclines, chest irradiation, a combination, or neither).\r\nRESULTS: We included 1864 CCS, 698 siblings and 8258 participants of the general population. Only 43% of the CCS met the recommended dietary intakes for meat, 34% for fruit, 30% for fish, 18% for dairy products, 11% for vegetables, and 7% for combined fruit and vegetables. Results were similar for both control groups. In all groups, dietary adherence was associated with gender, parental education, migration background, language region in Switzerland, smoking, alcohol consumption and sport participation. CCS with a higher CVD risk profile because of cardiotoxic treatment had no better adherence.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: CCS have similar food patterns as their siblings and the general population, and poorly adhere to current recommendations. Awareness of the importance of a healthy diet should be raised among CCS, to prevent chronic diseases like CVD.",

Evidence from greying India\nAbstract: Whether social transfers should be targeted or universal is an unsolved debate influencing the implementation of social protection schemes in developing countries. While the limited availability of public resources encourages targeting, the difficulty to identify the poor promotes a universal allocation. To address this question, this study examines the targeting performance of India\u2019s social pension scheme and the factors associated with access in 2004-05 and 2011-12, a time period of important reforms addressing social pension coverage and amount. The analysis shows that the reforms had limited success: The share of elderly poor not receiving social pensions decreased, but at the same time the share of elderly non-poor receiving social pensions slightly increased. Compared to a random allocation of social pensions , the benefits from targeting are very low despite of the implemented eligibility reforms. As intended by the reforms, holding a Below Poverty Line ration card has become the primary determinant of access to social pensions. However, this result holds also for non-poor individuals who exploit the unwarranted possession of a Below Poverty Line ration card to obtain social pension benefits. Even though the reforms were intended to make the beneficiary selection more transparent, the empirical results indicate that after the reforms individuals who have direct connections to local government officials are more likely to access social pension benefits.",

Based on the review of the equity and cost-effectiveness literature and relevant policy documents, we identify three indicators for equity (vulnerability level, poverty, number of beneficiaries), and three indicators for cost-effectiveness (economic savings in absolute and relative terms, human lives saved). Applying these simple indicators to information provided in 16 project documents considered by the Adaptation Fund Board (AFB) in 2011, we find that projects approved by the AFB rank high according to one cost-effectiveness indicator (absolute economic savings), while they rather rank low according to all equity and further cost-effectiveness indicators. Furthermore, we analyse whether \u2018equity\u2019 and \u2018cost-effectiveness\u2019 are two contradicting principles, or if ways can be found to reconcile both principles in multilateral adaptation finance. We conclude from both theory and the 16 analysed projects that a pure economic definition of cost-effectiveness is in contradiction with equity but trade-offs between equity and cost-effectiveness can be limited if relative wealth savings, and other indicators, e.g. human health, are used as indicator for cost-effectiveness.",

While the burden of CKD is reasonably well defined in developed countries, increasing evidence indicates that the CKD burden may be even greater in developing countries. Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are major contributors to the global burden of the disease and are important traditional CKD risk factors; however, nontraditional CKD risk factors such as nephrotoxin exposure, kidney stones, fetal and maternal factors, infections, environmental factors, and acute kidney injury are also increasingly being recognized as major threats to global kidney health. A broad approach to CKD prevention begins with the identification of CKD risk factors in the population, followed by the development of appropriate mitigation strategies. Effective prevention policies rely on an accurate understanding of the incidence and prevalence of CKD in a given setting, as well as the distribution and burden of risk factors. Populations or individuals at CKD risk must be screened and treated early to prevent the onset of and delay the progression of the kidney disease. Systematically collected data should be analyzed at country, province, and district levels to identify regional disparities and CKD hotspots and develop targeted prevention strategies. Race-ethnicity, genetics, sex, socioeconomic status, and geography are likely modifiers of CKD risk. A comprehensive, informed approach to prevention that takes into account all of these factors is therefore required to successfully tackle the global CKD epidemic.",

Position statement on behalf of the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology\nAbstract: There is an unmet need for effective treatment strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Until recently, attention in patients with HFpEF was almost exclusively focused on the left side. However, it is now increasingly recognized that right heart dysfunction is common and contributes importantly to poor prognosis in HFpEF. More insights into the development of right heart dysfunction in HFpEF may aid to our knowledge about this complex disease and may eventually lead to better treatments to improve outcomes in these patients. In this position paper from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, the Committee on Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction reviews the prevalence, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of right heart dysfunction and failure in patients with HFpEF. Finally, potential treatment strategies, important knowledge gaps and future directions regarding the right side in HFpEF are discussed.",

Recently completed double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying HF patients with ID have shown improvements in functional capacity, symptoms and quality of life when treated with i.v. ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). This individual patient data meta-analysis investigates the effect of FCM vs. placebo on recurrent hospitalisations and mortality in HF patients with ID.\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS Individual patient data were extracted from four RCTs comparing FCM with placebo in patients with systolic HF and ID. The main outcome measures were recurrent cardiovascular (CV) hospitalisations and CV mortality. Other outcomes included cause-specific hospitalisations and death. The main analyses of recurrent events were backed up by time-to-first-event analyses. In total, 839 patients, of whom 504 were randomised to FCM, were included. Compared with those taking placebo, patients on FCM had lower rates of recurrent CV hospitalisations and CV mortality [rate ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.88; P = 0.009]. Treatment with FCM also reduced recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV mortality (rate ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.33-0.86; P = 0.011) and recurrent CV hospitalisations and all-cause mortality (rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.88; P = 0.009). Time-to-first-event analyses showed similar findings, with somewhat attenuated treatment effects. The administration of i.v. FCM was not associated with an increased risk for adverse events.\r\nCONCLUSIONS Treatment with i.v.

The present subanalysis of the Echocardiography Guided CRT trial investigated the prognostic value of LV GLS in patients with narrow QRS complex.\r\nMethods and results: Left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) was measured on the apical 2-, 4- and 3-chamber views using speckle tracking analysis. Measurement of baseline LV GLS was feasible in 755 patients (374 with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)-ON and 381 with CRT-OFF). The median value of LV GLS in the overall population was 7.9%, interquartile range 6.2\u201310.1%. After a mean follow-up period of 19.4 months, 95 patients in the CRT-OFF group and 111 in the CRT-ON group reached the combined primary endpoint of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization. Each 1% absolute unit decrease in LV GLS was independently associated with 11% increase in the risk to reach the primary endpoint (Hazard ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval 95% 1.04\u20131.17, P\u2009<\u20090.001), after adjusting for ischaemic cardiomyopathy and randomization treatment among other clinically relevant variables. When categorizing patients according to quartiles of LV GLS, the primary endpoint occurred more frequently in patients in the lowest quartile (<6.2%) treated with CRT-ON vs. CRT-OFF (45.6% vs. 28.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.009) whereas, no differences were observed in patients with LV GLS\u2009\u22656.2% treated with CRT-OFF vs. CRT-ON (23.7% vs. 24.5%, respectively; P \u2009=\u20090.62).\r\nConclusion: Low LV GLS is associated with poor outcome in heart failure patients with QRS width\u2009<130\u2009ms, independent of randomization to CRT or not. Importantly, in the group of patients with the lowest LV GLS quartile, CRT may have a detrimental effect on clinical outcomes.",

In some instances, implants are the largest component of total procedure cost, yet previous studies reveal that surgeons' knowledge of implant prices is poor. Our study aims to (1) understand drivers behind implant selection and (2) assess whether educating surgeons about implant costs affects implant selection.  METHODS  We surveyed 226 orthopedic surgeons across 6 continents. The survey presented 8 clinical cases of upper extremity fractures with history, radiographs, and implant options. Surgeons were randomized to receive either a version with each implant's average selling price (\"price-aware\" group), or a version without prices (\"price-na\u00efve\" group). Surgeons selected a surgical implant and ranked factors affecting implant choice. Descriptive statistics and univariate, multivariable, and subgroup analyses were performed.  RESULTS  For cases offering implants within the same class (eg, volar locking plates), price-awareness reduced implant cost by 9% to 11%. When offered different models of distal radius volar locking plates, 25% of price-na\u00efve surgeons selected the most expensive plate compared with only 7% of price-aware surgeons. For cases offering different classes of implants (eg, plate vs external fixator), there was no difference in implant choice between price-aware and price-na\u00efve surgeons. Familiarity with the implant was the most common reason for choosing an implant in both groups (35% vs 46%). Price-aware surgeons were more likely to rank cost as a factor (29% vs 21%).  CONCLUSIONS  Price awareness significantly influences surgeons' choice of a specific model within the same implant class. Merely including prices with a list of implants leads surgeons to select less expensive implants. This implies that an untapped opportunity exists to reduce surgical expenditures simply by enhancing surgeons' cost awareness.  TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE  Economic/Decision Analyses I.",

METHOD:   MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Cochrane and PEDro databases were systematically searched up to July 2016. Two independent raters scored the methodological quality in accordance to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. The overall level of evidence was scored according to Cochrane criteria.  RESULTS:   We identified 3590 studies, of which 17 were included. COSMIN scores ranged from 'poor' to 'excellent' for studies investigating measurement properties of the Selective Motor Control test, modified Trost test, Gillette's Selective Motor Control test, Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE), kinematic measures, electromyography, and torque steadiness. Studies assessing the SCALE scored highest on COSMIN items. Evidence levels for SCALE's validity and reliability properties were moderate, while for the other SVMC measures these ranged from unknown to moderate. Responsiveness was not assessed.

There are no reports on the epidemiology of fractures in a heterogeneous equine population.\r\nOBJECTIVES: To study the epidemiology of fractures in a heterogeneous equine population, focusing on differences between fractures resulting from a kick and fractures, resulting from other causes and investigating predictors for recovery.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.\r\nMETHODS: Data of all equids presented to the Equine Department, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich between 1990 and 2014 and diagnosed with a fracture were reviewed and those with a known cause were included in this study. Mann-Whitney and chi-squared tests were used to compare recovery rates of fractures resulting from a kick and fractures resulting from other causes, and a logistic regression was carried out for multivariate analysis of the most important factors affecting recovery.\r\nRESULTS: Here, 1144 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of all fractures (with a known cause), 43.6% were the result of a kick from another equid. Kicks often produced open fractures (44.7%) that involved bones of the limbs (85.6%). Overall recovery was 70.1%. Logistic regression showed that high-grade lameness accompanying the fracture and severe comminution negatively affected recovery.\r\nMAIN LIMITATIONS: The equids in this study were drawn from a referred population, which likely precluded the inclusion of both minor fractures and catastrophic fractures that necessitated immediate euthanasia. Moreover, many cases were excluded because the cause of the fracture could not be determined from the patient record.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Kicks are the most common cause of fractures in a heterogeneous equine population and measures to reduce the incidence of kicks are necessary in group-housing systems.",

We sought to derive an easy-to-use clinical score to help physicians identify elderly patients with VTE who are at high-risk of bleeding during extended anticoagulation (>3 months). Our derivation sample included 743 patients aged \u226565 years with VTE who were enrolled in a prospective multicenter cohort study. All patients received extended anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. We derived our score using competing risk regression, with the time to a first major bleeding up to 36 months of extended anticoagulation as the outcome, and 17 candidate variables as predictors. We used bootstrapping methods for internal validation. Sixty-six (9\u2009%) patients suffered major bleeding. The clinical score is based on seven clinical factors (previous bleeding, active cancer, low physical activity, anemia, thrombocytopenia, antiplatelet drugs/NSAIDs, and poor INR control). Overall, 48\u2009% of patients were classified as low-risk, 37\u2009% as moderate-risk, and 15\u2009% as high-risk of bleeding. The rate of major bleeding was 1.4 events in low-risk, 5.0 events in moderate-risk, and 12.2 events per 100 patient-years in high-risk patients. The c-statistic was 0.78 at 3 months and 0.71 at 36 months of extended anticoagulation. Model calibration was excellent (p=0.93). Internal validation showed similar results. This simple clinical score accurately identified elderly patients with VTE who are at high risk of major bleeding and who may not benefit from extended anticoagulation. Further validation of the score is important before its implementation into practice. The study is registered to https://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00973596.",

Understanding mechanisms of resistance and identifying effective therapeutic alternatives is one of the most important scientific challenges in melanoma. Using proteomics, we want to specifically gain insight into the pathophysiological process of cerebral metastases.\r\nMethods: Cerebral metastases from melanoma patients were initially analyzed by a LC-MS shotgun approach performed on a QExactive HF hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer. For further validation steps after bioinformatics analysis, a targeted LC-QQQ-MS approach, as well as Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry was performed.\r\nResults: In this pilot study, we were able to identify 5977 proteins by LC-MS analysis (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD007592). Based on PFS, samples were classified into good responders (PFS\u2009\u2265\u20096\u00a0months) and poor responders (PFS\u00a0[Formula: see text]\u00a03\u00a0months). By evaluating these proteomic profiles according to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG pathways and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we could characterize differences between the two distinct groups. We detected an EMT feature (up-regulation of N-cadherin) as classifier between the two groups, V-type proton ATPases, cell adhesion proteins and several transporter and exchanger proteins to be significantly up-regulated in poor responding patients, whereas good responders showed an immune activation, among other features. We identified class-discriminating proteins based on nearest shrunken centroids, validated and quantified this signature by a targeted approach and could correlate parts of this signature with resistance using the CPL/MUW proteome database and survival of patients by TCGA analysis. We further validated an EMT-like signature as a major discriminator between good and poor responders on primary melanoma cells derived from cerebral metastases. Higher immune activity is demonstrated in patients with good response to MAPKi by immunohistochemical staining of biopsy samples of cerebral melanoma metastases.\r\nConclusions: Employing proteomic analysis, we confirmed known extra-cerebral resistance mechanisms in the cerebral metastases and further discovered possible brain specific mechanisms of drug efflux, which might serve as treatment targets or as predictive markers for these kinds of metastasis.",

Objectives To evaluate intrarater and interrater agreement among physical therapists with different clinical experience in performing a visual rating of movement-pattern quality of patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome using a semi-quantitative scale. Background Visual rating of movement patterns in patients with FAI syndrome is of interest, because poor control of dynamic hip motion is frequently noted. Methods A video camera was used to record the performance of 34 patients with FAI syndrome performing single-limb standing, squat, frontal lunge, hop lunge, bridge, and plank. Visual rating of movement, as recorded on video, was performed by a highly experienced, a moderately experienced, and a novice physical therapist on 2 occasions using a semi-quantitative scale. Hip abductor strength was assessed using dynamometry, and hip pain and function were assessed with a patient-reported questionnaire. Intrarater and interrater agreement among physical therapists was evaluated using Gwet's agreement coefficient 1. Construct validity was evaluated as the association between physical therapists' rating and patients' hip abductor strength, pain, and function. Results Good intrarater and interrater agreement was observed in the highly experienced and moderately experienced physical therapists when rating single-limb standing, bridge, and plank. Poor to moderate intrarater and interrater agreement was found when they rated squat, frontal lunge, and hop lunge. Poor performers, as rated by the highly experienced physical therapist only, demonstrated lower hip abductor strength (P<.05), and similar hip pain and hip function compared to those of good performers. Conclusion Movement-pattern quality of patients with FAI syndrome should be rated by a highly experienced physical therapist.

We find that extreme income inequality in winner-take-all competitions is commonly accepted in our sample of 4,000 participants from the general population of the U.S., even when the winner outperforms the runner-up by the smallest possible margin. Generally, fairness judgements are only weakly influenced by the winning margin, which reveals that the mere fact of winning - be it by a tiny margin or by a substantial gap - justifies resulting inequalities. Our results improve understanding of public attitudes toward fairness and redistributive policies in winner-take-all competitions marked by extreme income inequalities.",

Neuroimaging and behavioural studies have established that impaired audiovisual integration of letters and speech sounds is a core deficit in individuals with developmental dyslexia. This longitudinal study aimed to identify neural and behavioural markers of audiovisual integration that are related to future reading fluency. We simulated the first step of reading acquisition by performing artificial-letter training with prereading children at risk for dyslexia. Multiple logistic regressions revealed that our training provides new precursors of reading fluency at the beginning of reading acquisition. In addition, an event-related potential around 400\u2009ms and functional magnetic resonance imaging activation patterns in the left planum temporale to audiovisual correspondences improved cross-validated prediction of future poor readers. Finally, an exploratory analysis combining simultaneously acquired electroencephalography and hemodynamic data suggested that modulation of temporoparietal brain regions depended on future reading skills. The multimodal approach demonstrates neural adaptations to audiovisual integration in the developing brain that are related to reading outcome. Despite potential limitations arising from the restricted sample size, our results may have promising implications both for identifying poor-reading children and for monitoring early interventions.",

We estimate historical and option-implied value at risk and iVaR for several popular jump models using the Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) 100 Index and American options. Empirically disentangling the contribution of the jumps from the contribution of the diffusion, we conclude that jumps account for about 90% of the iVaR on average.

        "document": "Title: Pulmonary hypertension in aortic and mitral valve disease\nAbstract: In patients with aortic and/or mitral valve disease the presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) indicates a decompensated state of the disease with left ventricular and left atrial dysfunction and exhausted compensatory mechanism, i.e., a state of heart failure. Pulmonary hypertension in this context is the consequence of the backwards transmission of elevated left atrial pressure. In this form of PH, pulmonary vascular resistance is initially normal (isolated post-capillary PH). Depending on the extent and chronicity of left atrial pressure elevation additional pulmonary vascular remodeling may occur (combined pre- and post-capillary PH). Mechanical interventions for the correction of valve disease often but not always reduce pulmonary pressures. However, the reduction in pulmonary pressures is often modest, and persistent PH in these patients is common and a marker of poor prognosis. In the present review we discuss the pathophysiology and clinical impact of PH in patients with aortic and mitral valve disease, the comprehensive non-invasive and invasive diagnostic approach required to define treatment of PH, and recent insights from mechanistic studies, registries and randomized studies, and we provide an outlook regarding gaps in evidence, future clinical challenges, and research opportunities in this setting.",

An inflammatory state might be one mechanism linking PTSS with poor prognosis after ACS. We tested the hypothesis that a change in C-reactive protein (CRP) between hospital admission and 3-month follow-up is an independent predictor of ACS-triggered PTSS.\r\nMETHODS: We assessed 183 patients (median age 59\u202fyears; 84% men) with verified myocardial infarction (MI) within 48\u202fh of an acute coronary intervention and three months post-MI for self-rated PTSS. 14 (7.7%) patients fulfilled definition criteria for PTSS caseness. CRP values were categorized according to the predicted risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at hospital admission (acute inflammatory response): 0 to <5\u202fmg/L, 5 to <10\u202fmg/L, 10 to <20\u202fmg/L, and\u202f\u2265\u202f20 mg/L; and at 3-month follow-up (low-grade inflammation): 0 to <1\u202fmg/L, 1 to <3\u202fmg/L, and\u202f\u2265\u202f3\u202fmg/L. Additionally, in a subsample of 84 patients with CRP levels below 20 mg/L at admission, CRP values were log-transformed.\r\nRESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, less of a reduction or an increase of log CRP values between admission and 3-month follow-up predicted PTSS caseness (OR 6.25, 95% CI 1.25, 31.38), and continuous PTSS (unstandardized B\u202f=\u202f0.21, 95% CI 0.07, 4.19; p\u202f=\u202f0.043). Less reduction in CRP risk categories predicted both PTSS caseness (OR 4.14, 95% CI 1.89, 9.06) and continuous PTSS (B\u202f=\u202f1.80, 95% CI 1.09, 2.51; p\u202f<\u202f0.001).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Persistently heightened inflammation seems to be predictive for the development of PTSS three months after ACS, so interventions to lower inflammation might be warranted.",

These benefits, however, must be weighed against the increased risk of transplant-related mortality. Further, with disease progression, severe extensive internal organ involvement and damage ensues, constituting an exclusion criterion for safety reasons, leaving a limited window whereby patients with SSc are eligible for HSCT. Although autologous HSCT offers the possibility of drug-free remission, relapse can occur, requiring re-initiation of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. HSCT is also associated with secondary autoimmune diseases and gonadal failure.

We aimed at assessing whether the direct transfer method can be used for dermatophytes and whether an own mass spectra library would be superior to the Bruker library. We used the Bruker Biotyper to build a dermatophyte mass spectra library and assessed its performance by 1/testing a panel of mass spectrum produced with strains genotypically identified and, 2/comparing MALDI-TOF/MS identification to morphology-based methods. Identification of dermatophytes using the Bruker library is poor. Our library provided 97% concordance between ITS sequencing and MALDI-TOF/MS analysis with a panel of 1104 spectra corresponding to 276 strains. Direct transfer method using unpolished target plates allowed proper identification of 85% of dermatophytes clinical isolates most of which were common dermatophytes. A homemade dermatophyte MSP library is a prerequisite for accurate identification of species absent in the Bruker library but it also improves identification of species already listed in the database.

Diagnostic methods and treatment options have improved over recent years, due to threedimensional image processing and the use of patient-specific implants. Nonetheless, the indications for orbital reconstructive surgery are still controversial. Previous authors have reported a linear correlation between post-traumatic increases in orbital volume and enophthalmos and diplopia. Post-traumatic increases in orbital volume are often considered to be predictive of long-term symptoms; therefore, it is commonly recommended that orbital volume increases be treated as an indication for early reconstructive surgery. However, the results of this study did not show any statistically significant long-term linear correlation between increased orbital volume and enophthalmos or diplopia, and the performance of orbital volume as a predictor of ocular symptoms was poor. Hence, we do not consider increased post-traumatic orbital volume to be particularly useful for predicting late enophthalmos or diplopia. However, a statistical correlation between fractures of the anterior and medial thirds of the orbital floor and double vision was found. As such, fractures of the middle and anterior third should be regarded as problematic, and surgical reconstruction should be considered in these cases.",

We repaired the lacerated flexor digitorum profundus tendons with core suture repairs using the 6-strand M-Tang method and without circumferential sutures. We divided the pulleys as much as needed to allow excursion of the repaired tendons, including complete division of the A4 or A2 pulleys when necessary. In nine fingers, we repaired one slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon and resected the other half. When the flexor digitorum profundus tendon would not glide under the A2 pulley, we excised the remaining slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon. The wrist was splinted in mild extension post-surgery with early commencement of tenodesis exercises. No tendon repair ruptured. By the Strickland criteria, out of 27 fingers, 18 had excellent, six had good, two had fair, and one had poor results. We conclude that a strong core suture (such as the M-Tang repair) without peripheral sutures, and with division of pulleys as necessary is safe for early active motion and yields good outcomes.",

        "document": "Title: Predicting responsiveness to fampridine in gait-impaired patients with multiple sclerosis\nAbstract: BACKGROUND  Fampridine leads to significant walking improvements in many persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, a relevant proportion of PwMS does not respond to fampridine and predictors of initial drug responsiveness are unknown.  METHODS  Drug response to prolonged-release (PR)-fampridine was assessed in 55 PwMS using the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the 12-item multiple sclerosis walking scale (MSWS-12) as outcome parameters. Patients were treated with PR-fampridine and placebo each for 6 weeks in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with cross-over design (NCT01576354). Possible predictors of drug responsiveness were investigated by multiple correlation analysis and binary logistic regression models. An additional longitudinal analysis followed drug responses of 32 patients treated with PR-fampridine over 3 years to identify potential predictors of long-term drug responsiveness.  RESULTS  Severity of walking disability was positively correlated with enhanced responses to PR-fampridine. The strongest single predictor of drug responsiveness was poor 6MWT performance at baseline, which was positively correlated with enhanced drug response in the 6MWT (R=-0.541; P<0.001). A multivariable logistic regression model including 6MWT and T25FW baseline performances predicted PR-fampridine responder status with an accuracy of 85.5% (specificity: 90.0%; sensitivity: 73.3%), with a threshold of 211m in the 6MWT best separating responders from non-responders. Enhanced drug responsiveness after 3 years correlated with decline in walking endurance during this period (R=-0.634; P=0.001).  CONCLUSIONS  Initial walking impairment is a good predictor of therapeutic responsiveness to PR-fampridine. Valid predictors of patients' responsiveness to PR-fampridine are essential for patient stratification and optimisation of MS treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "document": "Title: How can inequalities in mortality be reduced? A quantitative analysis of 6 risk factors in 21 European populations\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\r\nSocioeconomic inequalities in mortality are one of the greatest challenges for health policy in all European countries, but the potential for reducing these inequalities is unclear. We therefore quantified the impact of equalizing the distribution of six risk factors for mortality: smoking, overweight, lack of physical exercise, lack of social participation, low income, and economic inactivity.\r\nMETHODS\r\nWe collected and harmonized data on mortality and risk factors by educational level for 21 European populations in the early 2000s. The impact of the risk factors on mortality in each educational group was determined using Population Attributable Fractions. We estimated the impact on inequalities in mortality of two scenarios: a theoretical upward levelling scenario in which inequalities in the risk factor were completely eliminated, and a more realistic best practice scenario, in which inequalities in the risk factor were reduced to those seen in the country with the smallest inequalities for that risk factor.\r\nFINDINGS\r\nIn general, upward levelling of inequalities in smoking, low income and economic inactivity hold the greatest potential for reducing inequalities in mortality. While the importance of low income is similar across Europe, smoking is more important in the North and East, and overweight in the South. On the basis of best practice scenarios the potential for reducing inequalities in mortality is often smaller, but still substantial in many countries for smoking and physical inactivity.\r\nINTERPRETATION\r\nTheoretically, there is a great potential for reducing inequalities in mortality in most European countries, for example by equity-oriented tobacco control policies, income redistribution and employment policies. Although it is necessary to achieve substantial degrees of upward levelling to make a notable difference for inequalities in mortality, the existence of best practice countries with more favourable distributions for some of these risk factors suggests that this is feasible.",

METHODS  Patients with FAIS underwent 12 weeks of semi-standardized and progressive exercise therapy. Good therapy outcome (responders) vs. poor therapy outcome (non-responders) was determined at week 18 with the Global Treatment Outcome for hip pain. Hip function was evaluated using the Hip Outcome Score (HOS) activities of daily living (ADL) and Sport at baseline, week 6, 12 and 18. Hip muscle strength and dynamic pelvic control were evaluated using dynamometry and video analysis, respectively, at baseline, week 12 and 18. Hip morphology was evaluated with imaging at baseline.  RESULTS  Thirty-one patients (mean age: 24 years) were included. Sixteen (52%) patients were responsive and 15 (48%) were not responsive to exercise therapy. Only responders improved HOS ADL and HOS Sport by 10 (95% CI: 7 to 14, P<0.001) and 20 points (95%CI: 15 to 25, P<0.001), respectively, and hip abductor strength by 0.27 Nm/kg (95%CI: 0.18 to 0.36, P<0.001). The prevalence of patients showing good dynamic pelvic control only increased in responders (44%, P=0.029). The prevalence of severe cam morphology was higher in non-responders than responders (40% vs. 6%, P=0.037).  CONCLUSION  Half of patients with FAIS benefits from exercise therapy at short term. Responsiveness to hip abductor strength and dynamic pelvic control improvements is associated with good therapy outcome, whereas presence of severe cam morphology is associated with poor therapy outcome.

CCD and cerebellar asymmetry index were determined from PET and compared to BOLD-CVR quantitative values. Neurologic status at admission and outcome after 3 months were determined with NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores.\r\nRESULTS\r\nFor both the BOLD-CVR and PET examination, a significant cerebellar asymmetry index was found for participants exhibiting CCD (CCD+ vs CCD-: for BOLD-CVR 13.11 \u00b1 9.46 vs 1.52 \u00b1 4.97,  < 0.001; and for PET 7.31 \u00b1 2.75 vs 1.68 \u00b1 2.98,  < 0.001). The area under the curve for BOLD-CVR was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.75-1.0) with 0.91 sensitivity and 0.81 specificity to detect CCD. Participants exhibiting CCD were in poorer clinical condition at baseline (CCD+ vs CCD-: NIHSS 7 vs 1,  = 0.003; mRS 3 vs 1,  = 0.001) and after 3-month follow-up (NIHSS 2 vs 0,  = 0.02; mRS 1 vs 0,  = 0.04). Worse performance on both scores showed an agreement with a larger BOLD-CVR cerebellar asymmetry index. This was not found for PET.\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nBOLD-CVR demonstrates similar sensitivity to detect CCD as compared to (O)-HO-PET in patients with symptomatic unilateral cerebrovascular steno-occlusive disease. Furthermore, participants exhibiting CCD had a poorer baseline neurologic performance and neurologic outcome at 3 months.\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE\r\nThis study provides Class II evidence that BOLD-CVR identifies CCD in patients with symptomatic unilateral cerebrovascular steno-occlusive disease.",

Patients and methods: Eighty-six pediatric medulloblastoma patients treated in Switzerland between 1972-1991 were retrospectively studied regarding the influence of M-stage on prognosis. 39 were M0, 13 M1, 15 Mx, 17 M2, and 2 M3. Results: Five- and 10-year overall survival rates were 76% and 54% for M0, 68% and 50% for Mx, 36% and 25% for M1, and 22% and 22% for M2-3 (P < 0.001), respectively. No significant survival differences were observed between M1 and M2-3 patients. Among 26 patients with only postoperative CSF cytologies, seven were positive. Their outcome was similar to that of six preoperatively staged M1 and significantly different from that of M0 patients (P = 0.001). In 14 patients both pre- and postoperative CSF cytology was performed. Total agreement was observed between the pre- and postoperative results (six positive and eight negative). Among the 19 M2-3 patients CSF cytology was positive in eight, negative in five, and unknown in six. Conclusions: A positive CSF cytology either pre- or post-operatively predicts for a poor outcome, similar to that observed in stage M2-3 patients. A postoperative cytology is likely to be concordant with cytologic results obtained preoperatively, and seems to have the same prognostic significance. A negative cytology, however, does not exclude a more advanced stage",

        "document": "Title: Left ventricular systolic function in aortic stenosis\nAbstract: In aortic valve stenosis, concentric hypertrophy develops which is characterized by a reduced end-diastolic radius-to-wall thickness ratio (r/h) with an essentially normal cavity shape. As long as the product of (r/h) and LV systolic pressure remains constant, hypertrophy is appropriate. An increase in the product, which represents an increase in wall stress signals inadequate LV hypertrophy. Although at first glance, massive LV hypertrophy appears favourable for the maintenance of a normal LV ejection fraction in aortic stenosis, data from 23 studies of the literature have shown an inverse relationship between ejection fraction and LV angiographic mass m\u22122 (r=\u22120\u00b759). Both a degree of hypertrophy inadequate to keep systolic wall stress within normal limits and a reduction of LV contractility may explain the depression of ejection fraction when LV angiographic mass is sizeably increased. Conversely, a normal ejection fraction in aortic stenosis may not be indicative of normal systolic myocardial function under all circumstances. In the presence of mildly reduced contractility, a normal ejection fraction may be maintained by the use of preload reserve. Assessment of myocardial structure from LV endomyocardial biopsies revealed no differences in muscle fibre diameter, interstitial fibrosis and volume fraction of myofibrils between patients with aortic stenosis having a normal and those with a depressed ejection fraction. Preoperative ejection fraction is a poor predictor of postoperative survival, whereas markedly increased preoperative angiographic mass and end-systolic volume have been reported to predict an unsatisfactory postoperative outcome characterized by either death or poor LV function",

However, there is no consensus on the answer to the underlying question about what this standard should be, despite the fact that it is crucial for the design of saving incentives and pension systems. We address this question with a randomized survey design, individually tailored to each respondent's financial situation, and conducted both in the U.S. and The Netherlands. We find that adequate levels of retirement spending exceed 80% of working life spending for a majority of respondents. Minimum acceptable income replacement rates range from 95 to 45% across income quintiles in the U.S., and from 75 to 60% across income quintiles in The Netherlands. The smaller range in The Netherlands may in part reflect the much tighter income distribution there",

Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I deficiency (Mc Kusick 23391) and 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase deficiency (Mc Kusick 26164) lead to impaired BH4 biosynthesis, dihydropteridine reductase deficiency (DHPR; Mc Kusick 26263) prevents BH4 from being regenerated after oxidation in the coupled reaction with hydroxylases. All these traits are inherited recessively. Patients develop, in addition to hyperphenylalaninemia, severe neurological symptoms due to biogenic amine deficiency, and they are not responsive to a phenylalanine restricted diet. Since the prognosis may be poor even if patients were treated early with diet and substitutive therapy, prenatal diagnosis was recently made possible following different procedures. Problems inherent in prenatal diagnosis of a twin pregnancy at risk for DHPR deficiency are presented.",

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of the best mid-term outcome in OHT after FF. METHODS Twenty-year multi-institutional retrospective analysis on OHT for FF. RESULTS Between 1991 and 2011, 61 patients, mean age 15.0 \u00b1 9.7 years, underwent OHT for failing atriopulmonary connection (17 patients = 27.8%) or total cavopulmonary connection (44 patients = 72.2%). Modality of FF included arrhythmia (14.8%), complex obstructions in the Fontan circuit (16.4%), protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) (22.9%), impaired ventricular function (31.1%) or a combination of the above (14.8%). The mean time interval between Fontan completion and OHT was 10.7 \u00b1 6.6 years. Early FF occurred in 18%, requiring OHT 0.8 \u00b1 0.5 years after Fontan. The hospital mortality rate was 18.3%, mainly secondary to infection (36.4%) and graft failure (27.3%). The mean follow-up was 66.8 \u00b1 54.2 months. The overall Kaplan-Meier survival estimate was 81.9 \u00b1 1.8% at 1 year, 73 \u00b1 2.7% at 5 years and 56.8 \u00b1 4.3% at 10 years. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival estimate was 82.3 \u00b1 5.9% in late FF and 32.7 \u00b1 15.0% in early FF (P = 0.0007). Late FF with poor ventricular function exhibited a 91.5 \u00b1 5.8% 5-year OHT survival. PLE was cured in 77.7% of hospital survivors, but the 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimate in PLE was 46.3 \u00b1 14.4 vs 84.3 \u00b1 5.5% in non-PLE (P = 0.0147). Cox proportional hazards identified early FF (P = 0.0005), complex Fontan pathway obstruction (P = 0.0043) and PLE (P = 0.0033) as independent predictors of 5-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS OHT is an excellent surgical option for late FF with impaired ventricular function. Protein dispersion improves with OHT, but PLE negatively affects the mid-term OHT outcome, mainly for early infective complications",

Conventional treatment consists medical treatment or cardiac transplantation. However, despite severely decreased left ventricular function, mitral annuloplasty may improve survival and reduce the need for allografts. Methods: From January 1996 to July 2002, 121 patients with severe end-stage dilated (DCM) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), mitral regurgitation \u22652, and left ventricular ejection fraction \u226430% underwent mitral valve annuloplasty using a flexible posterior ring. DCM was diagnosed in 30 patients (25%), whereas ICM was found in 91 patients (75%). Concomitant tricuspid valve repair was performed in 14 (46.6%) patients in the DCM, and in 11 (12%) in the ICM group (P=0.0001), coronary artery bypass grafting in three (10%) in the DCM, and in 78 patients (86%) in the ICM group (P<0.00001). The mean follow-up time was 567\u00b174 days in the DCM and 793\u00b163 days in the ICM group (ns). Results: Early mortality was 6.6% (8/121), and was equal for both groups. Improvement in NYHA class (DCM 3.3+0.1-1.8\u00b10.16; ICM from 3.2+0.04 to 1.7\u00b10.07) were equal between groups after 1 year. Seventeen (15%) late deaths occurred during the follow-up period. There was no difference in the 2-year actuarial survival between groups (DCM/ICM 0.93/0.85). Risk factors for mitral reconstruction failure, defined as regurgitation \u22652 after 1 year, were preoperative NYHA IV in the DCM group (P=0.03), a preoperative posterior infarction (P=0.025), decreased left ventricular function (P=0.043), larger ring size (P=0.026) and preoperative renal failure (P=0.05) in the ICM group. Risk factors for death were larger ring size (P=0.02) and an increased LVEDD (P=0.027) in the DCM group and the postoperative use of IABP (P=0.002), renal failure (P=0.001), and a larger preoperative LVESD (P=0.035) in the ICM group. Conclusion: Mitral reconstruction with a posterior annuloplasty using a flexible ring is effective in patients with severely depressed left ventricle function and has an acceptable operative mortality. Mid-term results are superior to medical treatment alone and comparable to cardiac transplantation",

An inflatable upper arm cuff enables intermittent oscillometric calibration. CNAP was compared with invasive radial artery pressure recordings from the opposite wrist in 22 high-risk surgical patients with an inter-arm oscillometric mean arterial pressure difference < or = 10 mm Hg. Oscillometric, tonometric and invasive digital pressure values, and invasive and CNAP waveforms were obtained by the same instrument (Colin BP-508). Correlation coefficients (r) of invasive vs oscillometric values (n = 481 pairs) were 0.83, 0.90 and 0.92, and mean absolute errors of oscillometry were 7.6, 4.7, and 2.6 mm Hg for systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures, respectively. Correlation was poor for systolic (r = 0.80), diastolic (r = 0.77) and mean (r = 0.84) invasive vs CNAP values (n = 1375). Compared with oscillometry, mean absolute errors of 15.2, 10.9 and 9.4 mm Hg for systolic, diastolic and mean CNAP, respectively, were significantly (P < 0.001) higher. Mean prediction errors of CNAP, compared with invasive values, were -5.8 (SD 14.2) mm Hg for systolic, +7.2 (8.3) mm Hg for diastolic and +3.9 (8.8) mm Hg for mean arterial pressure. Individual patient accuracy of CNAP was assessed as good (individual prediction error < or = 5 (8) mm Hg and individual absolute error < or = 10 mm Hg) in seven patients, as acceptable (< or = 10 (12) and < or = 15 mm Hg) in 11 patients, and as inadequate in four of 22 patients. Individual accuracy of oscillometry was good or acceptable in all 22 patients. The trend in CNAP changes (difference between consecutive measurements) was sufficiently accurate during induction of anaesthesia, as only 47 (7.6%), 14 (2.3%) and 27 (4.4%) of 616 systolic, diastolic and mean CNAP values differed by more than 10 mm Hg of invasive pressure trends. We conclude that: intermittent oscillometry provides accurate arterial pressure monitoring; CNAP measurements offer a reliable trend indicator of pressure changes during induction of anaesthesia and may be considered an alternative to invasive pressure measurements, should arterial cannulation be difficult in an awake patient; and accuracy of absolute CNAP values is only moderate and unpredictable, thus radial artery tonometry should not replace invasive monitoring in high-risk patients during major surgical procedures",

To study the differences in activation of biochemical pathways, we performed mRNA and protein expression analyses of primary glioblastoma tissues from 11 long-term survivors (LTS; overall survival \u2265 36 months) and 12 short-term survivors (STS; overall survival \u2264 6 months). The mRNA expression ratio of the retinoic acid transporters fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2 (CRABP2), which regulate the differential delivery of retinoic acid to either antioncogenic retinoic acid receptors or prooncogenic nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta, was statistically significantly higher in the tumor tissues of STS than those of LTS (median ratio in STS tumors = 3.64, 10th-90th percentile = 1.43-4.54 vs median ratio in LTS tumors = 1.42, 10th-90th percentile = \u22120.98 to 2.59; P < .001). High FABP5 protein expression in STS tumors was associated with highly proliferating tumor cells and activation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog. The data suggest that retinoic acid signaling activates different targets in glioblastomas from LTS and STS. All statistical tests were two-sided",

        "document": "Title: Rheumatoid arthritis - clinical aspects: 134. Predictors of joint damage in South Africans with rheumatoid arthritis\nAbstract: Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes progressive joint damage and functional disability. Studies on factors affecting joint damage as clinical outcome are lacking in Africa. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of joint damage in adult South Africans with established RA. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 100 black patients with RA of >5 years were assessed for joint damage using a validated clinical method, the RA articular damage (RAAD) score. Potential predictors of joint damage that were documented included socio-demographics, smoking, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, delay in disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) initiation, global disease activity as measured by the disease activity score (DAS28), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), and autoantibody status. The predictive value of variables was assessed by univariate and stepwise multivariate regression analyses. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: The mean (SD) age was 56 (9.8) years, disease duration 17.5 (8.5) years, educational level 7.5 (3.5) years and DMARD lag was 9 (8.8) years. Female to male ratio was 10:1. The mean (SD) DAS28 was 4.9 (1.5) and total RAAD score was 28.3 (12.8). The mean (SD) BMI was 27.2\u2009kg/m2 (6.2) and 93% of patients were rheumatoid factor (RF) positive. More than 90% of patients received between 2 to 3 DMARDs. Significant univariate predictors of a poor RAAD score were increasing age (p\u2009=\u20090.001), lower education level (p\u2009=\u20090.019), longer disease duration (p\u2009<\u20090.001), longer DMARD lag (p\u2009=\u20090.014), lower BMI (p\u2009=\u20090.025), high RF titre (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and high ESR (p\u2009=\u20090.008). The multivariate regression analysis showed that the only independent significant predictors of a higher mean RAAD score were older age at disease onset (p\u2009=\u20090.04), disease duration (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and RF titre (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was also a negative association between BMI and the mean total RAAD score (p\u2009=\u20090.049). Conclusions: Patients with longstanding established RA have more severe irreversible joint damage as measured by the clinical RAAD score, contrary to other studies in Africa. This is largely reflected by a delay in the initiation of early effective treatment. Independent of disease duration, older age at disease onset and a higher RF titre are strongly associated with more joint damage. The inverse association between BMI and articular damage in RA has been observed in several studies using radiographic damage scores. The mechanisms underlying this paradoxical association are still widely unknown but adipokines have recently been suggested to play a role.

Neonatal complications and the long-term follow-up of fetuses with ROH in two pediatric centres are described. Method. 23 fetuses (16 males, 7 females) were included as patients. Primary diseases included congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (n = 16), autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (n = 4) and renal tubular dysgenesis (n = 3). The analysis includes retrospective chart review. Results. Seven children died (30%), the majority (n = 4, 17%) within the neonatal period due to pulmonary hypoplasia and renal insufficiency. Fourteen patients (61%) required postnatal mechanical ventilation for a median of 4 (range 1-60) days; 11 infants had an associated pneumothorax. All 16 surviving children have chronic kidney disease (CKD) at a current median age of 5.7 years (range 0.5-14.5), managed conservatively in eight patients [median glomerular filtration rate 51 (range 20-78) ml/min/1.73\u2009m2]. Eight patients reached end-stage renal disease at a median age of 0.3 years (range 2 days to 8.3 years), including one patient with pre-emptive kidney transplantation. Five of the patients requiring dialysis underwent successful renal transplantation at a median age of 3.5 years (range 2.5-4). Growth was impaired in seven children requiring growth hormone treatment. Cognitive and motor development was normal in 12 (75%) of the 16 patients and showed a delay in four children, including two with associated syndromal features. Conclusion. ROH is not always associated with a poor prognosis and long-term outcome in survivors is encouraging. The high incidence of neonatal complications and long-term morbidity due to CKD requires a multidisciplinary management of these children",

Patients and methods Forty-five consecutive patients were analyzed retrospectively. We devised an index of pretreatment intensity (IPTI) based number of different chemo- and radio-therapy regimens given between diagnosis and HDC and on the duration of disease. Results With a median follow-up of 47 months the post-transplant event-free survival (EFS) was 44% and the overall survival. (OAS) was 62% at four years. The IPTI allowed to discriminate between a low and a high-risk group with a four-year post-transplant EFS of 66% and 11% and a OAS of 87% and 28%, respectively (P = 0.0001). Of the 39 patients with sufficient follow-up after HDC, post-transplant EFS lasted on average \u2265 18.5 months longer than the pretransplant treatment-free remission. Conclusions HDC with the CBV regimen confers significant benefit to patients with chemosensitive relapsed Hodgkin's disease. The IPTI may help to select patients with a good response to HDC and to identify poor prognosis patients suitable for experimental protocols or palliative care only",

Methods and Results Four hundred and eleven consecutive patients with heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV (mean population age 75 years, 56% males) were enrolled in 71 primary care offices throughout Switzerland. During a mean follow-up period of 1\u00b74 years, 68 patients had died. One-year total mortality was 12\u00b76% compared to 4\u00b73% in the underlying Swiss population (standardized mortality ratio 3\u00b70). Among patients with heart failure NYHA II, III and IV, mortality was 7\u00b71%, 15\u00b70% and 28\u00b70%, respectively. In multivariate Cox regression, statistically significant (P<0\u00b705) predictors of mortality were NYHA class (NYHA III: risk ratio [RR]=1\u00b76; NYHA IV: RR=2\u00b72), recent hospital stay for heart disease (RR=2\u00b73), creatinine>120\u03bcmol.l\u22121 (RR=1\u00b78) systolic blood pressure<100mmHg (RR=2\u00b74), heart rate>100min\u22121 (RR=2\u00b77), age (per 10 years, RR=1\u00b76) and female gender (RR=0\u00b749). Among patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, 1-year mortality was 14\u00b73%, and predictors were similar except that female gender was no longer associated with reduced mortality. Primary care physicians significantly overestimated 1-year mortality (estimated mortality 25\u00b79% vs observed mortality 12\u00b76%,P =0\u00b7001). Conclusions Unselected outpatients with heart failure have a poor prognosis, particularly those with advanced heart failure and a recent hospital stay for heart disease.

This study investigates the relationship between work status and objective as well as subjective quality of life (QoL) in people with SMI. Methods: : The sample consists of 261 subjects (102 women, 159 men) aged 35 (men) and 38 (women) years on average, of whom 158 suffer from a schizophrenic disorder (ICD-10: F2) and 103 were diagnosed as having an affective disorder (ICD-10: F3). Subjective QoL was assessed with the WHOQOL-BREF scale. Results: : Subjects with an occupation in general have a larger social network at their disposal and receive more social support. With regard to income, few (12%) of the subjects with a job on the open labour market live below the poverty level, but many (28-38%) of those engaged in sheltered or other work-like activities do. Occupation ameliorates satisfaction with life domains referring to social integration (social relationships, environment), whereas the individual's well-being (psychological, physical) is hardly affected. Social support is an important mediator of the relationship between occupation and subjective QoL. Income is weakly and negatively related to subjective QoL. Conclusion: : Supportive relationships to colleagues at the workplace mainly explain the better subjective QoL of SMI people with an occupation.When designing specific employment possibilities for people with SMI, we should take notice of the social support dimension at the workplace. Mentally ill people have a substantial poverty risk, even when they are working. In particular, payment for sheltered work should be ameliorated",

However, the literature reveals few unequivocal predictors and they often explain a relatively low proportion of variance in outcome. This suggests that we have a long way to go before being able to rest easily, having refused someone surgery on the basis of unfavourable baseline characteristics. The best recommendation is to ensure, firstly, that the indication for surgery is absolutely clear-cut (i.e. that surgically remediable pathology exists) and then to consider the various factors that may influence the \"typical\u201d outcome. Consistent risk factors for a poor outcome regarding return-to-work include long-term sick leave/receipt of disability benefit. Hence, every effort should be made to keep the individual in the workforce, despite the ongoing symptoms and plans for surgery. In patients with a particularly heavy job, consultation with occupational physicians might later ease the patient's way back into the workplace. Patients with degenerative disorders and/or comorbidity should be counselled that few of them will have complete/lasting pain relief or a complete return to pre-morbid function. Patients with a high level of distress may benefit from psychological treatment, before and/or accompanying the surgical treatment. The opportunity (time), encouragement (education and positive messages), and resources (referral to appropriate support services) to modify risk factors that are indeed modifiable should be offered, and realistic expectations should be discussed with the patient before the decision to operate is made",

Recent data described preoperative thrombocytosis in malignancies to be associated with poor prognosis. Methods: A retrospective analysis from a prospective database (1997-2006) was performed for 291 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who underwent transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy and extended lymphadenectomy. Squamous cell cancer was found in 47.0% and adenocarcinoma in 50.9% (2.1% had rare histologies). Neoadjuvant chemoradiation was performed in 152 (52%) patients. Platelet counts before surgery and on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 10, and 30 were evaluated. We used the published cutoff value of 293\u00d7109/l (mean of 80 healthy controls\u00b1standard deviation) for platelet counts. Results: High platelet counts before surgery missed significance for poorer survival (p=0.054). Following a perioperative fall in thrombocytes, a significant rise at POD 10 after surgery was evident. Platelet counts of more than 293\u00d7109/l at this time correlated with a significantly improved survival rate (p=0.027). Patients with no increase in thrombocytes until POD 10 had significantly poorer survival (p=0.012). Multivariate analysis confirmed that a thrombocyte increase between the preoperative count and that on POD 10 is an independent prognostic indicator (p=0.035) for patients with completely (R0) resected tumors. Conclusions: An increase in platelet counts measured on POD 10 following transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy and extended lymphadenectomy is an independent prognostic indicator for improved survival in patients with esophageal cancer",

        "document": "Title: Hindsight judgement on ambiguous episodes of suspected infection in critically ill children: poor consensus amongst experts?\nAbstract: Few episodes of suspected infection observed in paediatric intensive care are classifiable without ambiguity by a priori defined criteria. Most require additional expert judgement. Recently, we observed a high variability in antibiotic prescription rates, not explained by the patients' clinical data or underlying diseases. We hypothesised that the disagreement of experts in adjudication of episodes of suspected infection could be one of the potential causes for this variability. During a 5-month period, we included all patients of a 19-bed multidisciplinary, tertiary, neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit, in whom infection was clinically suspected and antibiotics were prescribed (n=183). Three experts (two senior ICU physicians and a specialist in infectious diseases) were provided with all patient data, laboratory and microbiological findings. All experts classified episodes according to a priori defined criteria into: proven sepsis, probable sepsis (negative cultures), localised infection and no infection. Episodes of proven viral infection and incomplete data sets were excluded. Of the remaining 167 episodes, 48 were classifiable by a priori criteria (n=28 proven sepsis, n= 20 no infection). The three experts only achieved limited agreement beyond chance in the remaining 119 episodes (kappa = 0.32, and kappa = 0.19 amongst the ICU physicians). The kappa is a measure of the degree of agreement beyond what would be expected by chance alone, with 0 indicating the chance result and 1 indicating perfect agreement. Conclusion: agreement of specialists in hindsight adjudication of episodes of suspected infection is of questionable reliability",

Some implicitly assume utility is defined on final wealth whereas others argue it may be defined on initial wealth and income separately. I argue that making income and wealth separate arguments of utility has important implications that may not be widely recognized. A framework is presented that allows the unified treatment of expected utility models and anomalies. I show that expected utility of income models can predict framing induced preference reversals, a willingness to pay-willingness to accept gap for lotteries, and choice-value preference reversals. The main contribution is a theorem. It is proved that for all utility functions where initial wealth and income enter separately, either there will be preference reversals or preferences can be represented by a utility function defined on final wealth alone",

Medical variables were retrieved from the patients' hospital records. Patients reported worse physical HRQoL than controls but similar mental HRQoL and PA. Female CHD patients showed worse physical and mental HRQoL and poorer PA than males. In CHD patients, a lower educational level and lower physical exercise capacity predicted lower physical HRQoL, but complexity of CHD was not related to HRQoL or PA. Less social support was associated with lower mental HRQoL and poorer PA in CHD patients.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Young adults with CHD have impaired physical HRQoL but normal mental HRQoL and PA. Lower physical exercise capacity, female sex, less social support and lower educational level predict an unfavorable quality of life and PA. This subgroup of patients should be monitored more closely and provided with special psychosocial care to improve long-term outcome.",

In this paper, I argue that much of this criticism misses the point: it assumes that economics is about explaining human behavior when in fact, since Adam Smith, economists have been more interested in explaining patterns that emerge from social interaction. While some minimal account of human behavior is needed for explaining such phenomena, a full-fledged psychological or neurobiological theory of individual behavior might not be. The more pressing yet under-researched challenge for economic models is to arrive at an adequate description of social interaction processes that connect individual choices on the micro-level and robust patterns on the macro-level",

This study examines the validity and clinical utility of the ICD-11PGD guideline by testing its performance in a well-characterized clinical sample and contrasting it with a very different criteria set with the same name (PGDPLOS).\r\n\r\nMETHODS: We examined data from 261 treatment-seeking participants in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-sponsored multicenter clinical trial to determine the rates of diagnosis using the ICD-11PGD guideline and compared these with diagnosis using PGDPLOS criteria.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: The ICD-11PGD guideline identified 95.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 93.3-98.2%] of a treatment-responsive cohort of patients with distressing and impairing grief. PGDPLOS criteria identified only 59.0% (95% CI 53.0-65.0%) and were more likely to omit those who lost someone other than a spouse, were currently married, bereaved by violent means, or not diagnosed with co-occurring depression. Those not diagnosed by PGDPLOS criteria showed the same rate of treatment response as those who were diagnosed.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The ICD-11PGD diagnostic guideline showed good performance characteristics in this sample, while PGDPLOS criteria did not. Limitations of the research sample used to derive PGDPLOS criteria may partly explain their poor performance in a more diverse clinical sample.

Although therapeutic hypothermia (cooling) has been shown to be an effective therapy for neonatal HIE, many cooled infants have poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. In animal models of neonatal encephalopathy, inhaled xenon combined with cooling has been shown to offer better neuroprotection than cooling alone.  OBJECTIVES  To determine the effects of xenon as an adjuvant to therapeutic hypothermia on mortality and neurodevelopmental morbidity, and to ascertain clinically important side effects of xenon plus therapeutic hypothermia in newborn infants with HIE. To assess early predictors of adverse outcomes and potential side effects of xenon.  SEARCH METHODS  We used the standard strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE (from 1966), Embase (from 1966), and PubMed (from 1966) for randomised controlled and quasi-randomised trials. We also searched conference proceedings and the reference lists of cited articles. We conducted our most recent search in August 2017.  SELECTION CRITERIA  We included all trials allocating term or late preterm encephalopathic newborns to cooling plus xenon or cooling alone, irrespective of timing (starting age and duration) and concentrations used for xenon administration.  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS  Two review authors independently assessed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed meta-analyses using risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs), and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data.  MAIN RESULTS  A single randomised controlled trial enrolling 92 participants was eligible for this review. Researchers have not reported long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, including the primary outcome of this review - death or long-term major neurodevelopmental disability in infancy (18 months to three years of age). Cooling plus xenon was not associated with reduced mortality at latest follow-up, based upon low quality evidence. Investigators noted no substantial differences between groups for other secondary outcomes of this review, such as biomarkers of brain damage assessed with magnetic resonance imaging and occurrence of seizures during primary hospitalisation. Available data do not show an increased adverse event rate in the cooling plus xenon group compared with the cooling alone group.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS  Current evidence from one small randomised controlled pilot trial is inadequate to show whether cooling plus xenon is safe or effective in near-term and term newborns with HIE. Further trials reporting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes are needed.",

        "document": "Title: Non-medical prescription opioid users exhibit dysfunctional physiological stress responses to social rejection\nAbstract: Non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) recently increased dramatically, especially in the U.S. Although chronic opioid use is commonly accompanied by deficits in social functioning and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenergic (HPA) stress axis, little is known about the impact of NMPOU on psychosocial stress responses. Therefore, we measured physiological responses of the autonomic nervous system and the HPA axis to social rejection using the Cyberball paradigm. We compared 23 individuals with NMPOU, objectively confirmed by hair and urine analyses, with 29 opioid-na\u00efve, healthy controls. As expected, heart rate variability (HRV), an index of parasympathetic activity, increased significantly during exclusion within controls, while in the NMPOU group only a trend in the same direction was found. However, increased HRV was robustly moderated by opioid craving indicating worse emotion regulation to social exclusion specifically in individuals with high opioid craving. Greater levels of the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol responses to social rejection were found in the NMPOU group indicating hyperreactivity of the HPA axis to social exclusion. Self-ratings suggest that opioid users were aware of rejection, but less emotionally affected by exclusion. Furthermore, controls showed greater negative mood after the Cyberball confirming the task\u2019s validity. Moreover, NMPOU individuals reported a smaller social network size compared to controls. Present findings suggest that chronic NMPOU is associated with dysfunctional physiological responses to psychosocial stressors such as social rejection. In sum, NMPOU was associated with poorer regulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, especially under opioid craving highlighting its potential importance in relapse prevention.",

The most affected populations are the urban poor, settled in informal settlements, vulnerable to increasingly frequent disasters. This severely contributes to the existing housing gap of the affected regions, already struggling with housing demand. The speed of shelter delivery becomes key for an efficient response. The present study aims to understand the impact of material choice on postdisaster shelters delivery through a multiscale analysis of their construction speed. The scales considered for the study are: Constructive technology, Shelter Unit and Post-disaster settlement. At the scale of the Constructive technology, nine different solutions suitable for the Nepal earthquake reconstruction are compared, covering a range from local to industrialized. Successively, twelve different shelter designs delivered worldwide by the International Federation of the Red Cross have been studied under the same lens, at the Shelter unit scale as well as for the case of the Post-disaster camp. The study shows that a clear correlation between material procurement and speed can be identified at the element scale. This correlation becomes secondary at the shelter scale, where it is visible that materials play a limited role in affecting the construction time, that is mainly driven by the complexity of the roof design. Moving to the settlement scale, the procurement choice of materials seems to be impacting the speed again. The study indicates how no univocal solution fits for the three different scales of the study, providing efficient guidelines for post-disaster reconstruction. Beyond that, it highlights that effective construction can be developed with a variety of materials, but its emergency responsiveness can seriously be compromised by a non-appropriate design.",

To overcome these inconsistencies, influencing factors such as social status have to be taken into account in order to explain the relationship between fWHR and aggression. In particular, income has been shown to be an important influencing factor in this relationship. Furthermore, previous findings suggested that testosterone is linked to fWHR and might be associated with fWHR and dominance-related outcomes. Therefore, this study examined the influence of both social status defined by income and salivary testosterone on the association between fWHR and self-reported dominance-related behavioral traits. In particular, links between fWHR and self-report measures of aggression and the Dark Triad (encompassing psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism) were investigated in N = 109 men aged 40 to 75 years. fWHR was significantly associated with physical aggression and two of the Dark Triad traits (psychopathy and Machiavellianism) in men reporting low income. The relationship between fWHR and narcissism was moderated by testosterone. The findings highlight the importance of considering social status and neuroendocrine parameters such as testosterone when examining associations between fWHR and complex psychological traits and behaviors.",

In last years, despite many progresses in managing these patients, it has been shown that clinical remission is reached in less than 50% of patients and a personalised and tailored therapeutic approach is still lacking resulting in a significant gap between guidelines and real-world practice. In this context, the need for biomarkers facilitating early diagnosis and profiling those individuals at the highest risk for a poor outcome has become of crucial interest. A biomarker generally refers to a measured characteristic which may be used as an indicator of some biological state or condition. Three different types of medical biomarkers has been suggested: i. mechanistic markers; ii. clinical disease markers; iii. therapeutic markers. A combination of biomarkers from these different groups could be used for an ideal more accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, although a growing body of evidence is focused on improving biomarkers, a significant amount of this information is not integrated on standard clinical care. The overarching aim of this work was to clarify the meaning of specific biomarkers during autoimmune diseases; their possible role in confirming diagnosis, predicting outcome and suggesting specific treatments.",

Treatment strategies to optimize management will benefit from methods to better identify at-risk patients.  OBJECTIVE  To develop and validate a risk score for convulsive seizure during acute admission for SAH.  METHODS  A risk score was developed in 1500 patients from a single tertiary hospital and externally validated in 852 patients. Candidate predictors were identified by systematic review of the literature and were included in a backward stepwise logistic regression model with in-hospital seizure as a dependent variable. The risk score was assessed for discrimination using the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) and for calibration using a goodness-of-fit test.  RESULTS  The SAFARI score, based on 4 items (age \u2265 60 yr, seizure occurrence before hospitalization, ruptured aneurysm in the anterior circulation, and hydrocephalus requiring cerebrospinal fluid diversion), had AUC = 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73-0.82 in the development cohort. The validation cohort had AUC = 0.65, 95% CI 0.56-0.73. A calibrated increase in the risk of seizure was noted with increasing SAFARI score points.  CONCLUSION  The SAFARI score is a simple tool that adequately stratified SAH patients according to their risk for seizure using a few readily derived predictor items. It may contribute to a more individualized management of seizure following SAH.",

Alternate (*) protocols for Sn indices exist, however the utility of these outcomes in children with mild-to-moderate cystic fibrosis (CF) is unknown.  METHODS  We measured nitrogen MBW and spirometry in 135 children (43 controls) aged 4-18 years. We assessed validity, practicability, and reliability of Sn protocols. Outcomes included the ability to detect abnormal lung function, test agreement, measurement duration, intra-test repeatability, and quality.  RESULTS  Lung clearance index (LCI) was abnormal in 80 (87%), Scond in 55 (60%), Scond* in 17 (19%), Sacin in 10 (11%), Sacin* in 11 (12%), and FEV in 28 (30%). Alternate protocols reduced measurement duration. Agreement of indices to detect abnormal lung function was poor. The quality of analysis and repeatability deteriorated with the alternate technique compared to standard.  CONCLUSION  In children with mild-to-moderate CF lung disease, alternate protocols seem practical but clinimetric properties of standard Sn protocols are preferable.",

There are concerns regarding its sensitivity. Nitrogen-multiple breath washout (N -MBW) is sensitive at detecting early global (lung clearance index [LCI]) and acinar (S ) airway inhomogeneity. We investigated whether N -MBW indices indicate small airways pathology after LTx in children with stable spirometry. Thirty-seven children without bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [BOS] at a median of 1.6 (0.6-3.0) years after LTx underwent N -MBW and spirometry, 28 of those on 2 occasions (\u22646\u00a0months apart) during clinically stable periods. Additional longitudinal data (11 and 8 measurements, respectively) are provided from 2 patients with BOS. In patients without BOS, LCI and S were significantly elevated compared with healthy controls. LCI was abnormal at the 2 test occasions in 81% and 71% of patients, respectively, compared with 30% and 39% of patients with abnormal FEV /forced vital capacity (FVC). Correlations of LCI with FEV /FVC (r\u00a0=\u00a00.1, P\u00a0=\u00a0.4) and FEV (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.1, P\u00a0=\u00a0.6) were poor.

We sought to describe the proportion of individuals initiating ABC and to describe the incidence and factors associated with HSR among those prescribed ABC.  METHODS  We calculated the proportion of EuroSIDA individuals receiving ABC-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) among those receiving cART after 1 January 2009. Poisson regression was used to identify demographic, and current clinical and laboratory factors associated with ABC utilization and discontinuation.  RESULTS  Between 2009 and 2016, of 10 076 individuals receiving cART, 3472 (34%) had ever received ABC-based cART. Temporal trends of ABC utilization were also heterogeneous, with 28% using ABC in 2009, dropping to 26% in 2010 and increasing to 31% in 2016, and varied across regions and over time. Poisson models showed lower ABC utilization in older individuals, and in those with higher CD4 cell counts, higher cART lines, and prior AIDS. Higher ABC utilization was associated with higher HIV RNA and poor renal function, and was more common in Central-East and Eastern Europe and lowest during 2014. During 779 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) in 2139 individuals starting ABC after 1 January 2009, 113 discontinued ABC within 6 weeks of initiation for any reason [incidence rate (IR) 14.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.1, 17.5) per 100 PYFU], 13 because of reported HSR [IR 0.3 (95% CI 0.1, 1.0) per 100 PYFU] and 35 because of reported HSR/any toxicity [IR 4.5 (95% CI 3.2, 6.3) per 100 PYFU]. There were no factors significantly associated with ABC discontinuation because of reported HSR/any toxicity.  CONCLUSIONS  ABC remains commonly used across Europe and the incidence of discontinuation because of reported HSR was low in our study population.",

The mechanisms linking poor sleep with an increased cardiovascular risk are incompletely understood. We examined whether a high risk of OSA as well as insomnia symptoms are associated with neuroendocrine hormones and coagulation factors in patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction.\r\nMETHODS: We assessed 190 patients (mean age 60\u2009years, 83% men) in terms of OSA risk (STOP screening tool for the assessment of high vs. low OSA risk) and severity of insomnia symptoms (Jenkins Sleep Scale for the assessment of subjective sleep difficulties) within 48\u2009h of an acute coronary intervention. Circulating concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and von Willebrand factor were measured the next morning. The association of OSA risk and insomnia symptoms with neuroendocrine hormones and coagulation factors was computed using multivariate models adjusting for demographic factors, health behaviors, somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, cardiac disease-related variables, and OSA risk in the model for insomnia symptoms, respectively, for insomnia symptoms in the model for OSA risk.\r\nRESULTS: High OSA risk was identified in 41% of patients and clinically relevant insomnia symptoms were reported by 27% of patients. Compared to those with low OSA risk, patients with high OSA risk had lower levels of epinephrine (p\u2009=\u20090.015), norepinephrine (p\u2009=\u20090.049) and cortisol (p\u2009=\u20090.001). More severe insomnia symptoms were associated with higher levels of fibrinogen (p\u2009=\u20090.037), driven by difficulties initiating sleep, and with lower levels of norepinephrine (p\u2009=\u20090.024), driven by difficulties maintaining sleep.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute myocardial infarction, sleep problems are associated with neuroendocrine hormones and coagulation activity. The pattern of these relationships is not uniform for patients with a high risk of OSA and those with insomnia symptoms, and whether they contribute to adverse cardiovascular outcomes needs to be established.",

Der f 2 sensitization is thought to play a minor role in European atopic dogs sensitized to HDM.\r\nOBJECTIVE: The study evaluated the short-term efficacy of a recombinant Der f 2 product in the treatment of naturally sensitized atopic dogs in Switzerland and Hungary.\r\nANIMALS: Fifteen atopic dogs with positive test reactions to Dermatophagoides farinae (Df).\r\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Recombinant Der f 2 allergens were injected subcutaneously at increasing doses once weekly for 6 weeks. Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI-04), pruritus Visual Analog Scale (pVAS) and medication scores were assessed at days 0 and 42. Efficacy was recorded as excellent, good, fair or poor, depending on the number of scores decreasing by more than 50%.\r\nRESULTS: Mean CADESI, pVAS and medication scores at inclusion were 35, 6 and 15 (SD = 30, 2, 7), respectively. At Day 42 the scores decreased to 8, 3 and 5, respectively (Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank tests P = 0.0002, 0.002 and 0.001). Four dogs were classified as excellent responders with a reduction of >50% in all three scores.

        "document": "Title: Rationale and Plan for Vitamin D Food Fortification: A Review and Guidance Paper\nAbstract: Vitamin D deficiency can lead to musculoskeletal diseases such as rickets and osteomalacia, but vitamin D supplementation may also prevent extraskeletal diseases such as respiratory tract infections, asthma exacerbations, pregnancy complications and premature deaths. Vitamin D has a unique metabolism as it is mainly obtained through synthesis in the skin under the influence of sunlight (i.e., ultraviolet-B radiation) whereas intake by nutrition traditionally plays a relatively minor role. Dietary guidelines for vitamin D are based on a consensus that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations are used to assess vitamin D status, with the recommended target concentrations ranging from \u226525 to \u226550 nmol/L (\u226510-\u226520 ng/mL), corresponding to a daily vitamin D intake of 10 to 20 \u03bcg (400-800 international units). Most populations fail to meet these recommended dietary vitamin D requirements. In Europe, 25(OH)D concentrations <30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) and <50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) are present in 13.0 and 40.4% of the general population, respectively. This substantial gap between officially recommended dietary reference intakes for vitamin D and the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the general population requires action from health authorities. Promotion of a healthier lifestyle with more outdoor activities and optimal nutrition are definitely warranted but will not erase vitamin D deficiency and must, in the case of sunlight exposure, be well balanced with regard to potential adverse effects such as skin cancer. Intake of vitamin D supplements is limited by relatively poor adherence (in particular in individuals with low-socioeconomic status) and potential for overdosing. Systematic vitamin D food fortification is, however, an effective approach to improve vitamin D status in the general population, and this has already been introduced by countries such as the US, Canada, India, and Finland. Recent advances in our knowledge on the safety of vitamin D treatment, the dose-response relationship of vitamin D intake and 25(OH)D levels, as well as data on the effectiveness of vitamin D fortification in countries such as Finland provide a solid basis to introduce and modify vitamin D food fortification in order to improve public health with this likewise cost-effective approach.",

        "document": "Title: China in Africa: competition for traditional development finance institutions?\nAbstract: Official development finance from China has risen tremendously in the past two decades across the globe, including in the world\u2019s poorest continent, Africa. How has this sudden increase in development resources affected the two major multilateral development banks (MDBs) in the region, the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB)? One might expect that the MDBs\u2014often described as tools to exert the influence of wealthy western countries\u2014might compete with China to maintain their relevance and influence in Africa. This study undertakes a combination of statistical tests and in-depth interviews with government officials in three recipient countries to see if this is the case, both in terms of overall finance levels as well as in the sectoral distribution of projects. The results indicate that total MDB finance levels by country change little over time regardless of Chinese activity. The same is true for funding levels of traditional bilateral donors. The sectoral allocation of concessional lending does not show any responsiveness either. In contrast, shifts in funding levels overall and in sector allocation can be observed for non-concessional countries; the latter, however, represent only a small minority among the recipients of Chinese finance. Overall, the study suggests that while China\u2019s role in African development finance is indeed substantial and growing, it has not had the \u201cgame changing\u201d impact on traditional development finance as popular perception might lead one to believe. Things may change, however, once more recipient countries develop economically and move into the non-concessional category.",

Using data from 8,458 employed individuals, we examined the combined effects of individuals' actual personality traits and jobs' expert-rated personality demands on earnings. Results from a response surface analysis indicated that the fit between individuals' actual personality and the personality demands of their jobs is a predictor of income. Conclusions of this combined analysis were partly opposite to conclusions reached in previous studies using conventional regression methods. Individuals can earn additional income of more than their monthly salary per year if they hold a job that fits their personality. Thus, at least for some traits, economic success depends not only on having a \"successful personality\" but also, in part, on finding the best niche for one's personality. We discuss the findings with regard to labor-market policies and individuals' job-selection strategies.",

Yet, by requiring that the premium be paid upfront, standard insurance products also transfer income across time. We show that this intertemporal transfer can help explain low insurance demand, especially among the poor, and in a randomized control trial in Kenya we test a crop insurance product which removes it. The product is interlinked with a contract farming scheme: as with other inputs, the buyer of the crop offers the insurance and deducts the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The take-up rate for pay-at-harvest insurance is 72 percent, compared to 5 percent for the standard pay-up-front contract, and the difference is largest among poorer farmers. Additional experiments and outcomes provide evidence on the role of liquidity constraints, present bias, and counterparty risk, and find that enabling farmers to commit to pay the premium just one month later increases demand by 21 percentage points.",

The PROCLIPI (PROspective Cutaneous Lymphoma International Prognostic Index) study is a web\u2010based data collection system for early\u2010stage MF with legal data\u2010sharing agreements permitting international collaboration in a rare cancer with complex pathology. Clinicopathological data must be 100% complete and in\u2010built intelligence in the database system ensures accurate staging. Objectives To develop a prognostic index for MF. Methods Predefined datasets for clinical, haematological, radiological, immunohistochemical, genotypic, treatment and quality of life are collected at first diagnosis of MF and annually to test against survival. Biobanked tissue samples are recorded within a Federated Biobank for translational studies. Results In total, 430 patients were enrolled from 29 centres in 15 countries spanning five continents. Altogether, 348 were confirmed as having early\u2010stage MF at central review. The majority had classical MF (81\u00b76%) with a CD4 phenotype (88\u00b72%). Folliculotropic MF was diagnosed in 17\u00b78%. Most presented with stage I (IA: 49\u00b74%; IB: 42\u00b78%), but 7\u00b78% presented with enlarged lymph nodes (stage IIA). A diagnostic delay between first symptom development and initial diagnosis was frequent [85\u00b76%; median delay 36 months (interquartile range 12\u201390)]. This highlights the difficulties in accurate diagnosis, which includes lack of a singular diagnostic test for MF. Conclusions This confirmed early\u2010stage MF cohort is being followed\u2010up to identify prognostic factors, which may allow better management and improve survival by identifying patients at risk of disease progression. This study design is a useful model for collaboration in other rare diseases, especially where pathological diagnosis can be complex.",

The most common genetic cause is L1CAM-related X-linked hydrocephalus and that explains only 5%-10% of all male cases. This underlines a current limitation in our understanding of the genetic burden of non-syndromic congenital hydrocephalus, especially for those cases with likely autosomal recessive inheritance. Additionally, the prognosis for most cases of severe congenital hydrocephalus is poor, with most of the surviving infants displaying significant intellectual impairment despite surgical intervention. It is for this reason that couples with an antenatal diagnosis of severe hydrocephalus are given the option, and may opt, for termination of the pregnancy. We present two families with CCDC88C-related recessive congenital hydrocephalus with children who had severe hydrocephalus. Those individuals who were shunted within the first few weeks of life, who did not require multiple surgical revisions, and who had a more distal truncating variant of the CCDC88C gene met their early childhood developmental milestones in some cases. This suggests that children with CCDC88C-related autosomal recessive hydrocephalus can have normal developmental outcomes under certain circumstances. We recommend CCDC88C analysis in cases of severe non-syndromic congenital hydrocephalus, especially when aqueduct stenosis with or without a medial diverticulum is seen, in order to aid prognosis discussion.",

Time to death/lung transplantation (LTx) was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. In addition, phenotyping using hirarchical Ward's clustering was performed to characterize high risk subgroups. Cox regression showed - even after adjustment for sex, forced expiratory volume in 1s (%predicted), body mass index (z-score), age at CPET, Pseudomonas aeruginosa status, and CF-related diabetes as covariates in the model - that VO2peak in %predicted, hazard ratio (HR) 0.964 [95%-CI: 0.944-0.986], peak work rate (%predicted, HR 0.969 [0.951-0.988], ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (VE/VO2peak) HR 1.085 [1.041-1.132], and carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2peak), HR 1.060 [1.007-1.115], all P<0.05) were significant predictors of death or LTx at 10 years follow-up. Phenotyping revealed that CPET-derived measures were important for clustering. We identified a high risk cluster characterized by poor lung function, nutritional status and exercise capacity.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, CPET provides additional prognostic information to established predictors of death/LTx in CF. High risk patients may especially benefit from regular monitoring of exercise capacity and exercise counselling.",

Refractory disease and advanced-stage disease require systemic therapy. We report on a rare case of an atypical predominantly CD8+ folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (MF), a subtype of MF with poorer prognosis, in a 59-year-old woman, initially diagnosed with MF restricted to the skin- of T3N0M0B0/stage IIB according to the current WHO/EORTC classification. First-line treatment with local percutaneous radiotherapy in combination with systemic interferon alfa-2a resulted in complete remission. However, 21 months later the disease progressed to T3N0M1B0/stage IVB with development of cerebral manifestation and thus very poor prognosis. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was not a therapeutic option due to the lack of a suitable donor. We initiated methotrexate and cytarabin chemotherapy, followed by high-dose chemotherapy with thiotepa and BCNU with autologous SCT. Despite rapid response and complete remission of the cerebral lesions, disease recurrence of the skin occurred soon after. Interestingly, re-administration of interferon alfa-2a as a maintenance treatment after the salvage autologous SCT resulted in a durable complete remission during the follow-up period of currently 13 months after autologous SCT.",

This study examined individual and interpersonal predictors for EFs in 555 typically developing preschool children aged 2-6 years. Children were recruited from 84 child care centers in the German- and French-speaking parts of Switzerland within the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). A total of 20 potential predictors were assessed at the first measurement (T1). These included eight demographic/biological predictors, such as socioeconomic status, preterm birth, physical activity, and motor skills; six psychological predictors, such as hyperactivity, visual perception, and emotionality; and six interpersonal predictors, such as parenting style and stress, presence of siblings, and days spent in the child care center. The predictive value of these variables on EFs 1 year later (T2) was assessed using both standard multiple regression analysis and penalized regression to avoid overfitting due to the number of potential predictors. Female sex (\u03b2 = 0.14), socio-economic status (\u03b2 = 0.15), fine motor skills (\u03b2 = 0.17), visual perception at T1 (\u03b2 = 0.16), and EFs at T1 (\u03b2 = 0.30) were all associated with EFs at T2, exhibiting small to medium effect sizes. All predictors together accounted for 31% of the variability in EFs. However, none of the interpersonal predictors were significant. Thus, we conclude that most of the factors that can predict EFs in preschool age are individual variables, and these tend to be more difficult to influence than interpersonal factors. In fact, children from families with low socio-economic status may be particularly vulnerable to poor EFs. Furthermore, encouraging fine motor skills early in life may support the development of EFs.",

Implementation of GA1 into newborn screening (NBS) programs has improved the short-term outcome. It remains unclear, however, whether NBS changes the long-term outcome and which variables are predictive.  METHODS  This prospective, observational, multicenter study includes 87 patients identified by NBS, 4 patients missed by NBS, and 3 women with GA1 identified by positive NBS results of their unaffected children.  RESULTS  The study population comprises 98.3% of individuals with GA1 identified by NBS in Germany during 1999-2016. Overall, cumulative sensitivity of NBS is 95.6%, but it is lower (84%) for patients with low excreter phenotype. The neurologic outcome of patients missed by NBS is as poor as in the pre-NBS era, and the clinical phenotype of diagnosed patients depends on the quality of therapeutic interventions rather than noninterventional variables. Presymptomatic start of treatment according to current guideline recommendations clearly improves the neurologic outcome (MD: 7% of patients), whereas delayed emergency treatment results in acute onset MD (100%), and deviations from maintenance treatment increase the risk of insidious onset MD (50%). Independent of the neurologic phenotype, kidney function tends to decline with age, a nonneurologic manifestation not predicted by any variable included in this study.  INTERPRETATION  NBS is a beneficial, disease-changing intervention for GA1. However, improved neurologic outcome critically depends on adherence to recommended therapy, whereas kidney dysfunction does not appear to be impacted by recommended therapy.

Disease causing biallelic variants in ACAD9 have been reported in individuals presenting with lactic acidosis and cardiomyopathy.\r\nRESULTS We describe the genetic, clinical and biochemical findings in a cohort of 70 patients, of whom 29 previously unpublished. We found 34 known and 18 previously unreported variants in ACAD9. No patients harbored biallelic loss of function mutations, indicating that this combination is unlikely to be compatible with life. Causal pathogenic variants were distributed throughout the entire gene, and there was no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation. Most of the patients presented in the first year of life. For this subgroup the survival was poor (50% not surviving the first 2 years) comparing to patients with a later presentation (more than 90% surviving 10\u00a0years). The most common clinical findings were cardiomyopathy (85%), muscular weakness (75%) and exercise intolerance (72%). Interestingly, severe intellectual deficits were only reported in one patient and severe developmental delays in four patients. More than 70% of the patients were able to perform the same activities of daily living when compared to peers.\r\nCONCLUSIONS ur data show that riboflavin treatment improves complex I activity in the majority of patient-derived fibroblasts tested. This effect was also reported for most of the treated patients and is mirrored in the survival data. In the patient group with disease-onset below 1 year of age, we observed a statistically-significant better survival for patients treated with riboflavin.",

We link parental education and family structure during childhood to male\u2013female and brother\u2013sister differences in adolescent outcomes, educational attainment, and adult earnings and employment. Our results are consistent with U.S. findings that boys benefit more from an advantageous family environment than do girls in terms of grade-school outcomes. Father\u2019s education, which has not been examined in previous studies, is particularly important for sons. However, we find a very different pattern of parental influence on adult outcomes. Gender gaps in educational attainment, employment, and earnings are increasing in maternal education, benefiting daughters. Paternal education decreases the gender gaps in educational attainment (favoring sons) and labor market outcomes (favoring daughters). We conclude that differences in the behavior of school-aged boys and girls may be poor proxies for differences in skills that drive longer-term outcomes.",

Improving the availability of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) is a cornerstone for increasing HH compliance.  Methods  In this study, we introduced wearable dispensers for ABHR in an Emergency Department (ED) well equipped with mounted ABHR dispensers and accompanied this single-modal intervention by a quasi-experimental mixed-method study. The study was performed in the ED of the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, a 950-bed tertiary teaching hospital. During a five-week baseline period and a seven-week intervention period, we observed HH compliance according to the WHO 'Five Moments' concept, measured ABHR consumption, and investigated perceived ABHR availability, self-reported HH compliance and knowledge of HH indications by questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent determinants for HH compliance. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted and thematically analyzed to assess barriers and facilitators for the use of the newly introduced dispensers.  Results  Across 811 observed HH opportunities, the HH compliance for all moments was 56% (95% confidence interval (CI), 51-62%) during baseline and 64% (CI, 59-68%) during intervention period, respectively. In the multivariable analysis adjusted for sex, profession, and WHO HH moment, there was no difference in HH compliance between baseline and intervention (adjusted Odds ratio: 1.22 (0.89-1.66), \u2009=\u20090.22), No significant changes were observed in consumption and perceived availability of ABHR. During intervention, 7.5% ABHR was consumed using wearable dispensers. HCP perceived wearable dispensers as unnecessary since mounted dispensers were readily accessible. Poor ergonomic design of the wearable dispenser emerged as a main barrier, especially its lid and fastening mechanism. Interviewees identified two ideal situations for wearable dispensers, HCP who accompany patients from ED to other wards, and HCP approaching a patient from a non-patient areas in the ED such as the central working station or the meeting room.  Conclusion  The introduction of wearable dispensers did not increase observed hand hygiene compliance or ABHR consumption in an ED already well equipped with mounted dispensers. For broader acceptance and use, wearable dispensers might benefit from an optimized ergonomic design.",

While the limited availability of public resources encourages targeting, the difficulty to identify the poor promotes a universal allocation of benefits. To address this question, this study examines the targeting performance of and access to a social welfare scheme for an increasingly vulnerable group \u2013 India\u2019s poor older people. The results show that during a time period of social pension reforms, exclusion and inclusion errors were successfully reduced but the exclusion of poor older people continues to be extremely high. Comparing the existing targeting approach to a random allocation, I show that the benefits of targeting are limited. The reforms aimed at increasing the transparency of social pension allocation indeed made the Below Poverty Line ration card the most important determinant of access to social pensions for older people. However, this focus on the ration card promoted by the national government has its own weaknesses. Non-poor older people exploit the unwarranted possession of this ration card and results suggest that after the reforms individuals with direct connections to local government officials are more likely to access social pension benefits. The current targeting approach seems to be beneficial for well-connected older individuals while many poor older people typically lacking these connections lag behind.",

Reliable estimates of the global burden of kidney disease require more population-based studies, but specific risks occur across the socioeconomic spectrum from poverty to affluence, from malnutrition to obesity, in agrarian to post-industrial settings, and along the life course from newborns to older people. A range of communicable and noncommunicable diseases result in renal complications and many people who have kidney disease lack access to care. The causes, consequences and costs of kidney diseases have implications for public health policy in all countries. The risks of kidney disease are also influenced by ethnicity, gender, location and lifestyle.\u00a0 Increasing economic and health disparities, migration, demographic transition, unsafe working conditions and environmental threats, natural disasters and pollution may thwart attempts to reduce the morbidity and mortality from kidney disease. A multisectoral approach is needed to tackle the global burden of kidney disease. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) emphasize the importance of a multisectoral approach to health. We map the actions towards achieving all of the SDGs that have the potential to improve understanding, measurement, prevention and treatment of kidney disease in all age groups. These actions can also foster treatment innovations and reduce the burden of such disease in future generations.",

Children with genetic anomalies were excluded. Scores were compared with reference data of children with biventricular CHD. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify determinants of health-related quality of life.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Health-related quality of life in pre-schoolers with single-ventricle CHD was comparable to children with biventricular CHD. Preterm birth and perioperative variables were significant predictors of low health-related quality of life.

Children with recognized genetic disorders were excluded. Growth (weight, height, and head circumference [HC]) was assessed at birth, before surgery, and at 1, 4, and 6 years and compared with Swiss growth charts. IQ was assessed at 6 years using standardized tests. Univariate and multivariable linear regressions were performed to determine predictors of HC and IQ at 6 years.\r\nRESULTS HC at birth was in the low average range (33rd percentile, P\u2009=\u2009.03), and weight (49th percentile, P\u2009=\u2009.23) and length (47th percentile, P\u2009=\u2009.06) were normal. All growth measures declined until the first surgery, with a catch-up growth until 6 years for height (44th percentile, P\u2009=\u2009.07) but not for weight (39th percentile, P\u2009=\u2009.003) or for HC (23rd percentile, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Children undergoing univentricular palliation showed poorer height growth than other types of CHD (P\u2009=\u2009.01). Median IQ at 6 years was 95 (range 50-135). Lower IQ at 6 years was independently predicted by lower HC at birth, lower socioeconomic status, older age at first bypass surgery, and longer length of intensive care unit stay.\r\nCONCLUSIONS Smaller HC at birth and postnatal factors are predictive of impaired intellectual abilities at school age. Early identification should alert clinicians to provide early childhood interventions to optimize developmental potential.",

While initial cohort-descriptions summarized the spectrum of clinical and immunological manifestations, questions about long-term disease evolution and response to therapy remain. The prospective European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID)-APDS registry aims to characterize the disease course, identify outcome predictors, and evaluate treatment responses. So far, 77 patients have been recruited (51 APDS1, 26 APDS2). Analysis of disease evolution in the first 68 patients pinpoints the early occurrence of recurrent respiratory infections followed by chronic lymphoproliferation, gastrointestinal manifestations, and cytopenias. Although most manifestations occur by age 15, adult-onset and asymptomatic courses were documented. Bronchiectasis was observed in 24/40 APDS1 patients who received a CT-scan compared with 4/15 APDS2 patients. By age 20, half of the patients had received at least one immunosuppressant, but 2-3 lines of immunosuppressive therapy were not unusual before age 10. Response to rapamycin was rated by physician visual analog scale as good in 10, moderate in 9, and poor in 7. Lymphoproliferation showed the best response (8 complete, 11 partial, 6 no remission), while bowel inflammation (3 complete, 3 partial, 9 no remission) and cytopenia (3 complete, 2 partial, 9 no remission) responded less well. Hence, non-lymphoproliferative manifestations should be a key target for novel therapies. This report from the ESID-APDS registry provides comprehensive baseline documentation for a growing cohort that will be followed prospectively to establish prognostic factors and identify patients for treatment studies.",

METHODS:  In this quantitative cross-sectional study, we compared 50 patients in a psychiatric acute ward setting, who were looking for a residence in a sheltered housing facility with 50 patients in a sheltered housing facility using structured interviews. RESULTS:  Patients living in a sheltered housing facility reported less unmet needs. However, no differences regarding inclusion and participation were found. More unmet needs were associated with poorer quality of life, and less social inclusion in both groups. CONCLUSIONS:  Patients in sheltered housing facilities report less unmet needs. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed to regarding inclusion of these patients. A \"supported inclusion\"-approach should be considered.

        "document": "Title: IKZF1 Defines a New Minimal Residual Disease-Dependent Very-Poor Prognostic Profile in Pediatric B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nAbstract: Purpose Somatic deletions that affect the lymphoid transcription factor-coding gene IKZF1 have previously been reported as independently associated with a poor prognosis in pediatric B-cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have now refined the prognostic strength of IKZF1 deletions by analyzing the effect of co-occurring deletions. Patients and Methods The analysis involved 991 patients with BCP ALL treated in the Associazione Italiana Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (AIEOP-BFM) ALL 2000 trial with complete information for copy number alterations of IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, EBF1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, Xp22.33/Yp11.31 (PAR1 region; CRLF2, CSF2RA, and IL3RA), and ERG; replication of findings involved 417 patients from the same trial. Results IKZF1 deletions that co-occurred with deletions in CDKN2A, CDKN2B, PAX5, or PAR1 in the absence of ERG deletion conferred the worst outcome and, consequently, were grouped as IKZF1. The IKZF1 group comprised 6% of patients with BCP ALL, with a 5-year event-free survival of 53 \u00b1 6% compared with 79 \u00b1 5% in patients with IKZF1 deletion who did not fulfill the IKZF1 definition and 87 \u00b1 1% in patients who lacked an IKZF1 deletion ( P \u2264 .001). Respective 5-year cumulative relapse incidence rates were 44 \u00b1 6%, 11 \u00b1 4%, and 10 \u00b1 1% ( P \u2264 .001). Results were confirmed in the replication cohort, and multivariable analyses demonstrated independence of IKZF1. The IKZF1 prognostic effect differed dramatically in analyses stratified by minimal residual disease (MRD) levels after induction treatment: 5-year event-free survival for MRD standard-risk IKZF1 patients was 94 \u00b1 5% versus 40 \u00b1 10% in MRD intermediate- and 30 \u00b1 14% in high-risk IKZF1 patients ( P \u2264 .001). Corresponding 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse rates were 6 \u00b1 6%, 60 \u00b1 10%, and 60 \u00b1 17% ( P \u2264 .001). Conclusion IKZF1 describes a new MRD-dependent very-poor prognostic profile in BCP ALL. Because current AIEOP-BFM treatment is largely ineffective for MRD-positive IKZF1 patients, new experimental treatment approaches will be evaluated in our upcoming trial AIEOP-BFM ALL 2017.",

However, its significance in patients with narrow QRS treated with CRT is unknown.  OBJECTIVES  The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of mechanical activation delay by CCA with study outcome in patients with HF enrolled in the EchoCRT trial.  METHODS  Baseline CCA could be performed from tissue Doppler imaging in the apical views in 807 of 809 (99.7%) enrolled patients, and 6-month follow-up could be performed in 610 of 635 (96%) patients with available echocardiograms. Patients with a pre-specified maximal activation delay \u226535 ms were considered to have significant delay. The study outcome was HF hospitalization or death.  RESULTS  Of 807 patients, 375 (46%) did not have delayed mechanical activation at baseline by CCA. Patients without delayed mechanical activation who were randomized to CRT-On compared with CRT-Off had an increased risk of poor outcome (hazard ratio: 1.70; 95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 2.55; p = 0.01) with a significant interaction term (p = 0.04) between delayed mechanical activation and device randomization for the endpoint. Among patients with paired baseline and follow-up data with no events before 6-month follow-up (n = 541), new-onset delayed mechanical activation in the CRT-On group showed a significant increase in unfavorable events (hazard ratio: 3.73; 95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 12.14; p = 0.03).  CONCLUSIONS  In the EchoCRT population, absence of delayed mechanical activation by CCA was significantly associated with poor outcomes, possibly due to the onset of new delayed mechanical activation with CRT pacing.

We evaluated gemtuzumab ozogamicin (CD33-targeted drug) used on a compassionate basis in patients diagnosed from 1995 until 2014 within Acute Myeloid Leukemia Berlin-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster studies, and identified 76 patients (<18 years) with highly-advanced and pre-treated AML [refractory  acute myeloid leukemia (n=10),  AML refractory to relapse (1 early: n=41; 1 late: n=10; 2 or more: n=10), and secondary AML (n=5)]. At doses of 2.5-10 mg/m, gemtuzumab ozogamicin was administered in 1-4 cycles as single agent (47%), combined with cytarabine (47%), or others (6%). Most common grade 3/4 adverse events were infections or febrile neutropenia (78% of severe adverse events), infusion-related immunological reactions (6%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (5%). Three patients experienced veno-occlusive disease (one fatal due to exacerbation of a pre-existing cardiomyopathy). Sixty-four percent received subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Probability of 4-year overall survival was 18\u00b15% in all, 27\u00b17% in patients with and 0% in patients without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (<0.0001). Administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on a patient-specific, compassionate use basis was frequently considered in our study group and proved to be effective for bridging children with very advanced AML to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Little is known about best treatment of primary metastatic disease (MD) or relapsed metastatic disease (rMD).\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS  Patients with localized disease (LD), primary MD, and metastatic recurrence after complete remission (CR) treated within the CWS-86, -91, -96, -2002P trials and the recent registry SoTiSaR (1985-2016) were analyzed.\r\nRESULTS  Fifteen of 61 patients had primary metastases at initial diagnosis at the age of 14.6\u00a0years (range, 7.8-19.7). Nine of 46 patients with initial LD suffered of rMD at a median age of 9.9\u00a0years (range, 3.5-30), 3.75 years (0.75-21) after CR of primary disease. Complete resection (microscopically or macroscopically) was possible in 2 of 15 patients with MD and in 5 of 9 with rMD. RT was administered in 4 of 15 MD and 1 of 9 rMD. Chemotherapy was administered to 11 of 15\u00a0MD and 3 of 9\u00a0rMD, targeted therapy to 3 of 15\u00a0MD and 1 of 9\u00a0rMD.

Running multivariate regression models and using 1,805 observations of microfinance institutions between 2004 and 2013, we find strong evidence suggesting that institutions with more social engagement \u2013 in terms of outreach to the poor \u2013 earn higher portfolio yields. We also find that measures of outreach are associated with increased operating expenses. As return figures are influenced by both costs and yield, and because both increase to a similar degree with the depth of outreach, these two effects lead to a zero sum result on return measures. This finding could explain why existing studies assessing the interaction between social outreach and different measures of financial performance in microfinance (such as return on assets/equity, operating expenses, operational self-sufficiency) have not produced consistent results.",

The association between time discounting and the position in the wealth distribution is significant and of the same magnitude as the association between length of education and the position in the wealth distribution, and it exists after controlling for education, school grades, income, initial wealth, parental wealth, and credit constraints.

        "document": "Title: Development from below - alternative poverty alleviation, its rationale and operationalisation through a systemic learning approach : the MAYA ORGANIC pilot project in Bangalore, India\nAbstract: This thesis elaborates the systemic shortcomings of policies and projects in India and the need for alternative, practical solutions, which are a) scalable, b) replicable and c) market oriented in order to have a systemic impact on poverty. Poverty is being discussed as a structural phenomenon, which is multi-dimensional and a consequence of social, economic and political exclusion. Change can only be achieved if interventions address these shortcomings, while being multidimensional and process oriented. Access to economic, political and social resources needs to be complemented with institutional and individual capabilities and enable the working poor to make productive use of these newly available resources. MAYA ORGANIC, the case study of this thesis and a pilot project itself, attempts to address the problems faced by informal, tiny manufacturing workers and enterprises in India in a systemic way through umbrella structures for marketing and design, supply chain management andfinally training and enterprise formation.The author herself, one of the co-founders, utilises an action research methodology and focuses on the parameters that are required for democratic self-managed structures (collective enterprises) and institutionalised learning processes to build worker's and group enterprises' capabilities to be more self-managed and hence, more self-directed. She further has refined the enterprise model and maturity stages of enterprises and how such an initiative can be scalable and replicable, while fulfilling the challenges of social, economic and political  inclusion of the working poor in informal manufacturing into the mainstream. \r\nDiese Dissertation zeigt systemische Schwaechen der bestehenden Armutspolitik und projekte in Indien auf und weist auf die Notwendigkeit multi-dimensionaler und systemisch angelegter Interventionen hin, um nachhaltig zu sein. Armut artikuliert sich auf verschiedenen Ebenen und ist eine Folge von systemischen Ausschlussmechanismen auf wirtschaftlicher, politischer und sozialer Ebene. Die Autorin argumentiert, dass der oft propagierte Zugang zu Ressourcen (Finanzen, Maerkte, Technologie, Training) eine notwendige, allerdings nicht hinreichende Bedingung schafft fuer nachhaltige Armutsbekaempfung, und daher institutionelle und individuelle Faehigkeiten aufgebaut werden muessen, damit die neuen Ressourcen von den Betroffenen auch produktiv voumgesetzt werden kaennen. Sie stellt in einer Fallstudie das Pilotprojekt MAYA ORGANIC vor, welches im informellen Manufakturbereich neben Marketing und Design auch Supply Chain Prozesse, Berufsbildung und Unternehmensbildung einfuehrt und kontinuierliches und reflektives Lernen institutionalisiert. Dadurch soll sichergestellt werden, dass die Zielgruppe ihre Entscheidungen vermehrt unabhaengig und selbstaendig faellt. Eine Aktionsforschung begleitete diesen Prozess und leitete die Interdependenz zwischen demokratischen Kleinststrukturen, institutionellem Lernen und Selbstbestimmtheit her. Diese neu erlernten Faehigkeiten sollen sicherstellen, dass die durch MAYA ORGANIC zur Verfuegung gestellten Ressourcen sich im Erfolg der Kleinunternehmung und verbesserten \r\nLebensbedingungen (langfristige Planung etc.) widerspiegeln und dadurch Nachhaltigkeit geschafft wird. Die Autorin, selber eine Mitinitiantin von MAYA ORGANIC, konsolidiert die verschiedenen Meilensteine dieses Prozesses, die als Grundlage zur weiteren Verfeinerung des Unternehmensmodells Bedeutung erlangen. Schliesslich diskutiert sie, unter welchen Bedingungen dieses Modell in anderen Regionen und Industrien Indiens in grossangelegten Projekten replizierbar und die Einschliessung der informellen Kleinstunternehmen im Manufakturbereich in den 'Mainstream' sichergestgellt werden kann.",

Das Chinabild ist dazu da, die Vielf\u00e4ltigkeit tagesaktueller Informationen zu China in eine zusammenh\u00e4ngende Geschichte hineinzuerz\u00e4hlen. Dies ist das Problem, das mit dem Chinabild gel\u00f6st werden soll und auch tats\u00e4chlich gel\u00f6st wird. Die Entstehung, Beschaffenheit und Fortexistenz des Wissens \u00fcber China erkl\u00e4rt sich daran, wie gut es diese Funktion erf\u00fcllt. Dies lenkt den Blick in Richtung der Kriterien an denen sich der Grad der Funktionserf\u00fcllung misst. Die Theorie gibt ein Suchschema an die Hand, um solche Kriterien aufzudecken und benennt sie f\u00fcr den hier untersuchten Fall.\r\nDie in dieser Studie herausgearbeiteten Chinabilder k\u00f6nnen funktional erkl\u00e4rt werden, weil sie in der Lage sind, den t\u00e4glichen Nachrichtenfluss in einen Zusammenhang zu integrieren, der den Kriterien der Funktionserf\u00fcllung entspricht. Die gefundenen Chinabilder bestehen aus einem bew\u00e4hrten Angebot an Wissen \u00fcber China. Aus der Sicht der Kommentatoren in den Foren kann man sich auf sie verlassen. Wer sich einem solchen Chinabild anvertraut, hat ein geringes Risiko, am Erz\u00e4hlen einer Geschichte \u00fcber China zu scheitern und etwa durch die Rede des Gegners in unaufl\u00f6sbare Widerspr\u00fcche verwickelt zu werden. Zugleich kann er darauf z\u00e4hlen, dass er gen\u00fcgen Zustimmung ernten wird. Chinabilder stellen Anleitungen und Deutungsschablonen zur Erzeugung von Tagesrealit\u00e4t bereit, um den Informationsfluss in eine Geschichte hineinzuerz\u00e4hlen, die den vielf\u00e4ltigen Anforderungen (mehr oder weniger) entspricht.  As a result of the economic and political rise of China, the beginning of the 21st century has made it necessary to re-evaluate China\u2019s image. Communism, standardized uniforms, Mao, the Cultural Revolution, backwardness, poverty and famine do not fit hand in hand with news reports of booming megacities and double-figure growth rates. New certainties are required in order to establish what the vast empire in the Far East is all about. Starting with the qualitative investigation of online comments on China, this thesis develops a theory on the image of China found in Internet forums. To this end, the theory identifies images of China and provides a functional explanation to their nature.\r\nThe role of the images of China can be seen as bringing the news flow of mass media coverage into a continuous coherence. The image of China exists as a means of retelling the wealth of up-to-the-minute information on China as a consistent and clear story. This is the challenge that the image of China seeks to overcome \u2013 and indeed does. The emergence, nature and continued existence of knowledge on China can be explained by how well the image fulfils this function. It draws attention towards the criteria used to measure the extent to which this function is fulfilled. The theory provides a search scheme, which detects and names the criteria needed for the case study.\r\nThe images of China carved out here are able to provide a functional explanation, because they can integrate the daily news flow into a coherency that corresponds to the function fulfilling criteria. The images of China that are found consist of a proven supply of knowledge on China. From the perspective of the forums\u2019 commentators, these images are reliable. Anyone placing trust in such an image of China has little risk of foundering in telling a story about China and, for example, become inextricably entwined in contradictions presented by an opponent. At the same time, the storyteller can count on sufficient affirmation. Images of China supply both guidance and templates for interpretation in order to the generation of day reality, thereby retelling the flow of information in a coherent story that (more or less) reflects wide-ranging demands.",

        "document": "Title: Novel transcatheter therapies for treating tricuspid regurgitation\nAbstract: Until recently, tricuspid valve (TV) disease has been relatively neglected for a long time, but recently tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has attracted attention. Although the prognosis of patients with these disorders is poor, the high mortality and morbidity associated with TV surgery have resulted in many patients not receiving surgical therapy. Current guidelines recommend that TV surgery should be considered in patients with severe TR who are symptomatic or have progressive right ventricle (RV) dilatation or dysfunction. In the absence of severe RV or left ventricle (LV) dysfunction, surgery should be considered in cases of severe pulmonary vascular disease or hypertension; however, it is difficult to assess RV dysfunction. Symptoms of right heart failure are more nonspecific and difficult to diagnose than those of left heart failure. Furthermore, the severity of TR is easily influenced by the use of diuretics. These factors lead to difficulties in patient selection and in determination of optimal timing for surgery. Transcatheter therapies for TR have begun to emerge as an alternative for patients with severe symptomatic TR who are at high-risk for standard surgery. Although initial results from a recent international multicenter registry have demonstrated that transcatheter TV therapy is feasible and safe, its clinical experience is still under development. In the present review, we describe the currently available techniques of transcatheter TV intervention and preliminary clinical results.",

        "document": "Title: Pleural mesothelioma: is the surgeon still there?\nAbstract: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy with some unique characteristics. Tumor biology is aggressive and prognosis is poor. Despite more knowledge on histology, tumor biology and staging, there is still a relevant discrepancy between clinical and pathologic staging resulting in difficult prediction of prognosis and treatment outcome, making treatment allocation more challenging than in most other malignancies. After years of nihilism in the late 80s, a period of activism started evaluating different treatment protocols combined with research driven mainly by academic centers; at the time, selection was based on histology and stage only. This period was important to gain knowledge about the disease. However, the interpretation of data was difficult since selection criteria and definitions varied substantially. Not surprisingly, until now there is no common agreement on best treatment even among specialists. Hence, a review of our current concepts is indicated and personalized treatment should become applicable in the future. Surgery was and still is an issue of debate. In principle, surgery is an effective approach as it allows macroscopic complete elimination of a tumor, which is relatively resistant to medical treatment. It helps to set the clock back and other therapies that have also just a limited effect can be applied sequentially before or after surgery. Furthermore, to date best long-term outcome is reported from surgical series in combination with other modalities. However, part of the community considers surgery associated with too high morbidity and mortality when balanced to the limited life expectancy. This criticism is understandable, since poor results after surgery are reported. The present article will review the indication for surgery and discuss the different procedures available for macroscopic complete resection-such as lung-preserving (extended) pleurectomy/decortication as well as extrapleural pneumonectomy to illustrate that 'The surgeon is still there!'",

This is partly due to data normalization primarily addressing technical variability within independent screens, and not the technical differences between them.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nWe present \"rscreenorm\", a method that standardizes the functional data ranges between screens using assay controls, and subsequently performs a piecewise-linear normalization to make data distributions across all screens comparable. In simulation studies, rscreenorm reduces false positives. Using two multiple-cell lines siRNA screens, rscreenorm increased reproducibility between 27 and 62% for hits, and up to 5-fold for non-hits. Using publicly available CRISPR-Cas screen data, application of commonly used median centering yields merely 34% of overlapping hits, in contrast with rscreenorm yielding 84% of overlapping hits. Furthermore, rscreenorm yielded at most 8% discordant results, whilst median-centering yielded as much as 55%.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nRscreenorm yields more consistent results and keeps false positive rates under control, improving reproducibility of genetic screens data analysis from multiple cell lines.",

This scenario of irregular and insalubrious working conditions may be related to an increase in psychiatric disorders and overweight. In particular, low levels of physical activity and high work stress levels may predispose police officers to obesity, poor lifestyles, and, consequently, major risk of psychological disorders. Thus, our aim was to profile the anxiety/depression symptoms and habitual physical activity (HPA) levels of Brazilian elite police officers classified by body mass index (BMI).\r\nPatients and methods:  Eighty-seven male police officers classified as normal-weight (NG, BMI =18.5-24.9 kg/m2, n=34) and excess-weight (EG, BMI \u226525 kg/m2, n=53) completed (before work routine time) the questionnaires: Baecke (HPA levels), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (anxiety), and Beck Depression Inventory (depression).\r\nResults:  There was a slight trend (despite did not reach statistical significance) of the EG group (which have a significantly [P=0.0369] higher mean [8.8\u00b17.6] of military service time [in years] when compared to NG group [5.8\u00b16.0]) presenting higher values of anxiety-trait (+5.0%) and depression (+16.0%) and lower levels of leisure time HPA (-3.7%) than NG group.\r\nConclusion:  Although our hypothesis was not ratified, our findings have clinical relevance because we profiled the anxiety and depression symptoms and HPA levels of elite police officers. Moreover, it is possible to suppose that the military service time (years) is a relevant factor, that it needs to be studied in depth, and that it may impact the predisposition for mood disorders and low levels of physical activity of police officers.",

Multiple experiments in the Kenyan dairy sector show that: (i) farmers are willing to incur sizable costs to receive infrequent payments as a commitment device, (ii) poor contract enforcement, however, limits competition among buyers in the supply of infrequent payments. We then present a model of demand and supply of infrequent payments and test its additional predictions.",

IGCCCG risk group assignment was correctly performed with pre-chemotherapy marker levels and additionally with pre-orchiectomy marker levels. Agreement between pre-chemotherapy and pre-orchiectomy risk group assignments was assessed using Cohen's kappa.\r\nRESULTS\r\nOur cohort consisted of 83 patients. The use of pre-orchiectomy TMs resulted in an IGCCCG risk group upstaging in 12 patients (16%, 8 patients from good to intermediate risk and 4 patients from intermediate to poor risk) and a downstaging in 1 patient (1.2%, from intermediate- to good-risk). The agreement between pre-orchiectomy and pre-chemotherapy IGCCCG risk groups resulted in a Cohen's kappa of 0.888 (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nUsing pre-orchiectomy TMs can result in incorrect IGCCCG risk group assignment, which in turn can impact on the clinical management and follow-up of patients with metastatic GCT. Thus, adherence to the IGCCCG standard using pre-chemotherapy TMs levels is recommended.",

Ischemic stroke (IS) shows an age- and sex-dependent distribution in which men represent the most affected population within 65\u202fyears of age, being passed by post-menopausal women in older age groups. Furthermore, a sexual dimorphism concerning risk factors, presentation and treatment of IS has been widely recognized. In order to address these phenomena, a number of issue have been raised involving both socio-economical and biological factors. The latter can be either dependent on sex hormones or due to intrinsic factors. Although women have poorer outcomes and are more likely to die after a cerebrovascular event, they are still underrepresented in clinical trials and this is mirrored by the lack of sex-tailored therapies. A greater effort is needed in the future to ensure improved treatment and quality of life to both sexes.",

To our knowledge, a direct comparison of the Penumbra Apollo (Penumbra Inc, Alameda, California, US) and Nico BrainPath (Indianapolis, Indiana, US) system has not yet been performed. Methods A retrospective review of image-guided, minimally invasive evacuation of intracerebral hematomas performed at one academic institution in the United States between July 2015 and July 2017 was performed. Cases performed with the Apollo and BrainPath system were matched based on age, gender, hematoma location and laterality, and volume. Results Twenty-four patients underwent surgery using either of the two minimally invasive surgical systems and five cases in each group were matched for age, gender, hematoma location and laterality, and volume. Median time from symptom onset to evacuation was two days with a mean distance from the brain surface to the\u00a0clot of approximately 40 millimeters in both groups. Both techniques achieved comparable clot evacuation. The functional outcome was poor with either technique with the majority of patients dependent or dead at last follow-up. Conclusions In the present, small, matched cohort study, both the Apollo and BrainPath techniques achieved satisfactory clot evacuation. Nevertheless, the\u00a0functional outcome in this patient population remains poor in the majority of cases.",

Results of a multicenter international\u00a0study\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION:\r\nPeritoneal metastasis (PM) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without distant spread are rare. The related prognosis is poor without standard treatment available. The role of cytoreduction surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is poorly documented.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nAn international multicentric cohort was constituted by retrospective analysis of 21 patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC for PM of HCC between 1992 and 2016 from 10 reference centers of PSOGI. Data on clinical features, treatment strategies, and survival outcomes were analyzed.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe median time interval from the diagnosis of PM to the procedure was 4.5 months. The median peritoneal cancer index was 14. Sixteen patients had complete cytoreduction (CCR0-1). Ten patients had grades 3 to 4 complications. The median duration of follow-up was 52.2 months. The median OS was 46.7 months. The projected 3y-OS and 5y-OS were 88.9 and 49.4% respectively. The median OS for patients with CCR0-1 resection was not reached whereas it was 5.9 months for those with CCR2-3 resection after CRS (p = 0.0005). The median RFS was 26.3 months and projected RFS at 3 years of 36.5 months Three prognostic factors were associated with improved RFS in the univariate analysis: preoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.0156), PCI >15 (p = 0.009), Number of chemotherapy agents used for HIPEC (p = 0.005).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nCRS/HIPEC is a safe and effective approach in selected patients with PM of HCC. CRS/HIPEC gives the patient a chance for a good relapse free and overall survival and should be considered as an option",

Emerging data indicate that they may be associated with endothelial dysfunction. No studies have tested whether hot flashes are associated with endothelial function using physiologic measures of hot flashes. We tested whether physiologically assessed hot flashes were associated with poorer endothelial function. We also considered whether age modified associations.\r\nMETHODS:  Two hundred seventy-two nonsmoking women reporting either daily hot flashes or no hot flashes, aged 40 to 60 years, and free of clinical cardiovascular disease, underwent ambulatory physiologic hot flash and diary hot flash monitoring; a blood draw; and ultrasound measurement of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation to assess endothelial function. Associations between hot flashes and flow-mediated dilation were tested in linear regression models controlling for lumen diameter, demographics, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and estradiol.\r\nRESULTS:  In multivariable models incorporating cardiovascular disease risk factors, significant interactions by age (P\u200a<\u200a0.05) indicated that among the younger tertile of women in the sample (age 40-53 years), the presence of hot flashes (beta [standard error]\u200a=\u200a-2.07 [0.79], P\u200a=\u200a0.01), and more frequent physiologic hot flashes (for each hot flash: beta [standard error]\u200a=\u200a-0.10 [0.05], P\u200a=\u200a0.03, multivariable) were associated with lower flow-mediated dilation. Associations were not accounted for by estradiol. Associations were not observed among the older women (age 54-60 years) or for self-reported hot flash frequency, severity, or bother. Among the younger women, hot flashes explained more variance in flow-mediated dilation than standard cardiovascular disease risk factors or estradiol.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:  Among younger midlife women, frequent hot flashes were associated with poorer endothelial function and may provide information about women's vascular status beyond cardiovascular disease risk factors and estradiol.",

Some evidence indicates that women may be particularly vulnerable; increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers with sleep disturbances are primarily observed among women. Midlife, which encompasses the menopause transition, is typically reported as a time of poor sleep. We tested whether poorer objectively measured sleep characteristics were related to a poorer inflammatory profile in midlife women.\r\nMethods:  Two hundred ninety-five peri- and postmenopausal women aged 40-60 completed 3 days of wrist actigraphy, physiologic hot flash monitoring, questionnaires (e.g. Berlin sleep apnea risk questionnaire], and a blood draw for the assessment of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen. Associations of objective (actigraphy) sleep with inflammatory markers were tested in regression models. Sleep efficiency was inverse log transformed. Covariates included age, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, sleep apnea risk, homeostatic model assessment (a measure of insulin resistance), systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and physical activity.\r\nResults:  In separate models controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and education, lower sleep efficiency was associated with higher IL-6 [b(SE) = .02 (.10), p = .003] and VWF [b(SE) = .02 (.08), p = .002]. More minutes awake after sleep onset was associated with higher VWF [b(SE) = .12 (.06), p = .01]. Findings persisted in multivariable models.\r\nConclusions:  Lower sleep efficiency and more minutes awake after sleep onset were independently associated with higher circulating levels of VWF. Lower sleep efficiency was associated with higher circulating levels of IL-6. These findings suggest that sleep disturbances are associated with greater circulating inflammation in midlife women.",

However, little research has considered whether trauma exposure is related to endothelial function, a key process in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We tested whether exposure to traumatic experiences was related to poorer endothelial function among midlife women, independent of CVD risk factors, demographic factors, psychosocial factors, or a history of childhood abuse.\r\nMethods: In all, 272 nonsmoking perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 40 to 60 years without clinical CVD completed the Brief Trauma Questionnaire, the Child Trauma Questionnaire, physical measures, a blood draw, and a brachial ultrasound for assessment of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Relations between trauma and FMD were tested in linear regression models controlling for baseline vessel diameter, demographics, depression/anxiety, CVD risk factors, health behaviors, and, additionally, a history of childhood abuse.\r\nResults: Over 60% of the sample had at least one traumatic exposure, and 18% had three or more exposures. A greater number of traumatic exposures was associated with lower FMD, indicating poorer endothelial function in multivariable models (beta, \u03b2 [standard error, SE] \u22121.05 [0.40], P = 0.01). Relations between trauma exposure and FMD were particularly pronounced for three or more trauma exposures (b [SE] \u22121.90 [0.71], P = 0.008, relative to no exposures, multivariable).\r\nConclusions: A greater number of traumatic exposures were associated with poorer endothelial function.

Aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus, and Salmonella were used to determine contamination at four different slaughter stages, namely, dehiding, evisceration, splitting, and dispatch. Microbiological criteria of the four microorganisms were used to score contamination levels (CLs) as poor (0), poor to average (1), average (2), or good (3). MCLPs were further assigned to carcasses, personnel, and equipment at each stage by summing up the CL scores. The CL score attributed to aerobic plate count contamination was 2 or 3 for carcasses but 0 for personnel and equipment in almost all slaughterhouses. A score of 0 on carcasses was mostly attributed to Enterobacteriaceae at evisceration and to Salmonella at dehiding and evisceration. In addition, a score of 0 was mostly attributed to Staphylococcus contamination of personnel at dehiding. A score of 3 was attributed mostly to Enterobacteriaceae on hands at splitting, whereas a score of 2 was mostly attributed to the clothes at dehiding and evisceration. A CL score of 3 was mostly attributed to Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella contamination of equipment at dehiding and splitting, respectively. Although CLs attributed to contamination of carcasses, personnel, and equipment ranged from 0 to 3, the maximum MCLP score of 9 was only attained in carcasses from two slaughterhouses at dehiding and from one slaughterhouse at dispatch. There is, therefore, a lot of room for small and medium enterprise slaughterhouses to improve their food safety objectives by improving food safety management systems at the points characterized by low CL scores.",

Antifibrinolytic therapy is known to reduce recurrent bleeding, however, its beneficial effect on outcome remains unclear. The effect of treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA) until aneurysm treatment on clinical outcome is evaluated.\r\nMethods\r\nPatients with an aSAH from two high-volume tertiary referral treatment centers in the Netherlands, Academic Medical Center (AMC) and Radboud University Medical Center (RUMC), between January 2012 and December 2015 were included.

Demographic and clinical characteristics, in-hospital complications and clinical outcome were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for the influence of treatment center and baseline differences.\r\nResults\r\nStandard treatment was given in 509 patients, and 119 patients received additional TXA therapy before aneurysm occlusion. Patients treated with TXA did not experience less recurrent bleeding adjusted or unadjusted for treatment center (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.37\u20131.73).

Contextual riskiness was diagnosed as low, moderate or high. FSMS activities were diagnosed as absent, basic, average or advanced. FS output was diagnosed as not performed, poor, moderate or good. Four clusters with significantly different (p < 0.05) context riskiness, FSMS activities, and FS output, were identified. Cluster I and II had average context riskiness while cluster III and IV had moderate to high risk. Cluster I had advanced FSMS activities (score 2) while Cluster IV had basic activities. Cluster I had the best food safety output (score 2) while Cluster IV had the most basic activities. Cluster I largely comprised of large scale dairies with FS programs, Cluster II medium scale with FS programs, Cluster III medium scale without FS programs, and Cluster IV small scale dairies without FS programs. The small-scale dairies showed the least performance in validation activities. Medium scale dairies with existing FSMS programs performed least in CCP analysis, extent use of feedback information verification, documentation, and record keeping activities while small and medium scale SME performed poorly in nearly all the FSMS activities apart from the adequacy of physical intervention equipment. In conclusion, small sized dairies are likely to lack an FS program, which increases their contextual risk and therefore their inability to have good performing FSMS or guarantee high microbial safety output of dairy products.",

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development takes a rather unambitious approach to financial inclusion (FI). It recognizes its importance in advancing several sustainable development goals (SDGs), but it does not include it as a stand-alone goal. This paper criticizes this approach and claims that the new agenda has been a missed opportunity to focus efforts on finding ways of meeting the financial needs of the global poor. We analyse three of the main reasons for not including FI as a sustainable goal: namely, the instrumentality argument, the free market argument, and the veil argument.",

We included multiply injured patients aged between 3 and 60 years of age from a single level I Trauma center. A questionnaire based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for PTSD, including individual symptoms related to intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal was sent to all patients.\r\nRESULTS\r\n359 (56.35%) patients received a questionnaire. Out of these, 337 (93.87%) returned the questionnaire and were included in the study (223 males (66.17%) and 114 females (33.82%)). Mean follow-up was 29.5 \u00b1 8.5 years. Nearly half the study population (47.18%) experienced lasting psychiatric sequelae, such as intrusive recollection (n= 65, 19.28%), avoidance (n= 92, 27.29%), or hyperarousal (n=95, 28.18%) at least monthly. Ten patients (2.96%) fulfilled all DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD. A total of 131 (38.87%) patients reported fair or poor general health status. There was no difference in injury severity in patients with or without PTSD (Injury Severity Score (ISS) 18.33 vs. 20.36, respectively, p = 0.52) or PTSD-related symptoms including intrusion (19.88 vs. 20.32, p=0.74), avoidance (19.99 vs. 20.3, p=0.79) and hyperarousal (19.36 vs. 20.68, p=0.26).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAt least 20 years after injury, no correlation was found between the development of psychiatric complications and the severity of injury.

Based on data from the Second Integrated Household Survey for 2004, we estimate the determinants of the decision to supply labour in the ganyu market and the amount of labour supplied. Our results do not support the conjecture that ganyu is necessarily a low-return strategy that confines subsistence constrained households to a vicious circle of poverty. However, we do find evidence that ganyu is used as an ex-post coping strategy in the event of shocks, and as an ex-ante social insurance mechanism. Moreover, we generally find a positive reaction of ganyu supply to an increase in the ganyu wages, and no evidence of any backward bending segment of the supply curve for households close to the subsistence level. While ganyu does not appear to drive poor households into further destitution, these households do seem to suffer the most when they face demand side constraints in times of greatest needs.",

However, World Bank and IMF programs differ in design and impact. Thus, the question arises whether the participation in dif-ferent types of World Bank and IMF programs also has a different impact on democratization in recipient coun-tries. Therefore, this paper analyzes empirically the separate and joint effects of World Bank and IMF programs on democratization in 76 developing countries in Africa and Asia from 1974 to 2007. Our results show that aid modalities matter. In general, while World Bank and IMF programs do not change electoral accountability mechanisms in recipient countries, they induce changes in civil liberties and domestic oversight of the borrower government. Traditional lending types have significant negative short-term effects on the extent of horizontal accountability and civil liberties in recipient countries, while more flexible policy lending types significantly increase the extent of checks and balances at the domestic level in the long term. Moreover, civil society\u2019s par-ticipation in the formulation and implementation of national poverty reduction strategies potentially increases a country\u2019s civil liberties record.",

        "document": "Title: The transformation of political cleavages in swiss metropolitan areas\nAbstract: The rural-urban cleavage is becoming less significant to understand politics in Switzerland. The increasing urbanisation and metropolitanization in mind, the aim of this paper is to explore the existence and the relevance of cleavages within Swiss metropolitan areas. We do this on the basis of the analyses of structural and political change in seven metropolitan areas. These include a typology of communes as well as bi-variate and multi-level regression analyses of electoral turnout and voter cleavage scores on four major political cleavages. The results suggest the existence of politically relevant territorial cleavages within the metropolitan areas under scrutiny. Whilst the core cities tend towards a position characterised by left vote and cultural openness, affinities of poor and middle class communes tend to be with the political right and cultural demarcation, whereas affluent and low density communes tend to combine right vote with cultural openness. In addition, the results suggest that the cleavages within metropolitan areas have transformed over the last 30 years. This echoes findings by other authors who have argued that a cultural dimension between openness and demarcation has been added to the socio-economic dimension of political cleavages in Switzerland.",

The flock was investigated because a variety of clinical problems, such as weight loss, poor weight gain, reduced fertility, pneumonia, central nervous disease and death, had occured in the previous 12 months. A diagnosis of visna was made in a sheep referred to the clinic. Subsequently, all adult sheep in the flock were blood sampled for serological testing for maedi-visna. Six ewes were seropositive and were slaughtered together with their lambs. Two of the sero-positive sheep had cli-nical signs of pneumonia with marked dyspnoea, which on post mortem examination revealed broncho-interstitial pneumonia, characteristic of maedi-visna. The results of all of the clinico-pathological findings suggested, strongly, that maedi-visna was the cause of the problem. For control, it was recommended that all adult sheep be tested at six monthly intervals for two years and seropositive animals and their offspring slaughtered. In addition, all sheep one year of age which die should be autopsied.",

There is a pressing need to identify effective CPTSD interventions.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where participants were likely to have clinically significant baseline levels of one or more CPTSD symptom clusters (affect dysregulation, negative self-concept and/or disturbed relationships). We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and PILOTS databases (January 2018), and examined study and outcome quality.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Fifty-one RCTs met inclusion criteria. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), exposure alone (EA) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) were superior to usual care for PTSD symptoms, with effects ranging from g = -0.90 (CBT; k = 27, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.68; moderate quality) to g = -1.26 (EMDR; k = 4, 95% CI -2.01 to -0.51; low quality). CBT and EA each had moderate-large or large effects on negative self-concept, but only one trial of EMDR provided useable data. CBT, EA and EMDR each had moderate or moderate-large effects on disturbed relationships. Few RCTs reported affect dysregulation data. The benefits of all interventions were smaller when compared with non-specific interventions (e.g. befriending). Multivariate meta-regression suggested childhood-onset trauma was associated with a poorer outcome.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The development of effective interventions for CPTSD can build upon the success of PTSD interventions. Further research should assess the benefits of flexibility in intervention selection, sequencing and delivery, based on clinical need and patient preferences.",

        "document": "Title: Progression and risk factors of pododermatitis in part-time group housed rabbit does in Switzerland\nAbstract: In rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.), pododermatitis is a chronic multifactorial skin disease that appears mainly on the plantar surface of the hind legs. This presumably progressive disease can cause pain leading to poor welfare, yet the progression of this disease has not been thoroughly assessed on the level of individual animals. The aim of this longitudinal study thus was to investigate the possible risk factors and the progression of pododermatitis in group housed breeding does in Switzerland on litter and plastic slats.Three commercial rabbit farms with part-time group housing on litter and plastic slats were visited every four weeks throughout one year. During every visit, the same 201 adult female breeding rabbits (67 does per farm) were evaluated for the presence and severity of pododermatitis. Additionally, the does\u2019 age, parity, body weight, reproductive state, hybrid, claw length, cleanliness and moisture of the paws and the temperature and humidity inside the barns were recorded as potential risk factors. The risk factors were analysed through general linear models and additive Bayesian network (ABN) modelling using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for visualising associations between potential risk factors. The progression of pododermatitis was analysed with a transition matrix. Relative humidity inside the barns, body weight, number of kindlings, age, and claw length were the most important risk factors, all being positively associated with pododermatitis. In contrast to expectations, the cleanliness of the left hind paw was negatively associated with the occurrence of pododermatitis, but the effect was small. In young does, the severity of pododermatitis quickly increased and in some rabbits proceeded to ulcerated spots. It was shown that 60.00%, 14.17% and 3.33% of ulcerated lesions recovered to a state without ulceration within 4, 8 or >12 weeks, respectively.",

While it is accepted that Fascin-1 expression correlates with poor clinical outcome and decreased survival in various carcinomas, its role in sarcoma such as osteosarcoma (OS) remains unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the prognostic value and biological relevance of Fascin-1 in OS.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nThe correlation between Fascin-1 expression and the outcome of OS patients was determined by immunohistochemistry analysis of Fascin-1 expression in a tissue microarray of OS tissue specimens collected during primary tumor resection. To examine the effect of Fascin-1, shRNA and overexpression technology to alter Fascin-1 levels in OS cells were used in cellular assays as well as in intratibial xenograft OS models in SCID mice.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nKaplan-Meier survival analysis of Fascin-1 expression in OS tumor specimens revealed a direct relationship between Fascin-1 expression and poor patient survival. Furthermore, overexpression of Fascin-1 in OS cells significantly increased their migratory capacity as well as the activity of the matrix metalloprotease MMP-9, known to be critical for the execution of metastasis. Finally, using relevant xenograft mouse models, orthotopic intratibial transplantation of two different OS cell lines overexpressing Fascin-1 promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nCollectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that Fascin-1 has considerable potential as a novel prognostic biomarker in OS, and suggest that targeting of Fascin-1 might be a new anti-metastatic strategy in OS patient treatment.",

Although treatment in cases of early diagnosis results in a 5-yr survival rate of nearly 60%, the prognosis for patients with secondary lesions at diagnosis is poor, and their 5-yr survival rate remains below 30%. In the present work, we have used a number of analytical methods to investigate the impact of increased metastatic potential on the biophysical properties and force generation of osteosarcoma cells. With that aim, we used two paired osteosarcoma cell lines, with each one comprising a parental line with low metastatic potential and its experimentally selected, highly metastatic form. Mechanical characterization was performed by means of atomic force microscopy, tensile biaxial deformation, and real-time deformability, and cell traction was measured using two-dimensional and micropost-based traction force microscopy. Our results reveal that the low metastatic osteosarcoma cells display larger spreading sizes and generate higher forces than the experimentally selected, highly malignant variants. In turn, the outcome of cell stiffness measurements strongly depends on the method used and the state of the probed cell, indicating that only a set of phenotyping methods provides the full picture of cell mechanics.",

We sought to shed light on this open clinical question. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study on real-life patients with melanoma and active brain metastases treated with combination BRAF/MEK inhibitors. A total of 65 patients were included (38 men and 27 women; median age: 49 years). Of them, 53 patients received dabrafenib/trametinib, 10 received vemurafenib/cobimetinib, one received encorafenib/binimetinib, and one received vemurafenib/trametinib. We did not observe any unexpected treatment-related safety signals in our cohort. Overall, 17 patients continued on therapy through the cutoff date. After initiation of therapy, steroid dose could be decreased in 22 of 33 patients (11 tapered off entirely), anticonvulsants were stopped in four of 21, and narcotics were stopped in four of 12. Median progression-free survival from the start of therapy was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval: 3.6-6.1), and median overall survival was 9.5 months (95% confidence interval: 7.7-13.5). A total of 20 patients were surviving at the cutoff date. Univariate analysis of age, sex, ulceration status, thickness, stage, location, or lactate dehydrogenase did not reveal significant predictors of progression-free survival or overall survival within our cohort, but multivariate analysis suggested that older age, lower risk location of original lesion, and nodular melanoma are poor prognostic indicators. Combination therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors is a viable treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma and brain metastases, but further studies should help to define the optimal treatment approach in this population.",

How has this sudden increase in development resources affected the two major multilateral development banks (MDBs) in the region, the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB)? One might expect that the MDBs would compete with China to maintain influence in Africa. This study uses statistical tests and interviews with government officials in three recipient countries to see if this is the case. The results indicate that total MDB finance by country change little over time in response to Chinese activity. The sectoral allocation of concessional lending to the poorer countries does not show any responsiveness either. In contrast, shifts in levels and sector allocation can be observed for non-concessional countries. Overall, the study suggests that while China\u2019s role in African development finance is indeed substantial and growing, it has not had the \u201cgame changing\u201d impact on traditional development finance as popular perception might lead one to believe. This may change, however, once more recipient countries develop economically and move to non-concessional lending.",

A Roadmap for an Evidence-Based Answer\nAbstract: Two seemingly associated demographic trends have generated considerable interest: income stagnation and rising premature mortality from suicides, drug poisoning, and alcoholic liver disease among US non-Hispanic Whites with low education. Economists interpret these population-level trends to indicate that despair induced by financial stressors is a shared pathway to these causes of death. Although we now have the catchy term \"deaths of despair,\" we have yet to study its central empirical claim: that conceptually defined and empirically assessed \"despair\" is indeed a common pathway to several causes of death. At the level of the person, despair consists of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and biological domains. Despair can also permeate social relationships, networks, institutions, and communities. Extant longitudinal data sets feature repeated measures of despair-before, during, and after the Great Recession-offering resources to test the role that despair induced by economic decline plays in premature morbidity and mortality. Such tests must also focus on protective factors that could shield individuals.  is more than a phrase; it constitutes a hypothesis that deserves conceptual mapping and empirical study with longitudinal, multilevel data.",

However, new surgical techniques and implants have been developed that address these challenges and show improvement in overall patient outcomes. This review addresses general considerations including nonsurgical and surgical treatments of fractures as well as treatment of specific fragility fractures of the extremities. Based on these findings, this chapter gives treatment recommendations for a selection of common geriatric fractures. The aim of treating fragility fractures is on the early mobilization to prevent complications such as pneumonia.

Lack of ASF in diets can result in developmental disorders including stunting, anemia, poor cognitive and motor development. ASF are more effective in preventing stunting than other foods and promoting ASF consumption in low- and middle-income countries could help improve health, particularly among pregnant women and young children. Production and consumption of ASF are, however, also associated with potential food safety risks. Strengthening of food control systems, informed by quantitative assessments of the disease burden associated with ASF is necessary to meet global nutrition goals. We present the human disease burden associated with 13 pathogens (bacteria and parasites) in ASF, based on an analysis of global burden of foodborne disease (FBD) estimates of the WHO Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG). The FBD burden of these pathogens was combined with estimates of the proportion of disease transmitted by eight main groups of ASF. Uncertainty in all estimates was accounted for by Monte Carlo simulation. In 2010, the global burden of ASF was 168 (95% uncertainty interval (UI 137-219) Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 population, which is approximately 35% of the estimated total burden of FBD. Main pathogens contributing to this burden included non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, Taenia solium, and Campylobacter spp. The proportion of FBD burden associated with ASF varied considerably between subregions and between countries within subregions. Likewise, the contribution of different pathogens and ASF groups varied strongly between subregions. Pathogens with a localized distribution included T. solium and fishborne trematodes. Pathogens with a global distribution included non-typhoidal S. enterica, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Mycobacterium bovis. Control methods exist for many hazards associated with ASF, and their implementation is linked to economic development and effective food safety systems.",

Because a German version does not currently exist, this study's aim was to translate the MAP and assess reliability and construct validity of the new version. Therefore, a cross-cultural adaptation was performed following international guidelines. Forty-eight patients with IM completed the German-MAP, twice within two weeks. They were also assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF36), Manual Muscle Test (MMT8), Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT) and Functional Index (FI-2). For discriminant validity, 48 age-and gender-matched healthy controls completed the German-MAP. Reliability was assessed using weighted kappa (Kw). Correlations between the MAP and the HAQ, the physical (PCM) and mental (MCS) component scores of SF36 and the MMT8 and QMT muscle tests were assessed using Spearman correlation analysis. Discriminative validity was assessed by calculating the Area under the Curve (AUC). The German-MAP showed substantial reliability for the four subscales (Kw: 0.65-0.71) and moderate to substantial reliability for the single items (Kw: 0.57-0.77). The MAP showed good construct validity (high correlations with HAQ and PCM, moderate with FI-2, QMT and MMT8 and poor with MCS and pain) and acceptable discrimination for three subscales and two single items (AUC: 0.65-0.79). In conclusion, the German-MAP appears to be a reliable and valid questionnaire to assess ADL-limitations in patients with IM. Further research is required, both to substantiate these results and to evaluate responsiveness.",

Protective immunity against Candida and Aspergillus depends on a highly coordinated interaction between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Genetic and immunological defects in components of these networks result in increased risk of invasive fungal infections among patients undergoing chemotherapy or transplant recipients. We review the most important genetic and immunological factors that influence human susceptibility to Candida and Aspergillus infections and discuss the potential role of basic research to promote precision medicine for infectious diseases. We discuss how immunogenetic studies can help to provide tools for improved identification of high-risk patients and the development of tailored antifungal therapies.",

We find a large negative effect of unfavorable entry conditions on starting wages and a sizable negative long-run effect. Our preferred estimates imply a decrease in starting wages by about 0.9 % and a lifetime loss in wages of about 1.3 % for an increase in the initial local unemployment rate by one percentage point. We show that poor entry conditions are associated with lower quality of a worker's first employer and that the quality of workers' first employer explains as much as three-quarters of the observed long-run wage effects resulting from poor entry conditions. Moreover, wage effects are much more persistent for blue-collar workers because some of them appear to be permanently locked in into low-paying jobs/tasks.",

The merits of a shift from ex-ante conditionality to process conditionality implied by the link of HIPC debt relief to the elaboration of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) remain equally unclear. However, the change from the initial to the Enhanced HIPC-Initiative can easily be explained as a result of utility maximization behavior by national and international bureaucrats, politicians and NGO. A politico-economic model suggests that the overall rise of HIPC default risk and the symbolic value of the year 2000 have been the two major determinants of the policy shift.",

Hardly any evidence exists for younger ages, for continental European and particularly German-speaking countries and based on multidimensional measures of isolation. This study therefore aimed to examine prevalence rates and associations of social isolation with various health conditions and behaviors in the entire Swiss population and across different age groups.\r\nMETHODS\r\nNationally representative cross-sectional data from the Swiss Health Survey collected in 2012 were used and analyzed. The study sample covered 21,597 randomly selected adolescents and adults living in Switzerland and aged 15 and older. A multifactorial five-item social integration index was used to assess social disconnectedness and perceived isolation.\r\nRESULTS\r\nSocial isolation has been found to steadily increase with age and almost consistently to be strongly associated with poor health conditions and unfavorable behaviors across all ages. Nearly a quarter of the general population could be categorized as either only partly integrated or even poorly integrated and largely isolated. The socially isolated people independent of their age showed strongly elevated relative risks of poor self-rated health (aOR = 4.0), musculoskeletal disorders (aOR = 2.8), moderate to severe depression (aOR = 11.5), and multiple health problems (aOR = 5.0). They were also found to be at comparably high risk of behaving unhealthy with regard to physical inactivity (aOR = 2.2), poor diet (aOR = 1.9) and use of psychotropic medications (aOR = 3.6). Although prevalence rates of poor health conditions and behaviors differed greatly between the studied age groups, strong associations and clear dose-response relationships have been found separately for all age groups and particularly for the youngest. A fairly weak or no association at all (depending on the age group) with the degree of social integration was observed only for daily smoking.\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nSocial isolation may be less prevalent at younger ages, but is then even more strongly associated with poor health conditions and behaviors than at older ages.",

This question is analysed on the basis of the exceptionally rich data set provided by the Programme d\u2019analyse des syst\u00e8mes \u00e9ducatifs des pays de la CONFEMEN (PASEC), standardised and comparable for Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Madagascar and Senegal. Within the analysis of the determinants of education quality, particular attention is paid to the situation of different social groups (poor/non-poor, boys/girls). It turns out that poor children are disadvantaged with respect to their learning possibilities because they have a particularly high probability of the absence of certain factors, which are important for the learning of all children. These factors include the availability of books, the parents\u2019 literacy, access to radio and television, the possibility of studying at home, and the availability of meals on a regular basis. As to the distinction between boys and girls, it seems that each group benefits from a teacher of the same sex. If it is intended to target the efforts of education policy on girls, more women will thus have to be encouraged to become teachers.\r\nA further question dealt with is the possible trade off between enrolment (quantity) and the quality of education. No support for this hypothesis emerges from the econometric analysis. On the contrary, it seems that current numbers of students enrolled in a single class \u2014 though often quite high \u2014 still leaves room for more pupils without significant losses in their learning achievement. In the African countries analysed, one could therefore satisfy the demand for education by a higher number of children without fear of a marked reduction in learning quality.\r\nIn sum, it becomes clear that there are multiple options to enhance the efficiency of primary school spending. The level of spending with respect to GDP has a significant impact on the pupils\u2019 learning achievements, but at least as important as the amount of resources available is the way these resources are used.",

We focus on managerial changes within football organizations and analyze dismissals from the top European leagues. To account for the mean reversion of performance, we create a control group of non-dismissals using the nearest neighbor approach. To account for boards' misperceptions, we differentiate between dismissals and non-dismissals that occur either due to poor playing performance on the pitch or due to a sequence of bad luck, which is measured using \"expected goals\". We find that dismissals after poor playing performance on the pitch increase subsequent performance, while dismissals after a series of bad luck do not. Our results have important implications regarding the design of future turnover studies and the costs of boards' ineffective turnover decisions.",

Pre- and postoperative cerebral MRI was acquired in term born neonates with CHD undergoing neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Brain volumes were measured using an atlas prior-based automated method. One-year neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed with the Bayley-III. CHD infants (n\u2009=\u200977) had lower pre- and postoperative total and regional brain volumes compared to controls (n\u2009=\u200944, all p\u2009<\u20090.01).

Larger total and selected regional postoperative brain volumes were found to be associated with better cognitive and language outcomes (all p\u2009<\u20090.04) at one year. This association was independent of length of intensive care unit stay for total, cortical, temporal, frontal and cerebellar volumes.

First, organization studies researchers have traditionally been good at importing ideas from other areas of research but poor at exporting their own ideas to other fields. Second, even within the field of organization studies, interest in organizations has decreased over the past decades as organization scholars have turned away from organizations to address such other phenomena as institutions or networks. Both developments are undermining the significance of organization studies as a distinctive field of research, the insights of which are necessary for understanding modern society. In this essay, we elaborate on recent suggestions by distinctively European scholars for strengthening concern for the particularities of organization in social theorizing. The first suggestion is to move decisions back to the core of the field. The second suggestion is to extend the notion of organization beyond organizations. We illustrate these two moves with examples from the literature and discuss implications for the future of organization studies.",

Current knowledge on incidence, pathophysiology and natural history of HF in cardiomyopathies is limited, and distinct features of their therapeutic responses have not been systematically addressed. Therefore, this position paper focuses on epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history and latest developments in treatment of HF in patients with dilated (DCM), hypertrophic (HCM) and restrictive (RCM) cardiomyopathies. In DCM, HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has high incidence and prevalence and represents the most frequent cause of death, despite improvements in treatment. In addition, advanced HF in DCM is one of the leading indications for heart transplantation. In HCM, HF with preserved ejection (HFpEF) affects most patients with obstructive, and \u223c10% of patients with non-obstructive HCM. A timely treatment is important, since development of advanced HF, although rare in HCM, portends a poor prognosis. In RCM, HFpEF is common, while HFrEF occurs later and more frequently in amyloidosis or iron overload/haemochromatosis. Irrespective of RCM aetiology, HF is a harbinger of a poor outcome. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of HF in cardiomyopathies have significant implications for therapeutic decision-making. In addition, new aetiology-specific treatment options (e.g. enzyme replacement therapy, transthyretin stabilizers, immunoadsorption, immunotherapy, etc.) have shown a potential to improve outcomes. Still, causative therapies of many cardiomyopathies are lacking, highlighting the need for the development of effective strategies to prevent and treat HF in cardiomyopathies.",

Very preterm born infants born below 32 weeks gestation are at highest risk because their immune system is not yet adapted to ex-utero life, providing intensive care frequently compromises their skin or mucosa and they require a long duration of hospital stay. An epidemiological overview is difficult to provide because there is no mutually accepted definition available for either LOS or NEC. LOS incidence proportions are generally reported based on identified blood culture pathogens. However, discordance in minimum day of onset and whether coagulase negative staphylococci or fungi should be included into the reported proportions lead to variation in reported incidences. Complicating the comparison are the absence of biomarkers, ancillary lab tests or prediction models with sufficiently high positive and/or negative predictive values. The only high negative predictive values result from negative blood culture results with negative lab results allowing to discontinue antibiotic treatment. Similar difficulties exist in reporting and diagnosing NEC. Although most publications base their proportions on a modified version of Bell's stage 2 or 3, comparisons are made difficult by the multifactorial nature of the disease reflecting several pathways to intestinal necrosis, the absence of a reliable biomarker and the unclear differentiation from spontaneous intestinal perforations. Comparable reports in very low birthweight infants range between 5% and 30% for LOS and 1.6% to 7.1% for NEC. Evidence based guidelines to support treatment are missing. Treatment for LOS remains largely empirical and focused mainly on antibiotics. In the absence of a clear diagnosis, even unspecific early warning signals need to be met with antibiotic treatment. Cessation after negative blood culture is difficult unless the child was asymptomatic from the beginning. As a result, antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed medications, but unnecessary exposure may result in increased risk for mortality, NEC, further infections and childhood obesity or asthma. Finding ways to limit antibiotic use are thus important and have shown a large potential for improvement of care and limitation of cost. Over recent decades, none of the attempts to establish novel therapies have succeeded. LOS and NEC proportions remained mostly stable. During the past 10 years however, publications emerged reporting a reduction, sometimes by almost 50%. Most concern units participating in a surveillance system using quality improvement strategies to prevent LOS or NEC (e.g., hand hygiene, evidence based \"bundles\", feeding onset, providing own mother's milk). We conclude that these approaches display a potential for wider spread reduction of LOS and NEC and for a subsequently more successful development of novel therapies as these often address the same pathways as the prevention strategies.",

In this study, we set out to discover Antibody responses (AR) with prognostic impact in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) stratified by HPV-status. Experimental Design: A fluorescent bead-based multiplex serology assay to 29 cancer antigens (16 cancer-testis antigens, 5 cancer-retina antigens, 8 oncogenes) and 29 HPV-antigens was performed in samples of 362 HNSCC patients from five independent cohorts (153 HPV-positive, 209 HPV-negative). A multivariable cox proportional hazard model with bootstrapping (M=1000) was used for validation of prognostic antibody responses. Results: AR to any of the cancer antigens were found in 257/362 patients (71%). In HPV-negative patients, antibody responses to to c-myc, MAGE-A1, -A4 and Rhodopsin E2 (combined as ARhigh risk) were significantly associated with shorter overall survival. In HPV-positive patients antibody responses to IMP-1 were discovered as a negative prognostic factor. ARhigh risk (HR=1.76) and antibody responses to IMP-1 (HR=3.28) were confirmed as independent markers for a poor prognosis in a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model with bootstrapping (M=1000). Conclusion: We identified AR to cancer antigens that associate with a dismal prognosis in HNSCC patients beyond HPV-positive-status. ARhigh risk may be used to detect HPV-negative patients with an extraordinarily bad prognosis. Most importantly, AR to IMP-1 may serve as a marker for a subgroup of HPV-positive patients that present with a poor prognosis similar to that in HPV-negative patients.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of PEPs with respect to age, stimulation site, and skin type.  METHODS  Electroencephalographic responses evoked by two pinprick stimulation intensities (128\u2009mN and 256\u2009mN) applied at three sites (hand dorsum, palmar digit II, and foot dorsum) were recorded in 30 healthy individuals. Test-retest reliability was performed for the vertex negative-positive complex amplitudes, N-latencies, and pain ratings evoked by the 256mN stimulation intensity.  RESULTS  Feasibility of PEP acquisition was demonstrated across age groups, with higher proportions of evoked potentials (>85%) for the 256mN stimulation intensity. Reliability analyses, that is, Bland-Altman and intraclass correlation coefficients, revealed poor to excellent reliability upon retest depending on the stimulation sites.  CONCLUSIONS  This study highlights the reliability of PEP acquisition from cervical and lumbar segments across clinically representative age groups. Future methodological improvements might further strengthen PEP reliability in order to complement clinical neurophysiology of sensory nerve fibers by a more specific assessment of mechano-nociceptive pathways. Beyond looking at sensory deficits, PEPs may also become applicable to revealing signs of central sensitization, complementing the clinical assessment of mechanical hyperalgesia.",

Such support can be mutual; however, the influential factors in giving and receiving are unclear. This study investigated neighborhood help among the older European population using representative data for 17 countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The analyses were based on 104,059 observations of 39,113 respondents aged 50 years and older. In general, ~6% of all respondents provided recently neighborhood help, and 4% received help. Moreover, the results indicate a high degree of reciprocity in giving and receiving neighborhood help. However, the situation varied widely among age groups and countries. Our multilevel results suggest that the provision and receipt of help are driven by personal characteristics (age, sex, education, income, and retirement), health resources (subjective health, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living), living situation (homeownership, location, and length of time in a residence), social factors (marital status, partner, parents, and children), and contextual factors (gross domestic product, social expenditures, poverty rate, Gini index, population density, country-centered satisfaction with life, living, and relationships).",

        "document": "Title: The link between mental health and safe drinking water behaviors in a vulnerable population in rural Malawi\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Mental disorders, particularly depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are common long-term psychological outcomes in emergency contexts arising from conflicts, natural disasters, and other challenging environmental conditions. In emergencies, people suffer not only from the lack of external resources such as drinking water and food but also from poor mental health. Mental disorders can substantially impair daily activities in vulnerable individuals. However, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) behaviors are daily activities that require effort, time, and strong internal motivation. Therefore, questions arise: whether there is a relationship between mental health and safe water behaviors, and if so, whether the motivational drivers of these behaviors are affected by mental health.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Our cross-sectional study conducted face-to-face interviews with 638 households in rural Malawi. We used a quantitative questionnaire based on the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities, and self-regulation (RANAS) approach to measure motivational psychosocial factors. Mental health was assessed using the validated Chichewa version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20).\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Almost a third of the respondents reported poor mental health. We found significant negative association between mental health and self-reported safe water collection (p\u2009=\u2009.01, r\u2009=\u2009-.104) but not between safe water transportation and storage behavior. The moderation analysis revealed significant interaction effects of mental health with some psychosocial factors and therefore on WASH behaviors. Poor mental health changed the influence of three psychosocial factors-perceived others' behavior, commitment, and remembering-on safe drinking water collection behavior. The influence on water transportation and storage behavior of the perceived severity of contracting a disease, the belief that transporting and storing water requires substantial effort, and others' approval depended on the mental health condition of the respondent.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: These results imply that populations with a significant proportion of individuals with poor mental health will benefit from interventions to mitigate mental health before or parallel to behavioral change interventions for WASH. Specific population-level interventions have been shown to have a positive effect on mental well-being, and they have been successfully applied at scale. This research is especially relevant in emergency contexts, as it indicates that mental health measures before any WASH interventions will make them more effective.",

A recent consensus conference elaborated recommendations and key issues for future studies, among those the use of pan\u2010cytokeratin stains, especially in stage II patients. We report the first prospective diagnostic experience using pan\u2010cytokeratin for tumour budding assessment. Moreover, we evaluate tumour budding using pan\u2010cytokeratin stains and disease\u2010free survival (DFS) in stage II patients. To this end, tumour budding on pan\u2010cytokeratin\u2010stained sections was evaluated by counting the number of tumour buds in 10 high\u2010power fields (0.238 mm2), then categorizing counts as low/high\u2010grade at a cut\u2010off of 10 buds, in two cohorts. Cohort 1: prospective setting with 236 unselected primary resected colorectal cancers analysed by 17 pathologists during diagnostic routine. Cohort 2: retrospective cohort of 150 stage II patients with information on DFS. In prospective analysis of cohort 1, tumour budding counts correlated with advanced pT, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion (all p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and distant metastasis (p\u2009=\u20090.0128). In cohort 2, tumour budding was an independent predictor of worse DFS using counts [p\u2009=\u20090.037, HR (95% CI): 1.007 (1.0\u20131.014)] and the low\u2010grade/high\u2010grade scoring approach [p\u2009=\u20090.02; HR (95% CI): 3.04 (1.2\u20137.77), 90.7 versus 73%, respectively]. In conclusion, tumour budding assessed on pan\u2010cytokeratin slides is feasible in a large pathology institute and leads to expected associations with clinicopathological features. Additionally, it is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in stage II patients and should be considered for risk stratification in future clinical studies.",

We previously identified the novel gene Metastasis Associated in Colon Cancer 1 (MACC1) in CRC and demonstrated its importance as metastasis inducer and prognostic biomarker. Here, we investigate the geographic expression pattern of MACC1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma and tumor buds in correlation with clinicopathological and molecular features for improvement of survival prognosis.\r\nMETHODS: We performed geographic MACC1 expression analysis in tumor center, invasive front and tumor buds on whole tissue sections of 187 well-characterized CRCs by immunohistochemistry. MACC1 expression in each geographic zone was analyzed with Mismatch repair (MMR)-status, BRAF/KRAS-mutations and CpG-island methylation.\r\nRESULTS: MACC1 was significantly overexpressed in tumor tissue as compared to normal mucosa (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Within colorectal adenocarcinomas, a significant increase of MACC1 from tumor center to front (p\u2009=\u20090.0012) was detected. MACC1 was highly overexpressed in 55% tumor budding cells. Independent of geographic location, MACC1 predicted advanced pT and pN-stages, high grade tumor budding, venous and lymphatic invasion (p\u2009<\u20090.05). High MACC1 expression at the invasive front was decisive for prediction of metastasis (p\u2009=\u20090.0223) and poor survival (p\u2009=\u20090.0217). The geographic pattern of MACC1 did not correlate with MMR-status, BRAF/KRAS-mutations or CpG-island methylation.\r\nCONCLUSION:  MACC1 is differentially expressed in CRC. At the invasive front, MACC1 expression predicts best aggressive clinicopathological features, tumor budding, metastasis formation and poor survival outcome",

In these patients, we measured the perfusion quality of the pelvic floor with contrast media kinetics in the preoperative MRI of the prostate and compared the levator ani muscle (region of interest) to the surrounding pelvic muscle structures (reference). Prospectively collected questionnaires regarding urinary incontinence were then evaluated 1\u00a0year postoperatively. Outcomes were dichotomized into \"continent\" (ICIQ-Score\u2009=\u20090-5) and \"incontinent\" (ICIQ-Score\u2009\u2265\u20096). In each patient, we determined the perfusion ratio of the levator ani muscle divided by the surrounding pelvic muscle structures and compared them among the groups.\r\nRESULTS  Forty-two patients were included in the study (n\u2009=\u200922 in \"continent\", n\u2009=\u200920 in \"incontinent\" group).

If such additions do not affect the coefficient of interest (much), a study is presumed to be reliable. We caution that such invariance may result from the fact that the observed variables used in such robustness checks are often poor measures of the potential underlying confounders. In this case, a more powerful test of the identifying assumption is to put the variable on the left-hand side of the candidate regression. We provide derivations for the estimators and test statistics involved, as well as power calculations, which can help applied researchers interpret their findings. We illustrate these results in the context of estimating the returns to schooling.",

Here we evaluate the association of abnormal body mass index and weight change with outcome in patients with brain metastasis.\r\nMETHODS\r\nPatients with a diagnosis of brain metastasis treated at the University Hospital Zurich (n\u2009=\u2009703) were assessed for associations of body mass index, weight change, comorbidities and survival.\r\nRESULTS\r\nCompared with patients with normal body mass index of 18.5-24.9\u00a0kg/m and a median overall survival of 9\u00a0months (95% confidence interval 7.5-10.5), overall survival was inferior in patients with body mass index\u2009<\u200918.5\u00a0kg/m (overall survival 6\u00a0months, 95% confidence interval 1.6-10.3, p\u2009=\u20090.04), but superior in patients with body mass index\u2009>\u200925\u00a0kg/m (overall survival 13\u00a0months, 95% confidence interval 11.0-15.0; p\u2009=\u20090.033). We report a median relative weight loss of 5% within the first 6\u00a0months of diagnosis of brain metastasis (95% confidence interval 3.3-6.5), and reduction exceeding the median was associated with an unfavorable outcome (weight loss\u2009<\u20095% 22.0\u00a0months, 95% confidence interval 19.2-24.8; weight loss\u2009>\u20095% 14.0\u00a0months, 95% confidence interval 11.9-16.).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nHigh body mass index is associated with better, and underweight with worse outcome in patients with brain metastasis. Conversely, weight loss above median may predict poor outcome. Future studies need to address whether vigorous treatment of tumor cachexia, e.g. by specific nutrition management, might improve outcome of patients with brain metastasis. In contrast, regimens associated with weight loss such as ketogenic diet may be detrimental.",

We retrospectively studied 245 patients receiving allo-HCT2 as a salvage treatment for relapse following allo-HCT1 between the 2000 and 2017. The median age at allo-HCT2 was 34\u00b76\u00a0years (range: 18-74). One hundred and one patients (41%) received sibling donor and 144 (59%) unrelated donor allo-HCT2. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and III-IV occurred in 33% and 17% of the patients, respectively. The incidence of 2-year total and extensive chronic GVHD was 38% and 19%, respectively. The 2- and 5-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality, relapse incidence, leukaemia-free survival, overall survival and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 24% and 26%, 56% and 62%, 20% and 12%, 30% and 14% and 12% & 7%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with overall survival were age, time from allo-HCT1 to relapse, conditioning for allo-HCT1, Karnofsky score at allo-HCT2 and donor type for allo-HCT2. In conclusion, outcomes of allo-HCT2 in ALL patients were poor, with only 14% overall survival and 7% GRFS at 5\u00a0years with very high relapse incidence.",

Little is known about whether parental incarceration during childhood is associated with adult psychiatric problems and functional outcomes.\r\n\r\nObjective: To examine whether parental incarceration is associated with increased levels of psychiatric diagnosis and poor outcomes in health, legal, financial, and social domains in adulthood.\r\n\r\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the community-representative, prospective, longitudinal Great Smoky Mountains Study. Children and their parents were interviewed up to 8 times from January 1993 to December 2000 (ages 9-16 years; 6674 observations of 1420 participants) using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, which assessed parental incarceration, childhood psychiatric diagnoses, and other adversities. Young adults were followed up at ages 19, 21, 25, and 30 years from January 1999 to December 2015 (4556 observations of 1334 participants) to assess psychiatric diagnoses and functional outcomes indicative of a disrupted transition to adulthood. Data analysis was conducted from June 2018 to June 2019.\r\n\r\nResults: By age 16 years, 475 participants (weighted percentage, 23.9%) had a parental figure who had been incarcerated, including 259 young men (22.2%) and 216 young women (25.5%). Parental incarceration was associated with higher prevalence of childhood psychiatric diagnoses (eg, any depressive diagnosis: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.6; P\u2009=\u2009.006; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: aOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0-5.5; P\u2009=\u2009.06; and conduct disorder: aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.3; P\u2009=\u2009.001). After accounting for childhood psychiatric diagnoses and adversity exposure, parental incarceration remained associated with increased odds of having an adult anxiety disorder (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-3.0; P\u2009=\u2009.04), having an illicit drug use disorder (aOR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2.6-17.0; P\u2009<\u2009.001), having a felony charge (aOR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.8-6.5; P\u2009<\u2009.001), incarceration (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.4-5.4; P\u2009=\u2009.003), not completing high school (aOR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.2-8.8; P\u2009<\u2009.001), early parenthood (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-3.0; P\u2009=\u2009.04), and being socially isolated (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0; P\u2009=\u2009.009).\r\n\r\nConclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that parental incarceration is associated with a broad range of psychiatric, legal, financial, and social outcomes during young adulthood. Parental incarceration is a common experience that may perpetuate disadvantage from generation to generation.",

We compared patients who received AD medication at discharge with those who did not, with regard to baseline characteristics and outcomes in 1-year follow-ups using logistic regression. Outcome endpoints included mortality, re-hospitalisation, cerebrovascular events, re-infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft as well as pacemaker and/or cardioverter-defibrillator implantations. Additionally, work and daily life conditions were compared between the groups.\r\nRESULTS  Among 8911 AMI patients, 565 (6.3%) received AD at discharge. These patients were predominantly female, older, experienced more often non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, were in higher Killip classes, and had more frequently hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, obesity and comorbidities. They underwent less frequently PCI, and stayed in hospital longer. The AD-receiving group had higher crude all-cause mortality at 1-year follow-up than the non-receiving group (7.4% vs 3.4%; p\u202f<\u202f.001) and AD prescription was an independent predictor for mortality (OR 1.67; CI: 1.17 to 2.40).\r\nCONCLUSION  AD medication at discharge was associated with poorer prognosis in AMI patients at 1-year follow-up. However, this study has limited data on depression diagnosis and drug classes. Further research is needed to pinpoint the causes and underlying pathomechanisms for the higher mortality observed in this patient group.",

We aimed to assess which determinants make the largest contribution to these inequalities.\r\nMETHODS\r\nWe did an international comparative study of inequalities in risk factors for shorter life expectancy in Europe. We collected register-based mortality data and survey-based risk factor data from 15 European countries. We calculated partial life expectancies between the ages of 35 years and 80 years by education and gender and determined the effect on mortality of changing the prevalence of eight risk factors-father with a manual occupation, low income, few social contacts, smoking, high alcohol consumption, high bodyweight, low physical exercise, and low fruit and vegetable consumption-among people with a low level of education to that among people with a high level of education (upward levelling scenario), using population attributable fractions.\r\nFINDINGS\r\nIn all countries, a substantial gap existed in partial life expectancy between people with low and high levels of education, of 2\u00b73-8\u00b72 years among men and 0\u00b76-4\u00b75 years among women. The risk factors contributing most to the gap in life expectancy were smoking (19\u00b78% among men and 18\u00b79% among women), low income (9\u00b77% and 13\u00b74%), and high bodyweight (7\u00b77% and 11\u00b77%), but large differences existed between countries in the contribution of risk factors. Sensitivity analyses using the prevalence of risk factors in the most favourable country (best practice scenario) showed that the potential for reducing the gap might be considerably smaller. The results were also sensitive to varying assumptions about the mortality risks associated with each risk factor.\r\nINTERPRETATION\r\nSmoking, low income, and high bodyweight are quantitatively important entry points for policies to reduce educational inequalities in life expectancy in most European countries, but priorities differ between countries. A substantial reduction of inequalities in life expectancy requires policy actions on a broad range of health determinants.\r\nFUNDING\r\nEuropean Commission and Network for Studies on Pensions, Aging, and Retirement.",

        "document": "Title: Can personality traits and intelligence compensate for background disadvantage? Predicting status attainment in adulthood.\nAbstract: This study investigated the interplay of family background and individual differences, such as personality traits and intelligence (measured in a large U.S. representative sample of high school students; N = 81,000) in predicting educational attainment, annual income, and occupational prestige 11 years later. Specifically, we tested whether individual differences followed 1 of 3 patterns in relation to parental socioeconomic status (SES) when predicting attained status: (a) the independent effects hypothesis (i.e., individual differences predict attainments independent of parental SES level), (b) the resource substitution hypothesis (i.e., individual differences are stronger predictors of attainments at lower levels of parental SES), and (c) the Matthew effect hypothesis (i.e., \u201cthe rich get richer\u201d; individual differences are stronger predictors of attainments at higher levels of parental SES). We found that personality traits and intelligence in adolescence predicted later attained status above and beyond parental SES. A standard deviation increase in individual differences translated to up to 8 additional months of education, $4,233 annually, and more prestigious occupations. Furthermore, although we did find some evidence for both the resource substitution and the Matthew effect hypotheses, the most robust pattern across all models supported the independent effects hypothesis. Intelligence was the exception, the interaction models being more robust. Finally, we found that although personality traits may help compensate for background disadvantage to a small extent, they do not usually lead to a \u201cfull catch-up\u201d effect, unlike intelligence. This was the first longitudinal study of status attainment to test interactive models of individual differences and background factors.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of modified Cormack-Lehane (MCL) views and to elucidate variables for poor views in a large collective of children without anticipated airway difficulties.\r\nMETHODS: The departmental anaesthesia patient database was searched for patients who had undergone general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation between January 2007 and March 2017. Inclusion criteria were age from birth to 17.99 years, general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy, no history, symptoms or signs of a difficult airway and the best obtained MCL view documented in the database. Patient- and anaesthesia-related variables associated with a poor view (MCL IIb, III and IV) were elucidated using a logistic regression model.\r\nRESULTS: In all, 22\u00a0965 patients were included; of these, 17\u00a0593 were observed only once. The prevalence of the first observed MCL views I, IIa, IIb, III and IV was 90.6%, 8.5%, 0.86%, 0.05% and 0%, respectively. The logistic regression model indicates that age and gender are the most important variables associated with MCL views IIb and III in the model. The probability for MCL views IIb/III decreases across the first 5-7 years before increasing again.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The incidence of a poor grade of laryngoscopic view was found to be very low in children with a normal airway. They mainly occurred in infants and adolescent patients and were more common in male patients.",

The article delves into a qualitative case study of a nationwide vocational skills training project called the Employment Fund Nepal and two Swiss development agencies that are involved in its planning and implementation. In this project, economically poor members of various groups (including Dalits), who are discriminated based on social categories such as caste or ethnicity, are subsumed under the category 'Disadvantaged Groups' and treated as priority target groups. Academic literature shows that targeting based on social categories can unintentionally foster these categories and risks ignoring intra-group inequalities. Our research indicates that these pitfalls of affirmative action might also emerge in the Employment Fund. Nevertheless, the case study suggests that the breadth of the Disadvantaged Groups category also facilitates inclusivity and emphasizes commonalities, and might prevent an enforced division along traditional social boundaries. We assume that the inclusion of Dalits into broad categories such as Disadvantaged Groups reduces their traditional stigmatisation. Still, we argue that certain Dalit-specific livelihood realities should be given extra attention within development projects and that affirmative action measures need to be highly contextualized and flexibly implemented.",

However, one contributor to the lack of progress that may be modifiable is poor clinical trial accrual. Surveys of brain tumor patients and neuro-oncology providers suggest that clinicians do a poor job of discussing clinical trials with patients and referring patients for clinical trials. Yet, data from the Cancer Action Network of the American Cancer Society suggest that most eligible oncology patients asked to enroll on a clinical trial will agree to do so. To this end, the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) in collaboration with the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group, patient advocacy groups, clinical trial cooperative groups including the Adult Brain Tumor Consortium (ABTC), and other partners are working together with the intent to double clinical trial accrual over the next five years.

The aim of the present investigation was to describe clinical findings, short- and long-term outcomes, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in Pugs with thoracolumbar SAD.\r\nANIMALS: Twenty-five client owned Pugs with 12-month follow-up information after surgical treatment of thoracolumbar SAD.\r\nMETHODS: Multicenter retrospective case series. All medical records were searched for Pugs diagnosed with SAD. Data regarding signalment, history, surgical procedure, outcome, histopathology, and follow-up MRI results were extracted.\r\nRESULTS: Mean age at presentation was 7.32 (range 2-11) years, 80% were males. Short-term outcome was available in 25 dogs, and improvement was confirmed in 80% of dogs. Long-term outcome was available in 21 dogs, and deterioration was confirmed in 86% of cases, with late-onset recurrence of clinical signs after initial postsurgical improvement affecting 85% of Pugs. A moderate correlation (r\u2009=\u20090.50) was found between duration of clinical signs and outcome.

The Likert score for suspicion of cancer assigned by the primary radiologist was extracted from the original report, and histopathologic work-up of the biopsy cores served as the reference standard. Two readers assessed the amount of changes on T2-weighted sequences and assigned a predefined prostate signal-intensity homogeneity score of 1-5 (1 = poor, extensive changes; 5 = excellent, no changes). The sensitivity and specificity of Likert scores for detection of prostate cancer and clinically significant cancer (Gleason score \u2265 3+4) were estimated in and compared between subgroups of patients with different signal-intensity homogeneity scores (\u2264 2, 3, and \u2265 4).\r\nRESULTS\r\nInterreader agreement on signal-intensity homogeneity scores was substantial (\u03ba = 0.783). Sensitivity for prostate cancer detection increased when scores were better (i.e., higher) (reader 1, from 0.41 to 0.71; reader 2, from 0.53 to 0.73; p \u2264 0.007, both readers). In the detection of significant cancer (Gleason score \u2265 3+4), sensitivity also increased with higher signal-intensity scores (reader 1, from 0.50 to 0.82; reader 2, from 0.63 to 0.86; p \u2264 0.028), though specificity decreased significantly for one reader (from 0.67 to 0.38; p = 0.009).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBackground signal-intensity changes on T2-weighted images significantly limit prostate cancer detection. The proposed scoring system could improve the standardization of prostate MRI reporting and provide guidance for applying prostate MRI results appropriately in clinical decision-making.",

One explanation for this relative underperformance of histological grading is that current criteria to distinguish World Health Organization (WHO) grade III anaplastic astrocytomas from lower-grade diffuse astrocytomas (WHO grade II) are vague (\"increased mitotic activity\"). This qualitative approach ensures diagnostic uncertainty and a broad \"gray zone\" where both diffuse and anaplastic designations can reasonably be assigned. Thus, we hypothesized that interobserver variability and lack of defined mitotic thresholds for IDH-mutant astrocytomas underlies poor predictive accuracy of current histologic grading approaches. To test this hypothesis, we quantified total mitotic figures and maximum mitotic activity per 10 high-powered fields in an institutional cohort of IDH-mutant astrocytomas. In our cohort, there was no mitotic activity threshold that was reflective of progression-free or overall survival (OS). Furthermore, in a multivariate Cox regression model consisting of mitotic activity, molecular markers, and clinical characteristics, only CDKN2A homozygous deletion was identified as a relevant variant for poor OS. We conclude that lack of defined mitotic figure thresholds may not contribute to underperformance of histological grading for IDH-mutant astrocytomas.",

Such preferential activation appears in the N1 event-related potential (ERP) over the occipitotemporal scalp after around 150-250 ms and the corresponding blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the ventral occipitotemporal (vOT) cortex. Here, orthography-sensitive (print vs. false font) processing was examined using simultaneous EEG-fMRI in 38 first grade children with poor and typical reading skills, and at varying familial risk for developmental dyslexia. Coarse orthographic sensitivity was observed as an increased activation to print in the N1 ERP and in the BOLD signal of individually varying vOT regions in 57% of beginning readers. Finer differentiation in processing orthographic strings (words vs nonwords) further occurred in specific vOT clusters. Neither method alone showed robust differences in orthography-sensitive processing between typical and poor reading children. Importantly, using single-trial N1 ERP-informed fMRI analysis, we found differential modulation of the BOLD response in the left vOT to print vs false font strings for typical reading children only. This result thus confirms subtle functional alterations in a brain structure known to be critical for fluent reading at the very beginning of reading instruction.",

However, simply stacking more layers of the popular Transformer architecture for machine translation results in poor convergence and high computational overhead. Our empirical analysis suggests that convergence is poor due to gradient vanishing caused by the interaction between residual connection and layer normalization. We propose depth-scaled initialization (DS-Init), which decreases parameter variance at the initialization stage, and reduces output variance of residual connections so as to ease gradient back-propagation through normalization layers. To address computational cost, we propose a merged attention sublayer (MAtt) which combines a simplified average-based self-attention sublayer and the encoder-decoder attention sublayer on the decoder side. Results on WMT and IWSLT translation tasks with five translation directions show that deep Transformers with DS-Init and MAtt can substantially outperform their base counterpart in terms of BLEU (+1.1 BLEU on average for 12-layer models), while matching the decoding speed of the baseline model thanks to the efficiency improvements of MAtt.",

        "document": "Title: Rethinking interhemispheric imbalance as a target for stroke neurorehabilitation\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\r\nPatients with chronic stroke have been shown to have failure to release interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from the intact to the damaged hemisphere before movement execution (premovement IHI). This inhibitory imbalance was found to correlate with poor motor performance in the chronic stage after stroke and has since become a target for therapeutic interventions. The logic of this approach, however, implies that abnormal premovement IHI is causal to poor behavioral outcome and should therefore be present early after stroke when motor impairment is at its worst. To test this idea, in a longitudinal study, we investigated interhemispheric interactions by tracking patients' premovement IHI for one\u2009year following stroke.\r\nMETHODS\r\nWe assessed premovement IHI and motor behavior five times over a 1-year period after ischemic stroke in 22 patients and 11 healthy participants.\r\nRESULTS\r\nWe found that premovement IHI was normal during the acute/subacute period and only became abnormal at the chronic stage; specifically, release of IHI in movement preparation worsened as motor behavior improved. In addition, premovement IHI did not correlate with behavioral measures cross-sectionally, whereas the longitudinal emergence of abnormal premovement IHI from the acute to the chronic stage was inversely correlated with recovery of finger individuation.\r\nINTERPRETATION\r\nThese results suggest that interhemispheric imbalance is not a cause of poor motor recovery, but instead might be the consequence of underlying recovery processes. These findings call into question the rehabilitation strategy of attempting to rebalance interhemispheric interactions in order to improve motor recovery after stroke. Ann Neurol 2019;85:502-513.",

Famine took hold after a blight <jats:italic>(Phytophthora infestans)</jats:italic> destroyed virtually the only means of subsistence\u2014the potato crop\u2014for a significant proportion of the population. This study seeks to elucidate the variability of diet in mid\u201319th-century Ireland through microparticle and proteomic analysis of human dental calculus samples (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 42) from victims of the famine. The samples derive from remains of people who died between August 1847 and March 1851 while receiving poor relief as inmates in the union workhouse in the city of Kilkenny (52\u00b039\u2032 N, \u22127\u00b015\u2032 W). The results corroborate the historical accounts of food provisions before and during the famine, with evidence of corn (maize), potato, and cereal starch granules from the microparticle analysis and milk protein from the proteomic analysis. Unexpectedly, there is also evidence of egg protein\u2014a food source generally reserved only for export and the better-off social classes\u2014which highlights the variability of the prefamine experience for those who died. Through historical contextualization, this study shows how the notoriously monotonous potato diet of the poor was opportunistically supplemented by other foodstuffs. While the Great Irish Famine was one of the worst subsistence crises in history, it was foremost a social disaster induced by the lack of access to food and not the lack of food availability.",

The exact causes of death in these patients are unknown.\r\nMETHODS: \r\nWe performed a retrospective study of all consecutive patients with SAH with World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade IV or V on admission from 2009 to 2013 at 2 tertiary referral centers in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada, who had died during their hospital stay.\r\nRESULTS: \r\nOf 357 patients, 152 (43%) had died. Of these 152 patients, 87 (24%) had not undergone aneurysm treatment. The median interval to death was 3 days (interquartile range, 1-12 days) after initial hemorrhage. The major cause of death in both centers was withdrawal of life support (107 patients [71%]; 74 of 94 [79%] in Amsterdam and 33 of 58 [58%] in Toronto; P < 0.01), followed by brain death in 23 (15%; 16 of 58 [28%] in Amsterdam vs. 7 of 94 [7%] in Toronto; P < 0.01). The remaining causes of death represented <15%.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: \r\nThe decision to withdraw life support was the major reason for death of patients with poor-grade SAH for an overwhelming majority of the patients. The exact reasons for withdrawal of life support, other than cultural and referral differences, were undetermined. Insight into the reasons of death should be prospectively studied to improve the care and clinical outcomes of patients with poor-grade SAH.\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Paradoxically, the use of successful treatments for chronic heart failure can prolong life but\u2014per definition\u2014causes the rise in age of patients experiencing acute decompensations, since nothing at the moment helps avoiding an acute or final stage in the elderly population. To complicate the picture, acute heart failure syndromes are a collection of symptoms, signs and markers, with different aetiologies and different courses, also due to overlapping morbidities and to the plethora of chronic medications. The palette of cardio- and vasoactive drugs used in the hospitalization phase to stabilize the patient\u2019s hemodynamic is scarce and even scarcer is the evidence for the agents commonly used in the practice (e.g. catecholamines). The pipeline in this field is poor and the clinical development chronically unsuccessful. Recent set backs in expected clinical trials for new agents in acute heart failure (AHF) (omecamtiv, serelaxine, ularitide) left a field desolately empty, where only few drugs have been approved for clinical use, for example, levosimendan and nesiritide. In this consensus opinion paper, experts from 26 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K. and Ukraine) analyse the situation in details also by help of artificial intelligence applied to bibliographic searches, try to distil some lesson-learned to avoid that future projects would make the same mistakes as in the past and recommend how to lead a successful development project in this field in dire need of new agents.",

Based on fieldwork in the Palestinian city of Nablus (2013\u20132014) where institutional channels for distributing zakat had become blocked due to security crackdowns in 2008, this article analyses direct zakat practices where givers and receivers confront one another in face-to-face interaction.

Against this background, direct zakat manifested itself as discreet gestures of \u2018covering\u2019 need, while people\u00a0not asking openly\u00a0for support tended to be praised for their shyness and piety.

More detailed dissection of MRD response heterogeneity and the specific genetic aberrations could improve current practice.\r\n\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\r\n\r\nMRD was assessed after induction treatment and at different times during relapse treatment until allo-HSCT (indicated in poor responders to induction; MRD \u2265 10$^{-3}$) for patients being treated for late BCP-ALL bone marrow relapses (n = 413; median follow-up, 9.4 years) in the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 trial/registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00114348).\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nPatients with both good (MRD < 10$^{-3}$) and poor responses to induction treatment reached excellent event-free survival (EFS; 72% v 65%) and overall survival (OS; 82% v 74%). Patients with MRD of 10$^{-2}$ or greater after induction had reduced EFS (56%), and their MRD persisted until allo-HSCT more frequently than it did in patients with MRD of 10$^{-3}$ or greater to less than 10$^{-2}$ (P = .037). Patients with 25% or more leukemic blasts after induction (early nonresponders) had the poorest prognosis (EFS, 22%). Interestingly, patients with MRD of 10$^{-3}$ or greater before allo-HSCT (late nonresponders) still had an EFS of 50% and OS of 63%, which in principle justifies allo-HSCT in these patients. From a panel of selected candidate genes, TP53 alterations (frequency, 8%) were the only genetic alteration with independent prognostic value in any MRD-based response subgroup.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAfter induction treatment, MRD-based treatment stratification resulted in excellent survival in patients with late relapsed BCP-ALL. Prognosis could be further improved in very poor responders by intensifying treatment directly after induction. TP53 alterations can be defined as a novel genetic high-risk marker in all MRD response groups in late relapsed BCP-ALL. Here we identified early and late nonresponders to be considered as events in future trials.",

Herein we retrospectively review 51 cats with unresectable, histologically confirmed oral SCC and a complete initial staging work-up: cats in group A (n = 24) received medical anti-angiogenic treatment consisting of bleomycin, piroxicam and thalidomide, cats in group B (n = 27) received the anti-angiogenic treatment and concurrent accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy with 48Gy delivered in 10 fractions. Overall median progression-free interval (PFI) was poor with 70\u2009days (95% CI: 48;93). In the irradiated cats (group B), however, PFI was significantly longer with 179\u2009days (95% CI: 58;301) days, vs 30\u2009days (95% CI: 23;38) in medically only treated cats (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Overall median overall survival (OS) was 89\u2009days (95% CI: 55;124), again significantly longer in the irradiated cats (group B) with 136 (95% CI: 40;233) vs 38\u2009days (95% CI: 23;54) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). In 8 of the 27 (29.6%) cats in group B, however, severe toxicity (grade 3) occurred. Neither onset nor severity of toxicity could be associated with any of the tested variables, including anatomic site, tumour size, clinical stage and duration of neoadjuvant medical treatment. Given the potential severe acute effects and the impact on quality of life after chemo-radiotherapy, owners must be clearly informed about the risks of treatment. With the overall poor outcome and high occurrence of acute toxicity, we cannot recommend the use of this accelerated radiation protocol combined with anti-angiogenic therapy for oral SCC in cats.",

Treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMA) was introduced between 2004 and 2006 but its impact on population-based survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiological characteristics and survival before and after introduction of HMA treatment.\r\nMethods\r\nWe performed a population-based analysis of CMML cases reported to the Cantonal Cancer Registries in Switzerland (SWISS) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from the United States for 1999\u20132006 (before HMA) and 2007\u20132014 (after HMA). Time trends were compared for these two time periods.\r\nResults\r\n423 and 4144 new CMML cases were reported to the SWISS and SEER registries, respectively. We observed an increasing proportion of older patients \u226575 years in the SWISS (50.3%\u201362.3%) compared to a decreasing one in the SEER population (59.1%\u201355.1%). Age standardized incidence-rates were similar and remained stable in both countries (0.32\u20130.38 per 100\u2019000 py). Relative survival (RS) improved significantly in the SEER (3 years 27%\u201337%; 5 years 19%\u201323%; p\u2009<\u20090.001 for both) but remained stable in the SWISS population (3 years 48% to 40%; 5 years 34% to 26%; n.s. for both).\r\nConclusions\r\nWith the exception of opposing age-trends, epidemiologic characteristics are similar in both countries and comparable to other population-based registries. RS remains poor and different time trends of population-based survival cannot be faithfully explained by HMA but most likely by changes in diagnostic accuracy within prognostically distinct age-groups.",

For aminoglycosides, however, correlations between resistance pathways inferred on the basis of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) clinical breakpoints and expert rules versus genotypes are generally poor. This study aimed at developing and validating a decision tree based on resistance phenotypes determined by disc diffusion and based on epidemiological cut-offs (ECOFFs) to infer the corresponding resistance mechanisms in Escherichia coli.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nPhenotypic antibiotic susceptibility of thirty wild-type and 458 aminoglycoside-resistant E. coli clinical isolates was determined by disc diffusion and the genomes were sequenced. Based on well-defined cut-offs, we developed a phenotype-based algorithm (Aminoglycoside Resistance Mechanism Inference Algorithm - ARMIA) to infer the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the corresponding aminoglycoside resistance phenotypes. The mechanisms inferred from susceptibility to kanamycin, tobramycin and gentamicin were analysed using ARMIA- or EUCAST-based AST interpretation and validated by whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the host bacteria.\r\n\r\nFINDINGS\r\n\r\nARMIA-based inference of resistance mechanisms and WGS data were congruent in 441/458 isolates (96\u00b73%). In contrast, there was a poor correlation between resistance mechanisms inferred using EUCAST CBPs/expert rules and WGS data (418/488, 85\u00b76%). Based on the assumption that resistance mechanisms can result in therapeutic failure, EUCAST produced 63 (12\u00b79%) very major errors (vME), compared to only 2 (0\u00b74%) vME with ARMIA. When used for detection and identification of resistance mechanisms, ARMIA resolved >95% vMEs generated by EUCAST-based AST interpretation.\r\n\r\nINTERPRETATION\r\n\r\nThis study demonstrates that ECOFF-based analysis of AST data of only four aminoglycosides provides accurate information on the resistance mechanisms in E. coli. Since aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms, despite having in certain cases a minimal effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, may compromise the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides, prompt detection of resistance mechanisms is crucial for therapy. Using ARMIA as an interpretative rule set for editing AST results allows for better predictions of in vivo activity of this drug class.",

A prospective diagnostic study\nAbstract: BACKGROUND:\r\nDiagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in primary care (PC) is challenging and associated with a considerable diagnostic delay. Using a calprotectin test for any PC patient with abdominal complaints would cause significant costs. The 8-item-questionnaire CalproQuest was developed to increase the pre-test probability for a positive Calprotectin. It is a feasible instrument to assess IBD in PC, but has not yet been evaluated in clinical routine. This study, therefore, aimed to validate whether the CalproQuest increases pretest-probability for a positive fecal Calprotectin.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nProspective diagnostic trial. The CalproQuest consists of 4 major and 4 minor questions suggestive for IBD. It is considered positive if \u2265 2 major or 1 major and 2 minor criteria are positive. Primary outcome: Sensitivity and specificity of the CalproQuest for Calprotectin levels \u2265 50 \u03bcg/g and for positive IBD diagnosis among patients referred to endoscopic evaluation at secondary care level. Secondary finding: Patient-reported diagnostic delay.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n156 patients from 7 study centers had a complete CalproQuest and fecal Calprotectin test. The sensitivity and specificity of CalproQuest for Calprotectin \u2265 50 \u03bcg/g was 36% and 57%. The sensitivity and specificity of the CalproQuest for positive IBD diagnosis was 37% and 67%. The diagnostic delay was 61 months (SD 125.2).\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nIn this prospective diagnostic study, the sensitivity and specificity of CalproQuest for Calprotectin levels \u2265 50 \u03bcg/g and positive IBD diagnosis were poor. Additional prospective studies concerning the ideal cut-off values, validity and cost-effectiveness of a combined use with the Calprotectin test in the PC setting are necessary.",

Over 150 host susceptibility genes have been described, although most overlap between CD, UC and their subtypes, and they do not adequately account for the overall incidence or the highly variable severity of disease. Replicating key findings between two long-term IBD cohorts, we have defined distinct networks of taxa associations within intestinal biopsies of CD and UC patients. Disturbances in an association network containing taxa of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, typically producing short chain fatty acids, characterize frequently relapsing disease and poor responses to treatment with anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapeutic antibodies. Alterations of taxa within this network also characterize risk of later disease recurrence of patients in remission after the active inflamed segment of CD has been surgically removed.",

Case series indicated that patients suffering from these subtypes have a dismal outcome and may benefit from the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We analyzed clinical characteristics and outcome of 46 ABL-class fusion positive cases other than BCR-ABL1 treated according to AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 and 2009 protocols; 13 of them received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor during different phases of treatment. ABL-class fusion positive cases had a poor early treatment response: minimal residual disease levels of >5x10-4 were observed in 71.4% of patients after induction treatment and in 51.2% after consolidation phase. For the entire cohort of 46 cases the 5-year probability of event-free survival was 49.1+8.9% and that of overall survival 69.6+7.8%; the cumulative incidence of relapse was 25.6+8.2% and treatment-related mortality 20.8+6.8%. One out of 13 cases with tyrosine kinase inhibitor added to chemotherapy relapsed while eight of 33 cases without tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment suffered from relapse, including six in 17 patients who had not received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Stem cell transplantation seems to be effective in preventing relapses (only three relapses in 25 patients), but was associated with a very high treatment-related mortality (6 patients). These data indicate a major need for an early identification of ABL-class fusion positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases and to establish a properly designed, controlled study aimed at investigating the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the appropriate chemotherapy backbone and the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

In the last decade, we have learned that in addition to the endemically and epidemically occurring form of hepatitis E, which is predominantly transmitted by contaminated drinking water, and constitutes a significant health problem in resource-poor countries, there is a globally existing form of hepatitis E, which is a zoonosis, and as such primarily transmitted by the consumption of contaminated meat products. Although in most cases hepatitis E is subclinical or mild and self-limiting, pregnant women and patients with liver cirrhosis may have severe, occasionally even fatal disease, and immunocompromised individuals may develop chronic hepatitis E. Considering the substantial global health burden caused by HEV infection, it is surprising how limited our knowledge of hepatitis E pathology still is. In this paper, we describe localization studies on HEV infection and discuss their implications for everyday diagnostics. Furthermore, we outline and discuss the spectrum of histologic changes, which can be found in HEV infection in various clinical contexts.",

In spite of initial good response to chemotherapy, the prognosis of TNBC remains poor and no effective specific targeted therapy is readily available. Recently, we demonstrated the ability of U94, the latency gene of human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), to interfere with proliferation and with crucial steps of the metastatic cascade by using MDA-MB 231 TNBC breast cancer cell line. U94 expression was also associated with a partial mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) of cells, which displayed a less aggressive phenotype. In this study, we show the ability of U94 to exert its anticancer activity on three different TNBC cell lines by inhibiting DNA damage repair genes, cell cycle and eventually leading to cell death following activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, we found that U94 acted synergistically with DNA-damaging drugs. Overall, we provide evidence that U94 is able to combat tumor cells with different mechanisms, thus attesting for the great potential of this molecule as a multi-target drug in cancer therapy.",

A Phase III, 36 Weeks, Multi-Center, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Randomized Superiority Study\nAbstract: Background: Depressive disorders in childhood and adolescence are a major health problem and often follow a chronic course with severe consequences in later life. Depressive disorders cause the highest burden of disease in this age group across all medical conditions. Treatment adherence is usually very poor, and the use of antidepressant drugs is heavily debated, as suicidal ideations may increase, in particular in the early phase of treatment. Omega-3 fatty acids rich in eicosapentaenoic acid have shown some promising results in over a dozen small scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adult major depressive disorders, with only very few published RCTs in children and adolescents. High-quality phase III RCTs are missing.\r\nMethods and Design: The omega-3-pMDD trial is a carefully designed phase III RCT to assess the efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acids in the early course of pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD). The study is designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial enrolling 220 patients aged 8 to 17 years meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder of at least moderate symptom severity. After a single-blinded placebo-lead-in phase (7 to 10 days) patients are randomly assigned to omega-3 fatty acids or placebo over 36 weeks. Primary outcomes are changes in depression severity, as well as remission and recovery rates. Secondary outcome measures include the omega-3 index and inflammatory parameters as predictors of response. Data analysis will be performed in the intention-to-treat sample using a (generalized) linear random intercept regression model. Through sampling of blood, hair, saliva, and urine, further putative biological markers for depression and omega-3 fatty response will be investigated.\r\nDiscussion: This trial addresses if omega-3 fatty acids play a role in the pathogenesis of pediatric MDDs and have antidepressant properties, in particular in clinically depressed children and adolescents with a pre-existing omega-3 fatty acid deficiency, increased markers of oxidative stress, and/or markers of (low grade) inflammation.\r\nEthics and Dissemination: The study was approved by the local ethics committees. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals irrespective of specific outcomes.\r\nClinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03167307.",

Several reports of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 alterations point to its pathogenic role in the disease. However, the occurrence of treatment resistance to anti-HER2 therapy demand the need for further knowledge. We report of a patient with metastatic penoscrotal extramammary Paget's disease, with an ERBB2$^{S310F}$ mutation, in which near complete response was achieved upon treatment with trastuzumab and carboplatin. However, after 10 cycles of trastuzumab and carboplatin, widespread metastasis re-occurred. Analysis of a newly developing metastasis revealed additional genomic alterations including ERBB3$^{A232V}$ and PIK3CA$^{G106V}$ point mutations as well as MET and CDK6 amplification, providing a potential mechanism of acquired treatment resistance. Therefore, ERBB family inhibitor afatinib was initiated. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to disease-related complications shortly after treatment initiation. This is the first report of ERBB2$^{S310F}$ mutated, metastatic extramammary Paget's disease with secondary resistance to trastuzumab / carboplatin, potentially due to additional acquired genomic alterations. This case contributes to the growing evidence of HER2 in the pathogenesis of metastatic extramammary Paget's disease and emphasizes the importance of repetitive, genomic analysis in rare diseases.",

It is now recognised that intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDCP) has an associated poor prognosis and this is reflected in its histological, molecular and immunohistochemical features. The current recommendation of the World Health Organization is that IDCP not be taken into consideration when grading prostate adenocarcinoma. It is apparent that Gleason did not differentiate between IDCP and stromal invasive carcinoma when developing and validating his grading system, and recent studies suggest that the incorporation of IDCP grading into the overall grading of the specimen provides additional prognostic information.",

Using 0.5\u2009Hz/1.1\u2009Hz/1.6\u2009Hz electrical stimulation (square wave, pulse width:1\u2009ms), current perception thresholds (CPTs), PTs and tolerance thresholds were assessed at two visits. Analyses were performed using linear mixed models, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman method.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nPTs vary in relation to stimulation frequency, location and between genders. PT decreased with higher stimulation frequency. The highest PTs were measured at the BD\u00a0and membranous urethra with males reporting higher PTs than females. Reliability of PT assessments according to ICC was good to excellent across all frequencies, locations, and genders (ICC\u2009=\u20090.61-0.97), except for BD and distal urethra in females showing poor to fair reliability (BD: all frequencies, distal urethra: 0.5\u2009Hz).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nPTs can be safely and reliably assessed from bladder and urethral locations. Semi-objective PT assessment may provide additional information on functionality and sensitivity of the LUT slow fiber afferents and complement findings from urodynamic investigations and CPT assessments. In conclusion, the developed methodology may open new opportunities for using electrical stimulation paradigms for LUT PT assessments and diagnostics. All this allows a more precise, location-specific characterization of pain origin and pain reaction towards therapy.",

It has a metastatic evolution and poor prognosis and is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with 600,000 new cases reported every year. HNSCC heterogeneity and complexity is reflected in a multistep progression, involving crosstalk between several molecular pathways. The Notch pathway is associated with major events supporting cancerogenic evolution: cell proliferation, self-renewal, angiogenesis, and preservation of a pro-oncogenic microenvironment. Additionally, Notch is pivotal in tumor development and plays a dual role acting as both oncogene and tumor suppressor. In this review, we summarize the role of the Notch pathway in HNSCC, with a special focus on its compelling role in major events of tumor initiation and growth.",

However, salvage neck dissection is associated with increased morbidity and may only be necessary in case of persistence of viable tumor cells, which can be difficult to confirm and virtually impossible to exclude by fine needle aspiration cytology. We, therefore, aimed to identify predictive factors for the persistence of viable tumor cells in lymph node metastases from head and neck squamous cell cancer after chemoradiation.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nWe performed a retrospective review of neck dissection specimens performed after primary (chemo\u2010)radiation for oropharyngeal, laryngeal, or hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. All patients were treated at University Hospital Zurich from 2007 to 2016.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nA total of 78 patients were included. Thirty\u2010eight patients (48.7%) had viable tumor cells in their neck dissection sample. High postradiation nodal maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), p16 negativity, and low nodal shrinkage were predictors of viable tumor cells in salvage neck dissections (Mann\u2010Whitney U/chi\u2010squared test, P\u2009<\u2009.001, P = .025, and P = .042, respectively).

The VM involved the synovium of the knee joint in 19 of 26 cases (76%). These lesions were associated with joint effusion (3 of 19; 16%), hemarthrosis (4 of 19; 21%), or synovial thickening (16 of 19; 84%). Follow-up ended 6-8 weeks after the first or second sclerotherapy session if complete pain relief was achieved or 3 months after the third sclerotherapy session. Treatment outcomes were categorized as symptom improvement (complete or partial pain relief) or poor response (unchanged or increased pain).\r\nRESULTS\r\nForty-nine percutaneous sclerotherapy sessions were performed. Despite the absence of signs of knee osteoarthritis, patients with a VM involving the synovium (8 of 14; 57%) showed a poor response to sclerotherapy (1 of 8 [13%] pain-free after 1 sclerotherapy session). Among patients with VMs with no associated joint alteration and no synovial involvement (6 of 14; 43%), 5 of 6 (83%) showed improvement of symptoms after 1 sclerotherapy session (P < .05).\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nJuxta-articular VMs of the knee are frequently associated with hemarthrosis and synovial thickening. Patients with signs of osteoarthritis and synovial involvement of the VM on presclerotherapy MR imaging deserve special consideration, as these findings predict worse clinical symptoms after sclerotherapy.",

Besides survival as a clinical outcome measure, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological distress have become important outcomes in studies investigating the effectiveness of LTx in the short- and long-term.\r\n\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nTo assess and compare HRQoL trajectories of patients after LTx prior to and over a follow-up period of three years post-transplant, and to identify differences regarding distress, HRQoL and patient-related outcomes.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nIn this longitudinal study, 27 lung transplant recipients were prospectively examined for psychological distress (Symptom Checklist short version-9; SCL-K-9), health-related quality of life (EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire; EQ-5D), depression (HADS-Depression scale), and socio-demographic and medical outcomes at two weeks, three months, six months and three years following LTx. Additionally, potential outcome-related predictors for LTx-outcomes at three years post-transplant were assessed. Data were collected in accordance with guidelines set by the STROBE (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology) statement.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nLung transplant recipients showed the most pronounced improvements in HRQoL and reduction in psychological distress between two weeks and three months post-transplant, with relative stable HRQoL and distress trajectories thereafter. The most important predictors of poor somatic health trajectories over time were the pre-transplant disease severity score and the pre-transplant HADS-Depression score. In addition, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pre-transplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-use predicted poorer survival, while cystic fibrosis was associated with better survival three years post-transplant.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nLung transplantation yields significant survival and HRQoL benefits, with its peak improvement at three months post-transplant. The majority of patients can preserve these health changes in the long-term. Patients with a worse HRQoL and higher psychological distress at six months post-transplant tended to have a poorer survival post-transplant. Other risk factors for poorer survival included IPF, pre-transplant ECMO-use, pre-transplant symptoms of depression, high pre-transplant disease severity and worse somatic disease severity trajectories. The majority of LTx-recipients were unable to work due to illness-related reasons.",

In particular, impaired working memory performance has been found in CHD patients of all ages. Working memory is an important domain of higher order cognitive function and is crucial for everyday activities, with emerging importance in adolescence. However, the underlying neural correlate of working memory impairments in CHD is not yet fully understood. Diffusion tensor imaging and tract based spatial statistics analyses were conducted in 47 adolescent survivors of childhood cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (24 females) and in 44 healthy controls (24 females) between 11 and 16 years of age (mean age\u00a0=\u00a013.9, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.6). Fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter diffusion was compared between groups and was correlated with working memory performance, derived from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. CHD patients had significantly poorer working memory compared to controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Widespread bilateral reduction in FA was observed in CHD patients compared to healthy controls (threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) corrected p < 0.05). This reduction in FA was present both in cyanotic and acyanotic CHD patients compared to healthy controls (both p < 0.001). The FA reduction in the frontal lobe, mainly in the forceps minor, was associated with poorer working memory performance in both patients with CHD and healthy controls (TFCE corrected p < 0.05). The current findings underline that in CHD patients, irrespective of disease severity, disrupted or delayed maturation of white matter may persist into adolescence and is associated with working memory impairments, particularly if present in the frontal lobe. Adolescence, which is a crucial period for prefrontal brain maturation, may offer a window of opportunity for intervention in order to support the maturation of frontal brain regions and therefore improve higher order cognitive function in patients with CHD.",

Reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. Here we show that reduced autophagy is a central molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence. Autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphocytes, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in\u00a0vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which is essential for the synthesis of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Spermidine supplementation restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, which can be harnessed to reverse immune senescence in humans.",

        "document": "Title: Genetic and Developmental Factors in Chronic Kidney Disease Hotspots\nAbstract: Chronic kidney disease increasingly is being recognized as an important global public health problem. Interindividual susceptibility to kidney disease is high and likely is dependent on risk modulation through genetics, fetal and early childhood development, environmental circumstances, and comorbidities. Traditionally, the chronic kidney disease burden has been ascribed largely to hypertension and diabetes. Increasingly, evidence is accumulating that nontraditional risk factors may predominate in some regions and populations, contributing to epidemics of kidney disease. Such nontraditional risk factors include environmental exposures, traditional medicines, fetal and maternal factors, infections, kidney stones, and acute kidney injury. Genetic factors may predispose patients to chronic kidney disease in some populations. Chronic kidney disease of unknown origin has its epicenters in Central America and South Asia. Such clustering of CKD may represent either genetic or environmentally driven kidney disease, or combinations of both. Developmental conditions impacting kidney development often are related to poverty and structural factors that persist throughout life. In this article, we explore the possibilities that genetic and developmental factors may be important contributors to the epidemics in these regions and suggest that optimization of factors impacting kidney development hold promise to reduce the risk of kidney disease in future generations.",

IVCR of SwiSCI participants were compared to the normative Swiss population, sampled in the Swiss Health Survey of 2012 using direct standardization, logistic regression standardization, and a genetic matching approach to control for differences in age, sex, and quarterly period of survey response.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nIndividuals with SCI showed higher crude (26%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 22-30%) and age- and sex-standardized (24%, CI: 23-24%) IVCR than observed in the general population (15% CI, 14-15%). The adjustment for age and sex as well as quarterly period of survey response showed that the standardized IVCR of individuals with SCI (17%; CI: 12-23%) approached that of the general population. Low IVCR of about 10% were found among individuals with SCI younger than 45 years. IVCR were similar between men and women and between individuals with incomplete and complete paraplegia and tetraplegia.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe IVCR in individuals with chronic SCI was not higher than in the general population and much lower than guidelines recommend. The improvement of the IVCR is an important target of health policy in SCI in Switzerland as to reduce the evidenced excess burden in respiratory-disease related morbidity and mortality.",

It considers a life-cycle experiment with interest paid on a safe asset and returns on a risky asset that induce a stationary fundamental value. The private savings treatment provides an income stream that terminates at retirement. Observed consumption starts too high and finishes low in later periods. The assisted savings treatment smooths income over all periods, which dampens asset price bubbles and improves consumption profiles. This improvement persists in treatments done without asset trading, but disappears with sharply reduced interest rates that simplify present value considerations.",

Here, we present the junction coverage compatibility score, which provides a way to evaluate the reliability of transcript-level abundance estimates and the accuracy of transcript annotation catalogs. It works by comparing the observed number of reads spanning each annotated splice junction in a genomic region to the predicted number of junction-spanning reads, inferred from the estimated transcript abundances and the genomic coordinates of the corresponding annotated transcripts. We show that although most genes show good agreement between the observed and predicted junction coverages, there is a small set of genes that do not. Genes with poor agreement are found regardless of the method used to estimate transcript abundances, and the corresponding transcript abundances should be treated with care in any downstream analyses.",

However, little is known regarding age-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in PC survivors 5 years or even \u2265 10 years post-diagnosis.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\nThe sample included 1975 disease-free PC survivors (5-16 years post-diagnosis) and 661 cancer-free population controls, recruited from two German population-based studies (CAESAR+, LinDe). HRQoL in both populations was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Additionally, PC survivors completed the PC-specific EORTC QLQ-PR25 questionnaire. Differences in HRQoL between survivors and controls, as well as differences according to age and time since diagnosis were analyzed with multiple regression after adjustment for age, education, stage, and time since diagnosis, where appropriate.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nIn general, PC survivors reported HRQoL and symptom-burden levels comparable to the general population, except for significantly poorer social functioning and higher burden for diarrhea and constipation. In age-specific analyses, PC survivors up to 69 years indicated poorer global health and social functioning than population controls. Stratification by time since diagnosis revealed little difference between the subgroups. On PC-specific symptoms, burden was highest for urinary bother and symptoms, and lowest for bowel symptoms. Younger age was associated with less urinary symptoms but higher urinary bother.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nLong-term disease-free PC survivors reported overall good HRQoL, but experienced persistent specific detriments. Our data suggest that these detriments do not improve substantially with increasing time since diagnosis. Targeted interventions are recommended to prevent PC-related and treatment-related symptoms becoming chronic and to enhance social functioning.",

This study aimed to examine whether baseline neurocognition predicted transition to psychosis, or functional outcomes, at medium-term (mean\u202f=\u202f3.4\u202fyears) follow-up, while controlling for other clinical/treatment variables associated with transition to psychosis.\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\n\r\nAnalysis of data collected as part of a multi-centre RCT of omega-3 fatty acids and cognitive-behavioural case management (NEURAPRO) for UHR individuals was conducted on the 294 participants (134 males, 160 females) who completed neurocognitive assessment (Brief Assessment of Cognition for Schizophrenia) at baseline. Transition to psychosis was determined using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS), and functioning was measured with the Global Functioning: Social and Role Scales.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nMean baseline z-scores indicated that UHR participants performed a quarter to half a standard deviation below normative means in all domains (range mean z\u202f=\u202f-0.24 to -0.47), except for executive functioning (mean z\u202f=\u202f0.16). After adjusting for covariates, poorer Executive (p\u202f=\u202f.010) and Motor (p\u202f=\u202f.030) functions were predictive of transition to psychosis.

The aim of this study was to report the oncological outcome and identify prognostic factors in early-stage glottic squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiotherapy. Material and Methods: Patients (n = 761) diagnosed and treated in 10 centers between 1990 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Probabilities of loco-regional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS) were calculated and possible prognostic factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The median follow-up was 63 months (range: 2-243). Three hundred and sixty-four, 148 and 249 patients had cT1a, cT1b, and cT2 stage I-II disease, respectively. Five and 10-years LRC/OS rates in the whole cohort were 83/82% and 80/68%, respectively. Three patients developed distant recurrences. In univariate analysis, male sex (HR: 3.49; 95% CI: 1.47-11.37; p < 0.01), T2 vs. T1a (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.08-2.43; p = 0.02) and anterior commissure involvement (ACI) (HR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.38-2.45; p < 0.01) were associated with impaired LRC. In multivariate analysis, male sex (HR: 3.42; 95% CI: 1.44-11.17; p < 0.01) and ACI (HR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.01-2.28; p = 0.047) remained poor prognostic factors. No relation of treatment technique and biologically equivalent dose (BED) to oncological outcome was identified except for higher BED10(L = 25; T = 1) yielding better LRC in T1a tumors (p = 0.04) in univariate analyses. Conclusion: Our results highlight the negative impact of ACI on tumor control. A less-expected finding was the impact of sex on tumor control. Further research is needed to validate its prognostic value and investigate any related biologic or behavioral factors, which may be modified to improve oncologic outcome.",

Thus, it is possible to design cities in ways that can reduce poor health and support the well-being of urban residents. Urban design is the framework that gives form and shape to the components of the urban physical environment, including streets, residences, retail outlets, and industrial facilities. In giving form to the urban physical environment an urban design perspective creates an opportunity to shape cities and, in so doing, to shape how cities influence the health of their populations.

The present study examined prevalence rates and associated factors of prolonged grief disorder in this population. 1030 Chinese Shidu parents (381 male, 643 female) who were recruited through convenient sampling completed questionnaires assessing grief severity. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine socio-demographic, loss-related and self-reported number of chronic physical conditions associated with PGD symptoms. Results showed prevalence rate was 35.5% based on the ICD-11 PGD criteria, which was almost twice as that of Prigerson et\u00a0al. (2009) criteria. Younger age of parents, being a mother, living in a rural place, lower monthly income per capital, shorter time since loss and more comorbid chronic physical conditions were related to severer PGD symptoms.

TaqMan Low Density array (TLDA) assay was performed using a set of 20 genes in 92 medulloblastoma samples. The same methodology was assessed in silico using microarray data for 763 medulloblastoma samples from the GSE85217 study, which performed MB classification by a robust integrative method (Transcriptional, Methylation and cytogenetic profile). Furthermore, we validated in 11 MBs samples our proposed method by Methylation Array 450\u2009K to assess methylation profile along with 390\u2009MB samples (GSE109381) and copy number variations. TLDA with only 20 genes accurately assigned MB samples into WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4 using Pearson distance with the average-linkage algorithm and showed concordance with molecular assignment provided by Methylation Array 450\u2009k. Similarly, we tested this simplified set of gene signatures in 763\u2009MB samples and we\u00a0were able to recapitulate molecular assignment with an accuracy of 99.1% (SHH), 94.29% (WNT), 92.36% (Group 3) and 95.40% (Group 4), against 97.31, 97.14, 88.89 and 97.24% (respectively) with the Ward.D2 algorithm. t-SNE analysis revealed a high level of concordance (k\u2009=\u20094) with minor overlapping features between Group 3 and Group 4. Finally, we condensed the number of genes to 6 without significantly losing accuracy in classifying samples into SHH, WNT and non-SHH/non-WNT subgroups. Additionally, we found a relatively high frequency of WNT subgroup in our cohort, which requires further epidemiological studies. TLDA is a rapid, simple and cost-effective assay for classifying MB in low/middle income countries. A simplified method using six genes and restricting the final stratification into SHH, WNT and non-SHH/non-WNT appears to be a very interesting approach for rapid clinical decision-making.",

Pestalozzi\u2019s attempts to combine vocational education with a psychological understanding of the human development can also be read as a strategy to bridge the gap which stands for the dominant divide within German (educational) tradition: a notion of utilitarian education versus the aesthetic concept of inward Bildung.",

Incentives change how we inform ourselves and what we believe\nAbstract: Economists often espouse incentives, arguing that expanding choice sets cannot lower welfare. Yet, laws worldwide restrict incentives for many transactions, partly due to an untested concern that incentives cause poor decisions. I show experimentally that incentives skew information gathering and beliefs about what a transaction entails in a way that causally influences the participation decision, as policy makers suspected. A model of costly information acquisition shows this behavior is consistent with rationality, and thus unconcerning from an ex ante welfare economic perspective, but demands consideration under reasonable alternatives. The mechanisms apply in any situation where incentives interact with information acquisition.",

The mean length of follow-up was 9.6\u00a0years (range 3.5-21.8\u00a0years). The overall mean number of surgical procedures/patient was 5.7 (range 2-9.8/patient) with the overall mean number of surgical procedures/patient/year at 0.59 (range 0.22-1.32/patient/year). While open surgery has decreased over the last decade and PCNL has been stable, there seems to be a rise of RIRS during this period. Patients with cystine stones need periodic interventions for stone recurrences despite medical management, with limited data showing the impact on renal function.

Patients completed questionnaires at baseline enquiring about the \"chief complaint\" [neck pain (NP), arm/shoulder pain (AP) or neurological deficits (ND)] and including the Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI); these were completed again at 24\u00a0months postoperatively, along with a rating of \"global treatment outcome\" (on a five-point scale, later dichotomized as \"good\" or \"poor\"). Differences in outcomes between the groups were examined using ANOVA. Multivariable regression analysis examined the effect of the chief pain location on 24-month outcomes, controlling for age, gender, comorbidity, baseline pain and COMI scores.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty-nine consecutive patients were included, with a chief complaint of NP in 31%, AP in 38% and ND in 31%. The chief complaint groups did not differ in relation to their baseline COMI scores or their reductions in score from before surgery to 24\u00a0months after surgery (reduction: NP group, 4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9 points; AP group, 4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7; ND group, 4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9; p\u2009=\u20090.78).

The present study is the first to thoroughly assess the clinical and molecular profiles of UCD patients examined at a single reference center in Argentina.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nForty-nine UCD cases were collected. About half (26/49, 53%) manifested neonatally with classical presentation and had a high mortality (25/26, 96%). Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) was the most common UCD (26 patients). Argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency (ASSD) was detected in 19 cases, while argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD) was diagnosed in 4 cases. Molecular genetic analysis revealed 8 private OTC mutations and two large deletion/duplication events in the OTC gene. Most mutations in the ASS1 and ASL genes were recurrent missense changes, and four alterations were novel. The clinical outcome of our UCD cohort was poor, with an overall mortality of 57% (28/49 cases), and a 28% (6/21) disability rate among the survivors.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nMost patients in our case series showed severe neonatal onset, with high morbidity/mortality. We detected in total 19 mutations, most of them recurrent and of high frequency worldwide. Noteworthy, we highlight the presence of a geographic cluster with high prevalence of a point mutation in the ASS1 gene. This study suggests that these disorders may be more frequent than commonly assumed, and stresses the need for increased awareness amongst health professionals and greater availability of diagnostic tools for accurate identification, early diagnosis, and timely treatment.",

However, studies on the association between personality traits and biomarkers of chronic low-grade inflammation reflecting increased morbidity and mortality risk are sparse; therefore, the aim of this study was to explore this association.\r\n\r\nMethods: A population-based Swiss sample of 2,182 persons (40-82 years, 42% men) completed a comprehensive personality questionnaire (NEO Five-Factor Inventory-Revised). Circulating levels of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and levels of the \u201ccardioprotective\u201d adipo(cyto)kine adiponectin were also determined. Analyses controlled for sociodemographic factors, traditional cardiovascular risk factors and lifetime psychiatric disorders using a validated semi-structured psychiatric interview. The role of gender as a moderator of the personality-inflammation link was additionally explored.\r\n\r\nResults: Controlling for all covariates, higher Extraversion (\u03b2 = 0.092, 95%CI 0.004-0.180) was positively associated with higher IL-6 levels, and higher Conscientiousness (\u03b2 = -0.095, 95%CI -0.180-[-0.009]) were significantly associated with lower IL-6 levels (all p-values < 0.05). Neuroticism and Agreeableness showed no significant association with any inflammatory biomarker. The associations between personality traits and inflammatory markers were not moderated by gender.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Conscientiousness seems to be inversely related to chronic low-grade inflammation as measured by IL-6 levels, compatible with protection from the cardiovascular risk. The opposite may apply to Extraversion. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and their impact for health outcomes in the community.",

        "document": "Title: Lifestyle factors and high-risk atherosclerosis: Pathways and mechanisms beyond traditional risk factors\nAbstract: Despite major efforts to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) burden with conventional risk factor control, significant residual risk remains. Recent evidence on non-traditional determinants of cardiometabolic health has advanced our understanding of lifestyle-disease interactions. Chronic exposure to environmental stressors like poor diet quality, sedentarism, ambient air pollution and noise, sleep deprivation and psychosocial stress affect numerous traditional and non-traditional intermediary pathways related to ASCVD. These include body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength and functionality and the intestinal microbiome, which are increasingly recognized as major determinants of cardiovascular health. Evidence points to partially overlapping mechanisms, including effects on inflammatory and nutrient sensing pathways, endocrine signalling, autonomic function and autophagy. Of particular relevance is the potential of low-risk lifestyle factors to impact on plaque vulnerability through altered adipose tissue and skeletal muscle phenotype and secretome. Collectively, low-risk lifestyle factors cause a set of phenotypic adaptations shifting tissue cross-talk from a proinflammatory milieu conducive for high-risk atherosclerosis to an anti-atherogenic milieu. The ketone body \u00df-hydroxybutyrate, through inhibition of the NLRP-3 inflammasome, is likely to be an intermediary for many of these observed benefits. Adhering to low-risk lifestyle factors adds to the prognostic value of optimal risk factor management, and benefit occurs even when the impact on conventional risk markers is discouragingly minimal or not present. The aims of this review are (a) to discuss novel lifestyle risk factors and their underlying biochemical principles and (b) to provide new perspectives on potentially more feasible recommendations to improve long-term adherence to low-risk lifestyle factors.",

First, a more powerful CEO generally receives more pay and a contract with a higher pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) if firm performance is low. In contrast, if firm performance is high, more CEO power translates into less pay and a lower PPS. Second, considering a special case of our general model, we show that more powerful CEOs receive higher salaries, more stocks but a nonincreasing number of options. Third, we find that the presence of a powerful CEO generally leaves the optimal use of relative performance evaluation unaffected. However, we identify conditions under which the sensitivity of CEO pay to peer performance can be increasing in the CEO's power over the board. Overall, our results suggest that frequently used indicators of poor (or sound) compensation practices should be interpreted with care.",

This system classifies complication severity by the treatment provided. However, it is unclear whether the Clavien-Dindo system can be used internationally in studies across differing healthcare systems in high- (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nThis was a secondary analysis of the International Surgical Outcomes Study (ISOS), a prospective observational cohort study of elective surgery in adults. Data collection occurred over a 7-day period. Severity of complications was graded using Clavien-Dindo and the simpler ISOS grading (mild, moderate or severe, based on guided investigator judgement). Severity grading was compared using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Data are presented as frequencies and ICC values (with 95 per cent c.i.). The analysis was stratified by income status of the country, comparing HICs with LMICs.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nA total of 44 814 patients were recruited from 474 hospitals in 27 countries (19 HICs and 8 LMICs). Some 7508 patients (16\u00b78 per cent) experienced at least one postoperative complication, equivalent to 11 664 complications in total. Using the ISOS classification, 5504 of 11 664 complications (47\u00b72 per cent) were graded as mild, 4244 (36\u00b74 per cent) as moderate and 1916 (16\u00b74 per cent) as severe. Using Clavien-Dindo, 6781 of 11 664 complications (58\u00b71 per cent) were graded as I or II, 1740 (14\u00b79 per cent) as III, 2408 (20\u00b76 per cent) as IV and 735 (6\u00b73 per cent) as V. Agreement between classification systems was poor overall (ICC 0\u00b741, 95 per cent c.i. 0\u00b720 to 0\u00b755), and in LMICs (ICC 0\u00b723, 0\u00b705 to 0\u00b738) and HICs (ICC 0\u00b746, 0\u00b725 to 0\u00b759).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nCaution is recommended when using a treatment approach to grade complications in global surgery studies, as this may introduce bias unintentionally.",

Little is known about treatment and outcome data of relapsed disease (RD).\r\nMETHODS: Characteristics, treatment, and outcome of 155 patients\u00a0\u2264\u00a012 months registered within the Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) between 1981 and 2016 were evaluated.\r\nRESULTS: Localized disease (LD) was diagnosed in 144 patients and metastatic disease (MD) in 11. The histological diagnosis was alveolar (RMA) (n\u00a0=\u00a038, 23/25 examined patients PAX7/3:FOXO1-positive), embryonal (RME) (n\u00a0=\u00a0100), botryoid (n\u00a0=\u00a010), anaplastic (n\u00a0=\u00a01), and spindle-cell RMS (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Multimodal treatment including conventional (age-adjusted) chemotherapy (CHT) (n\u00a0=\u00a0150), resection (n\u00a0=\u00a0137), and radiotherapy (RT) (n\u00a0=\u00a037) was administered. Complete remission was achieved in 129 of 144 patients with LD. RD occurred in 51 infants at a median age of 1.7 years (range, 0.3-8.8). Sixty-three percent of patients with RMA suffered RD, in contrast to 28% of patients with RME. Relapse treatment consisted of conventional CHT (n\u00a0=\u00a048), resection (n\u00a0=\u00a028), and RT (n\u00a0=\u00a021). The pattern of relapse and best resection were significant prognostic factors for patients with RD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Late effects occurred as secondary malignancies in 6%, long-term toxicity in 21%, and resection-related impairment in 33% of the 105 surviving patients. The 5-year event-free survival and overall survival for infants with initial LD were 51% and 69%, 14% and 14% for patients with initial MD and 39% and 41% for relapsed patients, respectively.\r\nCONCLUSION: Multimodal treatment including microscopically complete resection is strongly recommended to achieve a good prognosis in LD and RD of infants with RMS.",

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with an increased risk for the development of brain metastases and the prognosis until recently has been poor except for some patients\u2019 subgroups and depending on the disease-specific GPA prognostic factors [4].\r\n\r\nFor patients receiving only best supportive care, average survival is about 3 months and it is assumed that through additional whole brain radiotherapy average survival may be improved up to 6\u20139 months in selected patients [5].\r\n\r\nIn recent years, complex treatment strategies for different solid tumors have been developed and this has impacted on the general management of brain metastases. Most of the studies on brain metastases have included different histological subtypes and therefore have made tumor- specific recommendations difficult. In this review, we discuss the current evidence on management of brain metastases and incorporate specific recent data on oncogenic-driven NSCLC in order to suggest recommendations on the optimal management of brain metastases in this subgroup of NSCLC where formal level I evidence is lacking.",

We study the selection effects of patronage in the world's most successful navy - the British Royal Navy between 1690 and 1849. Using newly collected data on the battle performance of more than 5,800 naval officers promoted - with and without family ties - to the top of the navy hierarchy, we find that connected promotees outperformed unconnected ones. There was substantial heterogeneity among the admirals in charge of promotions. Discretion over appointments thus created scope for \"good\" and \"bad\" patronage. Because most admirals promoted on the basis of merit and did not favor their kin, the overall selection effect of patronage was positive.",

The day is supposed to be celebrated by raising awareness about issues affecting the elderly and to appreciate the contributions that older people make to society. What is the one thing that most of us today are going to become? \u2013 get older. Populations around the world are rapidly ageing. Ageing presents both challenges and opportunities. Societies that adapt to this changing demographic and invest in Healthy Ageing can enable individuals to live both longer and healthier lives and for societies to reap the dividends. 80% of people over 60 will live in low- and middle-income countries by 2050. In Africa, old age is a social category experienced in relation to other generations, especially to youth while as in Europe old peoples\u2019 homes have been established and more or less accepted as the living arrangement for the elderly. This is however without draw backs. Though moving into a nursing home is an individual experience, people who move into a nursing home experience different types of changes which they feel to a greater or lesser degree as stressful. The change in social status, the impact on autonomy, the feeling of having no place to call home, the change in social contacts, and the reduction of habitual activities rank first in the presentation of the results and endanger the people\u2019s identity which they had before.

Thus, new therapeutic advances are urgently needed. Cabazitaxel has shown preclinical activity in platinum-resistant GCT models. Here, we report the first clinical case series of cabazitaxel treatment for platinum-refractory GCT.\r\nMETHODS: Data of multiply relapsed GCT patients receiving single-agent cabazitaxel were retrospectively analysed. Endpoints included 12-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate, disease control rate, tumour marker responses, median PFS and OS, and toxicity.\r\nRESULTS: Cabazitaxel showed limited activity in 13 heavily pre-treated GCT patients. After a median follow-up of 23\u00a0weeks (IQR 29), 69% of patients were deceased. A median of 2 cycles of cabazitaxel (range 1-7) were applied. The 12-week PFS rate was 31%.

Clinical studies that assessed a measurement property of a walking outcome measure for patients with neurogenic claudication were selected. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Measurement property results were assessed using the adapted criteria from Terwee et al. (2007).\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nTwelve studies that evaluated 15 separate walking outcome measures were included. Out of the 12 studies included, half had poor methodological quality. Four measures had acceptable test-retest reliability: the self-paced walking test (intraclass correlation coefficient, or ICC was 0.98, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99), Physical Function Scale (PFS) (pooled analysis ICC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77-0.89), PFS walk item (ICC = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.89), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) walk item (ICC = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.92). Responsiveness was assessed on five walking outcome measures, and three had adequate responsiveness: the ODI walk item (Area under the Curve, or AUC, was 0.76, SD 0.15), Treadmill test (AUC = 0.70), and PFS (AUC = 0.77, SD 0.14). A meta-analysis demonstrated the PFS had adequate test retest reliability (pooled ICC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77-0.89) and internal consistency (pooled Cronbach's \u03b1lpha (\u03b1) = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.81-0.86), but not criterion validity (pooled correlation coefficient = -0.59, 95% CI: -0.71, -0.45). Measures that recorded adequate criterion validity were the ODI walk item (pooled correlation coefficient = -0.71, 95% CI: -0.80, -0.58), Treadmill test (pooled correlation coefficient = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.91), and self predicted walking item (pooled correlation coefficient = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63-0.82).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe results of our systematic review demonstrated that high-quality studies that asses the measurement properties of walking outcome measures for patients with neurogenic claudication are lacking. There was only limited evidence available for each walking measure, which prevented any single outcome from being confirmed as the gold standard measure of neurogenic claudication. Clinicians and researchers are recommended to use the self-paced walking test and ODI walk item until further evidence is available. Future research should focus on producing high-quality studies with excellent methodology and larger sample sizes.",

The present study aimed to investigate whether different aspects of sleep quality influence intrusive memory development and whether PTSD status moderates this relationship.Participants and Methods: 34 PTSD, 52 trauma-exposed (TE) and 42 non-trauma exposed (NTE) participants completed an emotional memory task, where they viewed 60 images (20 positive, 20 negative and 20 neutral) and, two days later, reported how many intrusive memories they had of each valence category. Participants also completed three measures of sleep quality: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the REM Behaviour Disorder Screening Questionnaire and total hours slept before each session.Results: The PTSD group reported poorer sleep quality than both TE and NTE groups on all three measures, and significantly more negative intrusive memories than the NTE group. Mediation analyses revealed that self-reported RBD symptomology before the second session mediated the relationship between PTSD status and intrusive memories. Follow-up moderation analyses revealed that self-reported RBD symptomology before the second session was only a significant predictor of intrusion in the PTSD group, though with a small effect size.Conclusions: These findings suggest that RBD symptomology is an indicator of consolidation of intrusive memories in PTSD but not trauma-exposed or healthy participants, which supports the relevance of characterising RBD in PTSD.",

Do both these dimensions of being poor capture attention in ways that distort decision-making and trap people in poverty? We examine these issues using real-life shocks faced by farmers in Brazil: random payday variation affecting income levels, and rainfall shocks that affect income uncertainty. We find that it is income uncertainty that systematically has adverse cognitive effects; low income levels affect only the poorest households. The net adverse impacts on cognitive function prevail even though both dimensions of poverty reallocate attention to scarce-resource tasks. These results broaden our understanding of the impacts of uncertainty by exploring a psychological channel distinct from risk aversion, and help reconcile apparently contradictory evidence on the cognitive impact of poverty in previous studies.",

However, their association with health indices is less well understood.\r\nObjective: To investigate the association of history of sexual harassment and sexual assault with blood pressure, mood, anxiety, and sleep among midlife women.\r\nDesign, setting, and participants: Nonsmoking women without cardiovascular disease were recruited from the community to undergo physical measurements (blood pressure, height, weight), medical history, and questionnaire psychosocial assessments (workplace sexual harassment, sexual assault, depression, anxiety, sleep).\r\nExposures: Sexual harassment and sexual assault.\r\nMain outcomes and measures: Blood pressure, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep characteristics.\r\nResults: Among the 304 nonsmoking women aged 40 to 60 years who participated in the study, all were free of clinical cardiovascular disease, and the mean (SD) age was 54.05 (3.99) years. A total of 19% reported a history of workplace sexual harassment (n = 58), and 22% reported a history of sexual assault (n = 67). Sexual harassment was related to significantly greater odds of stage 1 or 2 hypertension among women not taking antihypertensives (odds ratio [OR], 2.36; 95% CI, 1.10-5.06; P = .03) as well as clinically poor sleep (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.05-3.42; P = .03), after adjusting for covariates.

There are many factors that contribute to dementia caregiver vulnerability and these factors can be challenging to assess in clinical settings. Self-rated health (SRH) is an independent measure of survival and physical health in the elderly. As an inclusive measure of health, SRH has been proposed as a reliable way to assess a patient\u2019s general health in primary care. Therefore, we sought to identify determinants of poor/fair SRH versus categories of at least good SRH in informal caregivers.\r\nMethods\r\nIn a cross-sectional study, we examined 134 elderly (\u226555\u2009years) providing in-home care for a spouse with dementia who rated their own health with a single-item question: \u201cIn general, would you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?\u201d. In a multivariable model, we compared caregivers with poor/fair SRH to those with good, very good, or excellent SRH on demographics, health characteristics (health behaviors, physical health indicators, psychosocial factors) and caregiving-specific stress (a composite index/total of four caregiving-specific stressors: years of caregiving, dementia severity, care recipient functional impairment and perceived caregiver burden).\r\nResults\r\nCompared with caregivers who rated their own health as either good (31.3%), very good (38.8%) or excellent (14.2%), caregivers with poor/fair SRH (15.7%) were more likely to have lower physical function and total greater caregiving-specific stress. More years of caregiving, severe dementia and care recipient functional impairment, but not perceived caregiver burden, were also more likely among caregivers with poor/fair SRH. Additionally, high negative affect and low positive affect were more likely in caregivers with poor/fair vs. good or excellent and very good or excellent SRH, respectively.\r\nConclusions\r\nCaregivers with poor/fair SRH were characterized by higher levels of medical comorbidity, low physical function, high negative, but low positive affect and longer duration of caregiving, as well as more severe dementia and greater functional impairment of the care recipient. These findings suggest that caregivers need to be more closely evaluated and targeted for preventive interventions in clinical practice.\r\nTrial Registration\r\nClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT02317523.",

It has numerous repercussions on patients, including poor self-esteem, higher illness severity, poor adherence to care and reduced global functioning. The goal of this study was to compare internalized stigma between three diagnoses frequently seen in psychiatric practice: Borderline personality disorder (BPD), Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Bipolar disorder (BD).\r\nMETHODS:\r\n\r\nA total of 244 French-speaking patients were recruited in a specialized psychiatric center at University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland. 39 patients had a diagnosis of BPD, 136 had ADHD and 69 had BD. Every subjects completed the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale, which is the most widely used scale employed to measure of internalized stigma. One way ANOVA analysis with adjustment on age and gender was done to compare the three groups (BPD, ADHD, BD).\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nParticipants with BPD reported higher ISMI score than subjects with ADHD and BD. BD experienced more internalized-stigma than ADHD. Higher ISMI score was also associated with higher severity of the respective disorder, poorer quality of life and unemployment.\r\nLIMITATIONS:\r\n\r\nLimitations of this research include the small sample, especially in BPD group. A disequilibrium between male and female subjects can also impact our results. Observational nature of our study mean that we can only make correlation between variables and not infer causality. Finally, other confounding factors not taken into account in this study may have had influence on stigma.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nOur findings are coherent with recent literature on BPD reporting high level of distress and of stigmatization. This has serious consequences on provided care and need to be address by mental health professionals to assure the optimal service to this population.",

        "document": "Title: Reassembling austerity research\nAbstract: This paper draws out some of the ambivalences of the bourgeoning work on urban practices of sharing, collaborating and saving and their recent conceptualizations: In political economy accounts of neoliberal urbanism, these practices are seen as a means of coping with \u2013 and thereby often reinforcing \u2013 larger structural transformations that reproduce urban inequality (Peck, 2012). More agency-oriented approaches highlight their collaborative, political potential to argue that these practices may open up the possibility to shape neoliberal urbanisms in alternative ways (F\u00e4rber, 2014a). This paper attempts to move beyond such potentially constraining conceptualizations. First, in a theoretical discussion, we attend to both lines of thinking and seek to critically acknowledge their traps and constraints. Second, we relate low budget practices to concerns about poverty. Our theoretical approach and the introduction of practices that could be better described as no budget practices allow us to question some of the assumptions that are underlying the emerging discourse on how to best conceptualize such responses to scarcity. In conclusion, we call for a closer scrutiny of the empirical realities and contexts within which low budget practices are embedded in order to avoid the possible trap of exaggerating or ignoring their effects.",

        "document": "Title: Update of the ULtra-early TRranexamic Acid after subarachnoid hemorrhage (ULTRA) trial: statistical analysis plan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Recurrent bleeding from an intracranial aneurysm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with unfavorable outcome. Recurrent bleeding before aneurysm occlusion can be performed occurs in up to one in five patients and most often happens within the first 6 h after the primary hemorrhage. Reducing the rate of recurrent bleeding could be a major factor in improving clinical outcome after SAH. Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces the risk of recurrent bleeding but has thus far not been shown to improve functional outcome, probably because of a higher risk of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). To reduce the risk of ultraearly recurrent bleeding, TXA should be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis and before transportation to a tertiary care center. If TXA is administered for a short duration (i.e., <\u200924\u2009h), it may not increase the risk of DCI. The aim of this paper is to present in detail the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of the ULTRA trial (ULtra-early TRranexamic Acid after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage), which is currently enrolling patients and investigating whether ultraearly and short-term TXA treatment in patients with aneurysmal SAH improves clinical outcome at 6 months.\r\nMETHODS/DESIGN: The ULTRA trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint, parallel-group trial currently ongoing at 8 tertiary care centers and 16 of their referral centers in the Netherlands. Participants are randomized to standard care or to receive TXA at a loading dose of 1\u2009g, immediately followed by 1\u2009g every 8 h for a maximum of 24\u2009h, in addition to standard care, as soon as SAH is diagnosed. In the TXA group, TXA administration is stopped immediately prior to treatment (coil or clip) of the causative aneurysm. Primary outcome is the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 6 months after SAH, dichotomized into good (mRS 0-3) and poor (mRS 4-6) outcomes, assessed blind to treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes include case fatalities at 30 days and at 6 months and causes of poor clinical outcome. Safety outcomes are recurrent bleeding, DCI, hydrocephalus, per-procedural complications, and other complications such as infections occurring during hospitalization. Data analyses will be according to this prespecified SAP.\r\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register, NTR3272. Registered on 25 January 2012. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02684812.

Our study yields unexpected results. First, powerful managers receive higher pay and a contract with a higher pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) if firm performance is low and vice versa. Moreover, we identify conditions where expected pay and expected PPS are both increasing in the friendliness of the board. Second, we show that friendly boards provide managers with higher salaries, more shares, but less options. Third, friendly boards offering contracts with a higher PPS also make more intensive use of relative performance evaluation (RPE). Overall, our results suggest that frequently used indicators of poor (or sound) compensation practices should be interpreted with care. Extending the scope of our model beyond executive pay, we show that powerful managers underinvest in capital but have less incentives to manage earnings.",

I address this question by exploiting year-to-year seasonal variations in temperature and detailed crime data I assembled from Savoyard criminal procedures over the period 1749--89. I find that temperature shocks had a positive and significant effect on the level of property crimes, but no significant effect on violent crimes. I further document how seasonal migration may help to increase the coping capacity of local communities in which they were widely used. Migrant labourers brought remittances to supplement communities' resources and also temporarily relieve their communities of the burden of feeding them. I show that temperature shocks were strongly associated with increase in the property crimes rate, but the effect is much lower in provinces with high levels of seasonal migration. I provide historical evidence to show that the inflow of remittances may drive this relationship.",

Only 5%-10% patients die of metastatic disease after tumorectomy, but tumor progression cannot be predicted by histopathological parameters alone. chRCC are characterized by losses of many chromosomes, whereas gene mutations are rare. In this study, we aim at identifying genes indicating chRCC progression. A bioinformatic approach was used to correlate chromosomal loss and mRNA expression from 15287 genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. All genes in TCGA chromophobe renal cancer dataset (KICH) for which a significant correlation between chromosomal loss and mRNA expression was shown, were identified and their associations with outcome was assessed. Genome-wide DNA copy-number alterations were analyzed by Affymetrix OncoScan$^{\u00ae}$ CNV FFPE Microarrays in a second cohort of Swiss chRCC. In both cohorts, tumors with loss of chromosomes 2, 6, 10, 13, 17 and 21 had signs of tumor progression. There were 4654 genes located on these chromosomes, and 13 of these genes had reduced mRNA levels, which was associated with poor outcome in chRCC. Decreased CDKN1A expression at mRNA (p = 0.02) and protein levels (p = 0.02) were associated with short overall survival and were independent predictors of prognosis (p <0.01 and <0.05 respectively). CDKN1A expression status is a prognostic biomarker independent of tumor stage. CDKN1A immunohistochemistry may be used to identify chRCC patients at greater risk of disease progression.",

There is considerable potential for inequalities in health-promoting behaviors and health outcomes, arising from poverty, social, and environmental factors. This suggests that individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and circumstances may have more exposure to (chronic) stressors, coupled with reduced access to resources, and increased susceptibility to risk factors for ill-health and mental disorders in later life. This drastically decreases the likelihood for successful aging in individuals from less advantaged backgrounds. Nevertheless, despite these adverse circumstances, some high-risk, disadvantaged individuals have been shown to achieve and maintain good health and well-being into later life.\r\n\r\nMethod: This scientific update provides an overview of recently published research with samples that, against expectations, demonstrate successful aging.\r\n\r\nResults: Favorable personality traits, cognitive strategies, and a high-level of intrinsic motivation, paired with a supportive social environment, have been found to build a prosperous basis for successful aging and positive health outcomes in later life for individuals living in aversive environmental circumstances.\r\n\r\nConclusion: For clinical psychologists, the movement towards the investigation of underlying mechanisms of successful aging from a psychological perspective, particularly in disadvantaged individuals, may be a critical step towards understanding the vast heterogeneity in aging.",

        "document": "Title: Why have Non-communicable Diseases been Left Behind?\nAbstract: Non-communicable diseases are no longer largely limited to high-income countries and the elderly. The burden of non-communicable diseases is rising across all country income categories, in part because these diseases have been relatively overlooked on the global health agenda. Historically, communicable diseases have been prioritized in many countries as they were perceived to constitute the greatest disease burden, especially among vulnerable and poor populations, and strategies for prevention and treatment, which had been successful in high-income settings, were considered feasible and often affordable in low-income settings. This prioritization has reduced the communicable diseases burden globally but has left non-communicable diseases largely neglected. A new approach is urgently needed to tackle non-communicable diseases. Based on an analysis of potential features which may have underlain the different approaches to non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases until now, including acuity of disease, potential for control or cure, cost, infectiousness, blaming of individuals and logistical barriers, little ethical or rational justification can be found to support continued neglect of non-communicable diseases. Justice demands access to quality and affordable care for all. An equitable approach to non-communicable diseases is therefore strongly mandated on medical, ethical, economic, and public health grounds. Funding must not however be diverted away from communicable diseases, which continue to require attention\u2014but concomitantly, funding for noncommunicable diseases must be increased. International and multi-sectoral action is required to accelerate progress towards true universal health coverage and towards achievement of all of the sustainable development goals, such that prevention and access to care for non-communicable disease can become a global reality.",

The current, large country-level variation in the reported incidence and prevalence of treated end-stage kidney disease indicates the existence of system-level inequities. Equitable implementation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) programs must address issues of availability, affordability, and acceptability. The major structural factors that impact equity in KRT in different countries are the organization of health systems, overall health care spending, funding and delivery models, and nature of KRT prioritization (transplantation, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and conservative care). Implementation of KRT programs has the potential to exacerbate inequity unless equity is deliberately addressed. In this review, we summarize discussions on equitable provision of KRT in low- and middle-income countries and suggest areas for future research.",

        "document": "Title: Contextual and psychosocial factors predicting Ebola prevention behaviours using the RANAS approach to behaviour change in Guinea-Bissau\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\r\nThe outbreak of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa in December 2013 was the largest Ebola outbreak in history. This study aimed to measure the underlying contextual and psychosocial factors of intentions to perform Ebola prevention behaviours (not touching people who might be suffering from Ebola, reporting suspected cases to the National Ebola Hotline, NEH) in Guinea-Bissau. Geographical location, cross-border market activities, poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) conditions, and burial practices in some communities pose a serious risk in terms of potential EVD outbreak and seriously hamper its prevention in Guinea-Bissau.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: In July and August 2015, quantitative data from 1369 respondents were gathered by structured face-to-face interviews. The questionnaire was based on the psychosocial factors of the RANAS (risks, attitudes, norms, abilities, and self-regulation) model. Data were analyzed by multiple linear regression analyses.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: The most important predictors for the intention to call the NEH were believing that calling the Hotline would help the infected person, perceiving that important members from the household approve of calling the Hotline, thinking that calling the Hotline is something they should do, and believing that it is important to call the Hotline to report a suspected case. For the intention not to touch someone who might be suffering from Ebola, the most important predictors were health knowledge, the perception of risk with regard to touching a person who might be suffering from Ebola, and the belief that they were able not to touch a possibly infected person. Age in years was the only significant contextual predictor for one of the two behavioural intentions, the intention to call the Hotline. It seems that younger people are more likely to use a service like the NEH than older people.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Strengths and gaps were identified in the study population in relation to the intention to perform prevention behaviours. These call for innovative ways of aligning existing hygiene programs with relevant psychosocial factors. This research is relevant to further outbreaks of contagious diseases as it sheds light on important aspects of the impact of public health interventions during emergencies and epidemics.",

        "document": "Title: Influencing factors on the foot health of captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in European zoos\nAbstract: Pathological lesions of feet occur frequently in captive elephant populations. To improve foot health, it is important to identify risk factors associated with such pathologies. Several previous studies have analyzed potentially influencing factors but were limited, for example, by small sample sizes. This study analyzed the relationship between 87 independent variables and the foot health score of 204 Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in European zoos using bivariate correlation, multivariable regression models, and principal component analysis (PCA). Correlation and regression tests revealed significant results for 30 different variables, mainly with small effect sizes. Only three variables were significant in more than one test: sex, time spent indoors, and time spent on hard ground, with lower scores (i.e. less or less severe pathological lesions) in females, and when less time is spent indoors or on hard ground. Due to small effect sizes and differing results of the statistical tests, it is difficult to determine which risk factors are most important. Instead, a holistic consideration appears more appropriate. A biplot of the PCA shows that factors representing more advanced husbandry conditions (e.g. large areas, high proportions of sand flooring) were associated with each other and with decreased foot scores, whereas indicators of more limited conditions (e.g. high proportions of hard ground, much time spent indoors) were also associated with each other but increased the foot score. In conclusion, instead of resulting from just one or two factors, reduced foot health might be an indicator of a generally poorer husbandry system.",

However, evidence of its effectiveness in lower income countries is lacking. This mixed methods study presents lessons learned and preliminary data on the feasibility of a minimally guided e-mental health intervention in Lebanon. The aim was to pilot test Step-by-Step, a WHO guided e-mental health intervention, and research methods prior to future, controlled testing.\r\n\r\nMethods: Participants were recruited using social media and advertisements in primary care clinics. Participants completed baseline and post-intervention questionnaires on depression symptoms (primary outcome, PHQ-8), anxiety symptoms, well-being, disability and self-perceived problem severity, and a client satisfaction questionnaire. In addition, seven completers, four drop-outs, 11 study staff, and four clinic managers were interviewed with responses thematically analyzed. Website analytics were used to understand participant behavior when using the website.\r\n\r\nResults: A total of 129 participants signed up via the Step-by-Step website. Seventy-four participants started session 1 after completing pre-test questionnaires and 26 completed both baseline and post-intervention data. Among those who completed post-assessments, depression symptoms improved (PHQ-8 scores (t=5.62, p < 0.001 two-tailed, df = 25). Wilcoxon signed ranks tests showed a significant difference between baseline and post-Step-by-Step scores on all secondary outcome measures. Client satisfaction data was positive. Interview responses suggested that the intervention could be made more appropriate for younger, single people, more motivating, and easier to use. Those who utilized the support element of the intervention were happy with their relationship with the non-specialist support person (e-helper), though some participants would have preferred specialist support. E-helpers would have liked more training on complex cases. Website analytics showed that many users dropped out before intervention start, and that some re-entered screening data having been excluded from the study.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Step-by-Step skills and techniques, model of service integration, and its non-specialist support element are acceptable. Though the sample was small and non-controlled and drop-out was high, results suggest that it may be effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and increasing well-being. Lessons learned will inform content revision, the development of an app version of Step-by-Step, and the research methodology of upcoming effectiveness studies.",

Agreement between the categories was defined as at least six of eight (cut-off 75%) concordant diagnoses.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe highest agreement between eight pathologists was reached using the category lobular neoplasia (LN, classical), 26/40 (65%) cases were diagnosed as such. Agreements in other categories was low or poor: 12/40 (30%) (ALH), 9/40 (22%) (LCIS), 8/40 (20%) (LIN-1), 8/40 (20%) (focal B3), 3/40 (7.5%) (LIN-2), and 2/40 (5%) (extensive B3). Chi-square-test (classical LN versus the other nomenclatures) was significant (p\u2009=\u20090.001137).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOur data suggest that among Swiss breast pathologists, the most reproducible diagnosis for B3 lobular lesions is the category of classical LN. These data further support lack of consistent data in retrospective studies using different terminologies. Validation of reproducible nomenclature is warranted in further studies. This information is useful especially in view of retro- and prospective data analysis with different diagnostic categories.",

Audiometric assessment was performed pre- and postoperatively. The ChOLE classification was determined intraoperatively and via the preoperative CT scan. HRQoL was assessed pre- and postoperatively using the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21).\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nA total of 87 patients (mean age 45.2 years, SD 16.2) were included in this study. ChOLE stage I cholesteatoma was found in 8 (9%), stage II cholesteatoma was found in 65 (75%), and stage III cholesteatoma was found in 14 (16%) patients. Postoperatively, the mean air-bone gap (0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz) was significantly smaller than before surgery (14.3 dB vs. 23.0 dB; p\u2009=\u20090.0007). The mean ZCMEI-21 total score significantly decreased after surgery (26.8 vs. 20.7, p\u2009=\u20090.004). No correlation between the ZCMEI-21 total score and both the ChOLE stage and the extent of the cholesteatoma (ChOLE subdivision \"Ch\") was found. A trend towards worse HRQoL associated with a poorer status of the ossicular chain (ChOLE subdivision \"O\") was observed. The audiometric outcomes were not associated with the extent of the cholesteatoma. The ChOLE subdivision describing the ossicular status showed a strong association with the pre- and postoperative air conduction (AC) thresholds. Further, the ZCMEI-21 total score and its hearing subscore correlated with the AC thresholds.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThe ChOLE classification does not show a clear association with HRQoL measured by the ZCMEI-21. The HRQoL neither seems to be associated with the extent of the disease nor with the ossicular chain status. Yet, surgical therapy significantly improved HRQoL by means of reduced ZCMEI-21 total scores, which were strongly associated with the AC thresholds. Intraoperative assessment of a cholesteatoma using the ChOLE classification and HRQoL complement each other and provide useful information.",

Therefore, the prognosis is poor for this dismal disease, with only 1-2% of the patients reaching the 5-year survival follow-up. Current advances in systemic treatment with gemcitabine regimens, specifically polychemotherapy with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel or other multidrug regimens such as FOLFIRINOX in the first line, have improved disease control over time. This higher efficacy of systemic treatment enables metastatic PDAC patients to receive second-line treatment more often nowadays. Currently, there is only one regimen for second-line treatment approved by the EMA, FDA, and Swissmedic, based on the phase III NAPOLI-1 study. In this case report, we present an outstanding response to sequential treatment with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel followed by second-line treatment with nal-irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil.",

These differences are linked to institutional patterns at the country level. Here, we observe that the two countries differ especially in bargaining centralisation, employment protection legislation and family policy. At the same time, the levels of decommodification and labour market regulation are no longer core differences in the institutional settings of Germany and the UK, which is interpreted as a consequence of Germany\u2019s departure from a traditional conservative regime since the mid-1990s. Adopting economic and sociological approaches, we explain how Germany\u2019s closed employment system channels the effects of deregulation policies to the periphery of the labour market. Additionally, we argue that open employment relationships that dominate in the UK put specifically older employees at risk. Finally, we identify country-specific differences in the economic dependency of women, resulting from a stronger male breadwinner orientation of family policy in Germany. Accordingly, multivariate analyses based on harmonised versions of the British Household Panel Study (2002\u20132005) and the Socio-Economic Panel Study (2003\u20132006) reveal that entrants and re-entrants to the labour market, women and \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 low-educated persons are particularly affected by in-work poverty in Germany; whereas older workers are more likely to face precarious economic conditions in the UK.",

        "document": "Title: How to measure and proxy permanent income: evidence from Germany and the U.S.\nAbstract: Permanent income (PI) is an enduring concept in the social sciences and is highly relevant to the study of inequality. Nevertheless, there has been insufficient progress in measuring PI. We calculate a novel measure of PI with the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Advancing beyond prior approaches, we define PI as the logged average of 20+ years of post-tax and post-transfer (\u201cpost-fisc\u201d) real equivalized household income. We then assess how well various household- and individual-based measures of economic resources proxy PI. In both datasets, post-fisc household income is the best proxy. One random year of post-fisc household income explains about half of the variation in PI, and 2\u20135 years explain the vast majority of the variation. One year of post-fisc HH income even predicts PI better than 20+ years of individual labor market earnings or long-term net worth. By contrast, earnings, wealth, occupation, and class are weaker and less cross-nationally reliable proxies for PI. We also present strategies for proxying PI when HH post-fisc income data are unavailable, and show how post-fisc HH income proxies PI over the life cycle. In sum, we develop a novel approach to PI, systematically assess proxies for PI, and inform the measurement of economic resources more generally.",

Biomarkers are urgently needed as a majority of patients do not respond, despite treatment-related toxicities.

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), we first show that the general poverty rate in Germany has constantly increased since the late 1990s. Shifting to a life-course perspective, we show that not only socio-structural characteristics have a strong impact on the poverty risk, but also critical life-events. While focusing on dynamics of poverty within individual life-courses, it appears that incidents like formation of a 'new household, birth of a child and separation from partner are associated with an immediate increase of the poverty risk. The event of becoming unemployed stands particularly out. Comparing longitudinal and fixed-effects approaches on the one hand with simple cross-sectional procedures on the other, our analyses finally emphasises that cross-sectional analyses are not sufficient to fully understand or to explain poverty. Therefore, our study can be interpreted as a claim to make stronger use of the benefits of longitudinal data in the context of poverty research.",

Trotzdem konnte in vielen Studien zum \u201eWorking Poor\u201c - Problem kein tief greifender Wandel der materiellen Lebensbedingungen von Erwerbst\u00e4tigen nachgewiesen werden. Dies ist darauf zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren, dass etablierte Erwerbst\u00e4tige durch institutionelle Mechanismen weitestgehend vor den Auswirkungen der Reformen (bzw. vor einer Abwertung ihrer Arbeitsmarktposition) gesch\u00fctzt sind. Dieser Schutz besteht allerdings nicht f\u00fcr Personen, die nicht durch vorgelagerte Erwerbst\u00e4tigkeit abgesichert sind. Dementsprechend zeigen empirische Analysen auf der Basis des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels (SOEP), dass sich niedrig entlohnte Besch\u00e4ftigung und Armut insbesondere unter Einsteigern auf dem Arbeitsmarkt (aus dem Bildungssystem und bei \u00dcberg\u00e4ngen aus der Erwerbslosigkeit) ausgebreitet haben.

Nevertheless, many studies about the working poor have not revealed a serious\r\nchange in the material living conditions of the employed. This can be explained by the basic constitution of the German\r\nwelfare state and labor market, which protect established employees from the effects of reforms, and consequently from\r\na decline in their labor market position. However, this does not apply to persons who are not protected because of previous employment. Accordingly, empirical analyses on the basis of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) show that low-wage work and poverty have spread among entrants and re-entrants in the labor market. Thus, with regard to the overall\r\ndevelopment of the working poor rate, the risks of these groups have increased disproportionately.",

Decreased equity of dyadic coping across the transition to parenthood associated with depression of first-time parents\nAbstract: The transition to parenthood (TTP) is a stressful life event for most couples. Therefore, the way both partners jointly cope with stress (i.e., dyadic coping) is important for the prevention of individual adjustment problems (e.g., depression). For dyadic coping to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms, efforts of both partners should be equal. However, many couples experience a decrease of equity in task division within the domestic sphere across the TTP. The current study investigates the equity of a specific skill within the 'relationship sphere', because similarly to a decreased equity in household and childcare, a decreased equity of dyadic coping is likely to be associated with poorer individual adjustment. We collected longitudinal self-report data on dyadic coping and depressive symptoms from 104 mixed-gender first-time parents (n = 208 individuals) from pregnancy until 40 weeks postpartum. We created an equity score for men and women that measured their perceived difference between received and provided dyadic coping. On average, women reported providing more and receiving less dyadic coping than men. While both genders agreed on this distribution, men did perceive a higher equity of dyadic coping than women. Furthermore, the decrease of equity perceived by women across TTP was not visible in men. In line with our assumptions based on the equity theory, perceived equity of dyadic coping was associated with depressive symptoms in a curvilinear manner: Decreases in women's perceived equity in either direction (over- or underbenefit) were associated with more depressive symptoms in women and their male partners. This association was found above and beyond the beneficial effect of dyadic coping itself. This implies that not only how well partners support each other in times of stress, but also how equal both partners' efforts are, is important for their individual adjustment across TTP.",

We differentiate between dismissals following actual poor performance on the pitch (wise dismissals) and dismissals following seemingly poor performance due to bad luck (unwise dismissals). To categorize dismissals, we use \u201cexpected goals,\u201d which are less vulnerable to random variation in match outcomes. Using data from European football, we find that wise dismissals increase subsequent performance compared to a control group of nondismissals with similarly poor performance on the pitch.

Some of these fears are fueled by fear-related news as a form of sensational media coverage. As research on the variety of fears depicted in the news is scarce, this study analyzes the construction of fear-related news in the US and the UK from 1990 to 2017. By combining unsupervised machine learning in the form of topic modeling (N =\u200915,487) and manual content analysis (N\u2009=\u20091013), it explores the prevalence of themes and topics. It also analyzes the fear-inducing presentation of news through the use of fear appeals, specifically which (severe) threats are emphasized by the media. Results indicate that the media do not only concentrate on fears of violence and crime, but also on fears of economic downturn, political unrest, or social fears concerning unemployment. The most prominent threat emphasized across topics is death, followed by political and economic threats. Topic prevalence is highly volatile and coverage has not become more fear-inducing over time. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how news media may foster fear: through mirroring a variety of economic, political and social fears and emphasizing specific threats across them.",

Preliminary studies indicate that quantification of tumor metabolic uptake may correlate with tumor hypoxia and aggressive phenotypes.\r\n\r\nMethods: Retrospective review of a consecutive cohort of OSCC (n = 98) with available pretherapeutic FDG-PET/CT, treated at the University Hospital Zurich. Clinico-pathologico-radiological correlation between maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumor, immunohistochemical staining for hypoxia-related proteins glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1a), depth of invasion (DOI), lymph node metastasis, and outcome was examined.\r\n\r\nResults: Positive staining for GLUT1 and HIF1a on immunohistopathological analysis correlated with increased SUVmax on pretherapeutic imaging and with increased DOI (Kruskal\u2013Wallis, P = 0.037, and P = 0.008, respectively). SUVmax and DOI showed a strong positive correlation (Spearman Rho, correlation coefficient = 0.451, P = 0.0003). An increase in SUVmax predicted nodal metastasis (Kruskal\u2013Wallis, P = 0.017) and poor local control (log rank, P = 0.047).\r\n\r\nConclusion: In OSCC, FDG-PET-derived metabolic tumor parameter SUVmax serves as a surrogate marker for hypoxia and can be used to predict tumor aggressiveness, with more invasive phenotypes and poorer local control.",

        "document": "Title: Co-development of Couples' Life Satisfaction in Transition to Retirement:A Longitudinal Dyadic Perspective\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: Retirement is one of the major life course transitions in old age. Evidence suggests that exiting work life is associated with notable changes in life satisfaction, which are heterogeneous across individuals. Effects of retirement transitions on life satisfaction have been understudied in couples. We examined change in life satisfaction with retirement for retirees and their spouses/partners, the extent to which change in life satisfaction was heterogeneous and correlated within couples, and associations with health status and social participation.\r\n\r\nMETHOD: We used data from the German Socio-Economic Panel obtained in the years 1984 to 2016 (n = 2,117 couples; 74% male retirees; age at retirement: M = 61 years, SD = 3 years, range = 55 to 70 years; 98% married or in a registered relationship). We examined health and social participation of retirees and their partners as predictor variables and controlled for age, gender, education, partner employment, household income, and region in Germany (former East vs. West). Data were analyzed with dyadic multilevel two-phase growth curve models.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: On average, both retirees and partners reported increasing life satisfaction at retirement. Change in life satisfaction was heterogeneous across individuals and highly correlated within couples. Health and social participation were associated with levels of, but not change in life satisfaction with retirement in retirees and partners.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: Retirement is not a uniform period of transition, but is shaped by the multidimensional context in which life unfolds. Moreover, life satisfaction can be shaped in response to life transitions experienced by close others.",

With blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(-): 0.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11 vs. 0.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04; p\u2009=\u20090.007 and 0.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 vs. 0.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04; p\u2009=\u20090.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (p\u2009=\u20090.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group.

        "document": "Title: Harming to signal: child marriage vs. public donations in Malawi\nAbstract: In Malawi, only 5% of parents state that the right age for a woman to marry is below 18, but 42% of girls get married before they reach that legal age. We document that social image concerns are likely an important mechanism behind that wedge: where the prevalence of child marriage is high, those who do not marry off their under-age daughters are perceived as less altruistic, reciprocal and trustworthy than those who do. We then randomly assign 412 villages to a public donation drive, through which participants could donate maize to be redistributed to the poorest in their village. The idea is that increasing the visibility of charitable behavior \u2013 which also contributes to social image \u2013 might provide a less costly but as visible alternative to child marriage for parents who are only willing to engage in it out of social image concerns. One year after the intervention, we find that girls\u2019 marriages and teenage pregnancies decrease by roughly 30% in treated villages relative to the control group. Consistent with the social image mechanism, (1) charitable behavior increases the most in villages where child marriage was most prevalent at baseline, and (2) in those villages, parents who do not marry off their under-age daughters are no longer perceived as less pro-social than others. We rule out that child marriage is delayed merely because poor families have additional resources due to donations from the drive, and provide evidence that treatment effects increase with the visibility of the intervention. Our findings provide novel evidence on how far individuals might go to protect their social image, and inform new strategies to disrupt arguably inefficient norms when there is a wedge between private and social motives.",

Information regarding specific treatments is lacking. Class A CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-A) are short single-stranded DNAs, stimulating type I interferon production. In cats, CpG-A induced an antiviral response in vivo and inhibited FPV replication in vitro. The aim was to prospectively investigate the effects of CpG-A on survival, clinical score, hematological findings, antiviral response (cytokines), viremia, and fecal shedding (real-time qPCR) in cats naturally infected with FPV. Forty-two FPV-infected cats were randomized to receive 100 \u00b5g/kg of CpG-A (n = 22) or placebo (n = 20) subcutaneously, on admission and after 48 h. Blood and fecal samples were collected on admission, after 1, 3, and 7 days. All 22 cats showed short duration pain during CpG-A injections. The survival rate, clinical score, leukocyte and erythrocyte counts, viremia, and fecal shedding at any time-point did not differ between cats treated with CpG-A (50%) and placebo (40%). Antiviral myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene transcription increased in both groups from day 1 to 3 (p = 0.005). Antibodies against FPV on admission were associated with survival in cats (p = 0.002). In conclusion, CpG-A treatment did not improve the outcome in cats with FPV infection. FPV infection produced an antiviral response.",

I find that temperature shocks had a positive and significant effect on the level of property crimes, but a negative and significant effect on violent crimes. I further document how seasonal migration helped to increase the coping capacity of local communities. Indeed, migrant labour both brought in remittances that supplemented communities\u2019 resources, as well as temporarily relieved impoverished households of the burden of feeding these workers. I show that while temperature shocks were strongly associated with an increase in property crime rates, the effect was much lower in provinces with high levels of seasonal migration.

Some of the superrich may be \u201csuperstars\u201d for whom small differences in talent are magnified into much larger earnings differences, while others may work in winner-take-all markets, such that their effort to climb the ladder of success reduces the returns to others. We stress that pivotal tax-rate elasticities are not structural parameters and will be smaller the broader and less plastic is the tax base and the more effective is the enforcement of tax evasion. For this reason, normative analysis of tax rates should be accompanied by attention to the tax base, with a special focus on capital gains, which comprise a large fraction of the taxable income of the superrich.",

Despite this understanding, investigation of neurocognitive deficits in UHR individuals with MDD and its association with MDD within this population, has been scarce. Hence, this study aimed to examine any differences in neurocognition at baseline between those with MDD at baseline and those with no history of MDD, as well as determine whether neurocognitive variables are significantly associated with meeting criteria for MDD at follow-up, while controlling for relevant clinical variables, within a UHR cohort. Data analysis was conducted on 207 participants whose baseline neurocognition was assessed using Brief Assessment of Cognition for Schizophrenia, as part of a trial of omega-3 fatty acids (NEURAPRO) for UHR individuals. While baseline MDD was the strongest predictor, poorer verbal memory and higher verbal fluency were significantly associated with MDD at 12 months (p = .04 and 0.026, respectively). Further, higher processing speed was significantly associated with MDD at medium-term follow-up (p = .047). These findings outline that neurocognitive skills were independently associated with meeting criteria for MDD at follow-up within UHR individuals, with novel findings of better verbal fluency and processing speed being linked to MDD outcomes. Hence, neurocognitive performance should be considered as a marker of risk for MDD outcomes and a target for management of MDD in UHR.",

The prognostic value of sequential post-therapeutic FDG-PETs and the impact of change in metabolic activity has been scarcely reported so far. We hypothesized that an increase in metabolic activity (as measured by maximum standardized uptake value, SUVmax) would be predictive for recurrence. We retrospectively assessed all oral, oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients treated at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology\u2014Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital Zurich between April 1st, 2010 and September 30th, 2018 (N\u2009=\u2009337). After a negative post-treatment FDG-PET at 3\u00a0months, we measured the SUVmax of the local tumor area and the regional lymph nodes on follow-up FDG-PET at 9\u00a0months. We then correlated SUVmax difference between 9 and 3\u00a0months with tumor recurrence using Kaplan Meier analysis. During follow-up, 68 patients (20.2%) had local recurrence and 53 had regional recurrence (15.7%) at a median time of 9.0 (IQR 4.25\u201314) and 7.0 (IQR 5.25\u201323) months, respectively. An increase in local and/or regional SUVmax from the 3\u00a0months to the 9\u00a0months post-therapeutic FDG-PET resulted in a poorer recurrence-free survival (Log rank, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\u2009=\u20090.001, for both). An increase in local SUVmax between 3 and 9\u00a0months was associated with a hazard ratio of 4.17 for recurrence (95%CI 1.89\u20139.2, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\u2009=\u20090.0003). In conclusion, an increase in metabolic activity/SUVmax between two post-therapeutic FDG-PETs requires a histological examination as it is associated with tumor recurrence.",

Here, we aimed to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers for OCD, using 46 data sets with 2304 OCD patients and 2068 healthy controls from the ENIGMA consortium. We performed machine learning analysis of regional measures of cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume and tested classification performance using cross-validation. Classification performance for OCD vs. controls using the complete sample with different classifiers and cross-validation strategies was poor. When models were validated on data from other sites, model performance did not exceed chance-level. In contrast, fair classification performance was achieved when patients were grouped according to their medication status. These results indicate that medication use is associated with substantial differences in brain anatomy that are widely distributed, and indicate that clinical heterogeneity contributes to the poor performance of structural MRI as a disease marker.",

Consistency in assigning an avalanche danger level when forecasting or locally assessing avalanche hazard is essential, but challenging to achieve, as relevant information is often scarce and must be interpreted in the light of uncertainties. Furthermore, the definitions of the danger levels, an ordinal variable, are vague and leave room for interpretation. Decision tools, developed to assist in assigning a danger level, are primarily experience-based due to a lack of data. Here, we address this lack of quantitative evidence by exploring a large data set of stability tests (N\u2009=\u200910,125) and avalanche observations (N\u2009=\u200939,017) from two countries related to the three key factors that characterize avalanche danger: snowpack stability, its frequency distribution and avalanche size. We show that the frequency of the most unstable locations increases with increasing danger level. However, a similarly clear relation between avalanche size and danger level was not found. Only for the higher danger levels the size of the largest avalanche per day and warning region increased. Furthermore, we derive stability distributions typical for the danger levels 1-Low to 4-High using four stability classes (very poor, poor, fair and good), and define frequency classes (none or nearly none, a few, several and many) describing the frequency of the most unstable locations. Combining snowpack stability, its frequency and avalanche size in a simulation experiment, typical descriptions for the four danger levels are obtained. Finally, using the simulated snowpack distributions together with the largest avalanche size in a step-wise approach, as proposed in the Conceptual Model of Avalanche Hazard, we present an example for a data-driven look-up table for avalanche danger assessment. Our findings may aid in refining the definitions of the avalanche danger scale and in fostering its consistent usage.",

Detailed knowledge of the chronology and type of early complications after major surgery may alert clinicians when to expect higher risk for subsequent major negative events.\r\nMETHODS: All 90-day postoperative events following complex pancreas, liver, and rectal surgeries, and liver transplantation were analyzed over a 3-year period in a single tertiary center. Each complication was recorded regarding severity, type (cardiac, infectious, etc), etiology (surgical/medical), and timing of occurrence. The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), covering the first 7 postoperative days, was calculated as a measure for early cumulative postoperative morbidity. The statistical analysis (descriptive, sequence pattern analyses, and logistic regression analyses) aimed to detect any combinations of events predicting poor outcome as defined by a cumulative CCI \u226537.1 at 90-days.\r\nRESULTS: The occurrence of \u22652 complications, irrespective of severity, type or etiology, was strongly associated with a severe postoperative course (P < 0.001). Even 2 mild complications (\u2264 grade II) greatly increased the chance for high morbidity compared to patients with 0 or 1 complication within the first postoperative week (odds ratio 10.2, 95% confidence interval 5.82-17.98). The CCI at postoperative day 7 strongly predicted high 90-day morbidity (odds ratio 3.96 per 10 CCI points, P < 0.001).\r\nCONCLUSION: Multiple complications of any cause or severity within the first postoperative days represents a \"warning-signal\" for overall high morbidity by 90 days, which should be used to trigger an escalation of care to prevent failure to rescue and eventually poor outcome.",

        "document": "Title: Maternal socialization of child emotion and adolescent adjustment: Indirect effects through emotion regulation\nAbstract: A fundamental question in developmental science is how parental emotion socialization processes are associated with children's subsequent adaptation. Few extant studies have examined this question across multiple developmental periods and levels of analysis. Here, we tested whether mothers' supportive and nonsupportive reactions to their 5-year-old children's negative emotions were associated with teacher and adolescent self-reported adjustment at age 15 via children's physiological and behavioral emotion regulation at age 10 (N = 404). Results showed that maternal supportive reactions to their children's negative emotions were associated with children's greater emotion regulation in a laboratory task and also a composite of mother and teacher reports of emotion regulation at age 10. Maternal nonsupportive reactions to their children's negative emotions were uncorrelated with supportive reactions, but were associated with poorer child physiological regulation and also poorer mother- and teacher-reported emotion regulation at age 10. In turn, better physiological regulation at age 10 was associated with more adolescent-reported social competence at age 15. Furthermore, teacher and mother reports of emotion regulation at age 10 were associated with increased adolescent adjustment across all domains. Mediational effects from nonsupportive and supportive reactions to adolescent adjustment tested via bootstrapping were significant. Our findings suggest that mothers' reactions to their children's negative emotions in early childhood may play a role in their children's ability to regulate their arousal both physiologically and behaviorally in middle childhood, which in turn may play a role in their ability to manage their emotions and behaviors and to navigate increasingly complex social contexts in adolescence.

End-of-life treatment in this patient group therefore requires specific approaches. To date, little data is available on patients' and caregivers' needs and experiences in the last phase of the disease.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nIn this observational study, relatives of patients treated at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland and deceased 2015-2017 due to glioma progression were contacted to complete a structured questionnaire assessing caregivers experience within the last weeks of the disease.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe survey was sent to 120 relatives of deceased patients with a glioma (WHO grades II-IV) (median patient age: 62\u00a0years; 73.8% male). Forty-three questionnaires were returned (37.7%). Approximately half of the patients were taken care of at home in the last 4\u00a0weeks of the disease, mainly with the assistance of in-home nursing care, of which eventually 14 patients (63.6%) died at home. While caregivers reported high satisfaction with medical and nursing care, psychological support was rated average to poor on a 10-point scale. Free comment fields were used widely, revealing open questions and needs of the relatives.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThis study illustrates the need for a more patient-centered end-of-life care including higher psychological support mechanisms, and a higher inclusion and consideration of relatives and caregivers into the care focus. Earlier discussion of end-of-life preferences could prevent hospitalizations in the last phase of life and could improve patients' and caregivers' quality of life.",

Treatment with immune checkpoint blockade has shown benefits in many cancer types. To our knowledge, data from a randomized phase 3 clinical trial evaluating a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor therapy for glioblastoma have not been reported.\r\nObjective: To determine whether single-agent PD-1 blockade with nivolumab improves survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma compared with bevacizumab.\r\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: In this open-label, randomized, phase 3 clinical trial, 439 patients with glioblastoma at first recurrence following standard radiation and temozolomide therapy were enrolled, and 369 were randomized. Patients were enrolled between September 2014 and May 2015. The median follow-up was 9.5 months at data cutoff of January 20, 2017. The study included 57 multicenter, multinational clinical sites.\r\nInterventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 to nivolumab 3 mg/kg or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or death.\r\nMain Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was overall survival (OS).\r\nResults: A total of 369 patients were randomized to nivolumab (n\u2009=\u2009184) or bevacizumab (n\u2009=\u2009185). The MGMT promoter was methylated in 23.4% (43/184; nivolumab) and 22.7% (42/185; bevacizumab), unmethylated in 32.1% (59/184; nivolumab) and 36.2% (67/185; bevacizumab), and not reported in remaining patients. At median follow-up of 9.5 months, median OS (mOS) was comparable between groups: nivolumab, 9.8 months (95% CI, 8.2-11.8); bevacizumab, 10.0 months (95% CI, 9.0-11.8); HR, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.83-1.30); P\u2009=\u2009.76. The 12-month OS was 42% in both groups. The objective response rate was higher with bevacizumab (23.1%; 95% CI, 16.7%-30.5%) vs nivolumab (7.8%; 95% CI, 4.1%-13.3%). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were similar between groups (nivolumab, 33/182 [18.1%]; bevacizumab, 25/165 [15.2%]), with no unexpected neurological TRAEs or deaths due to TRAEs.\r\nConclusions and Relevance: Although the primary end point was not met in this randomized clinical trial, mOS was comparable between nivolumab and bevacizumab in the overall patient population with recurrent glioblastoma. The safety profile of nivolumab in patients with glioblastoma was consistent with that in other tumor types.\r\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02017717.",

A sample of 221 adults 60 years and older with major depression and executive dysfunction were randomized to 12 weeks of either problem-solving therapy or supportive therapy. We used Latent Growth Mixture Models (LGMM) to detect subgroups with distinct trajectories of change in depression by mid-treatment (6th week). We conducted regression analyses with LGMM subgroups as predictors of response at treatment end. We used random forest machine learning algorithms to identify baseline predictors of LGMM trajectories. We found that ~77.5% of participants had a declining trajectory of depression in weeks 0-6, while the remaining 22.5% had a persisting depression trajectory, with no treatment differences. The LGMM trajectories predicted remission and response at treatment end. A random forests model with high prediction accuracy (80%) showed that the strongest modifiable predictors of the persisting depression trajectory were low perceived social support, followed by high neuroticism, low treatment expectancy, and low perception of the therapist as accepting. Our results suggest that modifiable risk factors of early nonresponse to psychotherapy can be identified at the outset of treatment and addressed with targeted personalized interventions. Therapists may focus on increasing meaningful social interactions, addressing concerns related to treatment benefits, and creating a positive working relationship.",

        "document": "Title: Assortative matching with inequality in voluntary contribution games\nAbstract: Voluntary contribution games are a classic social dilemma in which the individually dominant strategies result in a poor performance of the population. How- ever, the negative zero-contribution predictions from these types of social dilemma situations give way to more positive (near-)efficient ones when assortativity, instead of random mixing, governs the matching process in the population. Under assortative matching, agents contribute more than what would otherwise be strategically rational in order to be matched with others doing likewise. An open question has been the robustness of such predictions when heterogeneity in budgets amongst individuals is allowed. Here, we show analytically that the consequences of permitting heterogeneity depend crucially on the exact nature of the underlying public-good provision efficacy, but generally are rather devastating. Using computational methods, we quantify the loss resulting from heterogeneity vis-a-vis the homogeneous case as a function of (i) the public-good provision efficacy and (ii) the population inequality.",

The Determinants of Unequal Income Positions in Old Age Across Europe\nAbstract: Individual prosperity and welfare can be measured using both objective and subjective criteria. Although theory and previous research suggest that these\u00a0two methods can produce corresponding results, the measurements can also be inconsistent. Against this background, the current paper investigates the relationship between the objective income position of older Europeans\u00a0(aged 50\u2009+\u2009years) and their perception of their financial situation, using the seventh wave of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) conducted in\u00a02017. The main research questions include (1) how is objective income distributed in old age across Europe? (2) how do elderly Europeans evaluate their income situation subjectively? (3) is there a discrepancy between the objective prosperity position and their subjective perception observable? (4) are there country-specific differences that are observable?, and (5) how can such discrepancies be explained? The results show that objective income positions can be congruent with subjective self-perceptions, both good (well-being) and bad (deprivation), of one\u2019s income situation. However, this is not always the case, and country-specific variations do exist. In analyzing the causes of the 2 forms of nonconformanc-namely, adaptation (satisfaction paradox) and dissonance (dissatisfaction dilemma)-this paper concludes that sociodemographic and socioeconomic determinants alone cannot account for discrepancies. The consideration of certain social-psychological influences or personality traits and especially social comparison processes (namely, with one\u2019s past) is essential in explaining both the satisfaction paradox and the dissatisfaction dilemma.",

We aimed to comprehensibly investigate MIS adoption across different surgical procedures over 20 years, identify predictors for MIS amenability and compare propensity score-matched outcomes among MIS and open surgery.\r\n\r\nMethods: Nationwide retrospective analysis of all hospitalizations in Switzerland between 1998 and 2017. Appendectomies (n = 186,929), cholecystectomies (n = 57,788), oncological right (n = 9138) and left hemicolectomies (n = 21,580), rectal resections (n = 13,989) and gastrectomies for carcinoma (n = 6606) were included. Endpoints were assessment of temporal MIS implementation, identification of predictors for MIS access and comparison of propensity score-matched outcomes among MIS and open surgery.\r\n\r\nResults: The rates of MIS increased for all procedures during the study period (p \u2264 0.001). While half of all appendectomies were performed laparoscopically by 2005, minimally invasive oncological colorectal resections reached 50% only by 2016. Multivariate analyses identified older age (p \u2264 0.02, except gastrectomy), higher comorbidities (p \u2264 0.001, except rectal resections), lack of private insurance (p \u2264 0.01) as well as rural residence (p \u2264 0.01) with impaired access to MIS. Rural residence correlated with low income regions (p \u2264 0.001), which themselves were associated with decreased MIS access. Geographical mapping confirmed strong disparities for rural and low-income areas in MIS access. Matched outcome analyses revealed benefits of MIS for length of stay, decreased surgical site infection rates for MIS appendectomies and cholecystectomies and higher mortality for open cholecystectomies. No consistent morbidity or mortality benefit for MIS compared to open colorectal resections was observed.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Unequal access to MIS exists in disfavor of older and more comorbid patients and those lacking private insurance, living in rural areas, and having lower income. Efforts should be made to ensure equal MIS access regardless of socioeconomic or geographical factors.",

Among 156 patients with SAH, 21 patients were treated with mild hypothermia (33.0 to 34.0 degrees C) combined with barbiturate coma because of severe brain edema and elevated intracranial pressure (>15 mm Hg) after early aneurysm clipping. Hypothermia was sustained for at least 24 hours after maintaining an intracranial pressure of <15 mm Hg. Nine patients were treated for <72 hours (group 1: mean 42.2 hours, range 8-66 hours) and 12 for >72 hours (group 2: mean 153.9 hours, range 78-400 hours). Three patients (14%) died during the hypothermia treatment. Good functional outcome after 3 months (Glasgow Outcome Score 4-5) was achieved in 10 patients (48%). The outcome did not differ between the two groups. All patients developed severe infections. In group 2 the mean value of minimal leukocyte counts during hypothermia was significantly lower (6.9 vs. 11.8 x 109/L; P = 0.001), and thrombocytopenia (<150 x 109/L) occurred significantly more often (48 vs. 33%; P = 0.032). In 48% of patients with poor-grade SAH, good functional outcome was achieved with combined mild hypothermia and barbiturate coma after early aneurysm surgery. This may be a feasible treatment even for longer than 72 hours. All patients developed severe infections as potentially hazardous side effects. To determine whether mild hypothermia alone is effective in the treatment of severe SAH patients, controlled studies to compare the effects of barbiturate coma alone, mild hypothermia alone, and combined barbiturate coma with hypothermia are needed.",

Of these, 24 patients experienced intracranial hemorrhage during or after the procedure. Fourteen patients were demonstrated to have massive intraparenchymal hematomas and deteriorated to a comatose state (Glasgow Come Scale score < or =6). Twelve patients underwent craniotomy within 170 minutes of being diagnosed with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The surgical procedures performed were hematoma evacuation with total (6 patients) or partial (2 patients) resection of the AVM or hematoma evacuation only (4 patients). The clinical records of these 12 patients were analyzed retrospectively.\r\n\r\nResults: Nine patients recovered to a favorable condition (good recovery, four patients; moderately disabled, five patients), one patient remained in a persistent vegetative state, and two patients died. The interval between hemorrhage and emergency craniotomy was significantly shorter in patients with favorable outcomes than in those with poor clinical outcomes. Advanced age and a larger volume of intraoperative blood loss were the factors relevant to poor outcome. Temporal lobe location of the AVM and incomplete embolization tended to correlate to poor clinical outcome, but this correlation was not statistically significant. The sizes of the AVM and the hematoma did not correlate to patient outcome. There was no difference in outcomes with regard to the surgical procedure performed.\r\n\r\nConclusion: In patients with massive postembolization hematomas, emergency craniotomy should be performed as soon as possible to achieve a favorable outcome. Cooperation among interventional neuroradiologists, intensive care physicians, and neurosurgeons is essential to manage AVM patients with critical postembolization hemorrhage. There is no need to persist in performing simultaneous total resection of the AVM at the emergency craniotomy.",

The importance of monitoring subjective measures of functioning and disability, such as the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), is important as dcSSc is rated by patients as worse than diabetes or hemodialysis for quality of life impairment. This European Scleroderma Trials and Research (EUSTAR) database analysis was undertaken to examine the importance of impaired functionality in dcSSc prognosis. The primary objectives were to identify predictors of death and HAQ-DI score progression over 1\u2009year. HAQ-DI score, major advanced organ involvement, and death rate were also used to develop a comprehensive model to predict lifetime dcSSc progression.\r\nMETHODS: This was an observational, longitudinal study in patients with dcSSc registered in EUSTAR. Death and HAQ-DI scores were, respectively, analyzed by Cox regression and linear regression analyses in relation to baseline covariates. A microsimulation Markov model was developed to estimate/predict natural progression of dcSSc over a patient's lifetime.\r\nRESULTS: The analysis included dcSSc patients with (N\u2009=\u2009690) and without (N\u2009=\u20094132) HAQ-DI score assessments from the EUSTAR database. Baseline HAQ-DI score, corticosteroid treatment, and major advanced organ involvement were predictive of death on multivariable analysis; a 1-point increase in baseline HAQ-DI score multiplied the risk of death by 2.7 (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001) and multiple advanced major organ involvement multiplied the risk of death by 2.8 (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.05). Multivariable analysis showed that baseline modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) and baseline HAQ-DI score were associated with HAQ-DI score progression at 1\u2009year (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.05), but there was no association between baseline organ involvement and HAQ-DI score progression at 1\u2009year. HAQ-DI score, major advanced organ involvement, and death were successfully used to model long-term disease progression in dcSSc.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: HAQ-DI score and major advanced organ involvement were comparable predictors of mortality risk in dcSSc. Baseline mRSS and baseline HAQ-DI score were predictive of HAQ-DI score progression at 1\u2009year, indicating a correlation between these endpoints in monitoring disease progression. It is hoped that this EUSTAR analysis may change physician perception about the importance of the HAQ-DI score in dcSSc.",

The prognosis in this group remains poor and there is an unmet need for new therapeutic options. An emerging class of therapeutics, targeting tumor-specific antigens, are antibodies bound to a cytotoxic agent, known as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The aim of this study was to prioritize ADC targets in HNSCC.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWith a systematic search, we identified 55 different ADC targets currently targeted by registered ADCs and ADCs under clinical evaluation. For these 55 ADC targets, protein overexpression was predicted in a dataset containing 344 HNSCC mRNA expression profiles by using a method called functional genomic mRNA profiling. The ADC target with the highest predicted overexpression was validated by performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) on an independent tissue microarray containing 414 HNSCC tumors.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe predicted top 5 overexpressed ADC targets in HNSCC were: glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB), SLIT and NTRK-like family member 6, epidermal growth factor receptor, CD74 and CD44. IHC validation showed combined cytoplasmic and membranous GPNMB protein expression in 92.0% of the cases. Strong expression was seen in 65.9% of the cases. In addition, 86.5% and 67.7% of cases showed \u22655% and >25% GPNMB positive tumor cells, respectively.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThis study provides a data-driven prioritization of ADCs targets that will facilitate clinicians and drug developers in deciding which ADC should be taken for further clinical evaluation in HNSCC.

An evaluation of the inter-rater reliability of gait quality traits in Franches-Montagnes stallions\nAbstract: Gait quality, that is, the way horses move according to functional and aesthetic principles, englobes many traits that are scored by experts during breeding competitions. The experts can score a trait on a subjective valuating (SV) scale or on a linear profiling (LP) scale representing the biological extremes of the population. However, the reliability of the appraisal of gait quality traits has not been extensively evaluated. In this study, seven breed experts appraised the walk and trot quality of 24 Franches-Montagnes stallions presented in hand on a sand track. Inter-rater reliabilities of six traits (five SV and one LP) at the walk and eight traits (five SV and three LP) at the trot were estimated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The inter-rater reliabilities were poor (ICC < 0.50). The scale anchoring varied between experts, and the variance of scores was low. There were no systematic differences in inter-rater reliability between LP and SV traits. Future studies should determine whether the inter-rater reliabilities may be increased by a more precise definition of the scores within each trait to improve the absolute agreement between experts, by a more uniform scale anchoring between experts, and by decreasing the number of scale items. However, considering the inherent limitations of the human eye in observing high-speed movement, the use of a field-applicable kinematic measurement system may support breeding experts in the appraisal of gait quality traits in the future.",

A composite score was calculated to reflect overall executive function abilities. To assess behavioral problems, parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Mediation analysis was applied to quantify the effect of preterm birth on behavioral problems with executive function abilities as a mediating variable.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nExecutive function abilities were poorer in the very preterm compared to the term-born group (d = 0.62, p = .005) and the parents of very preterm children reported more behavioral problems on the SDQ Total Difficulties Score (d = 0.54, p = .01). The effect of birth status on behavioral problems was significantly mediated by executive function abilities while adjusting for age at assessment, sex, and socioeconomic status (F(2, 76) = 6.42, p = .002, R2 = 0.14).\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nResults from this study suggest that the increase in behavioral symptoms in very preterm children at school-age compared to term-born peers may partly be explained by their executive function deficits. These findings highlight the importance of continuously monitoring the development of children born very preterm to provide optimal care as they grow up.",

We designed and validated a new self-administered questionnaire in Farsi (Persian language) to assess public knowledge of medical genetics based on Rogers' framework. This framework divides knowledge into three types of awareness, how-to (practical) and principles knowledge which refer to knowing the existence, proper use, and theoretical principles of an innovation, respectively. We asked consecutive individuals (n\u2009=\u2009306, age\u2009\u2265\u200920\u00a0years) visiting health centers in different regions of Yazd, a city in central Iran, to fill out the questionnaire. After validation, we analyzed 280 of the questionnaires which revealed a high degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.90) and a positive linear relationship among the scores of different knowledge. Our respondents had relatively fair awareness and how-to, but generally poor principles knowledge with statistically significantly better scores in females and those with higher education. We observed tangible strengths in topics such as consanguineous marriage, thalassemia, and hereditary predisposition to diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, and weaknesses in areas such as genetic testing and genetics of cancer. Notably, experience of premarital genetic counseling did not show any significant effect, but having a relative with a genetic disorder was significantly linked to better awareness scores. Our study provides a reliable and self-administered questionnaire for the assessment of public knowledge of medical genetics. Despite revealing important strengths and weaknesses in our population sample, larger scale evaluations in Iran and other developing countries are needed for better understanding of the public knowledge as the prerequisite for designing appropriate educational programs.",

Here, we aimed to (i) investigate characteristics of HRQoL and (ii) evaluate the association between HRQoL and hearing among different types of CMED.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nIn this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we included adult patients undergoing surgical treatment for CMED. Primary outcomes included HRQoL assessed by the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21) and hearing assessed by pure-tone audiometry.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nIn the included 108 patients (51% females), CMED were chronic otitis media (COM) with (n\u2009=\u200946) or without (n\u2009=\u200922) cholesteatoma, persistent mastoid cavity (with [n\u2009=\u200915] or without [n\u2009=\u200910] recurrent cholesteatoma), revision ossiculoplasty for hearing restoration (n\u2009=\u200914), and postinflammatory meatal fibrosis (n\u2009=\u20091). Preoperatively, the mean ZCMEI-21 score showed statistically significant differences among different types of CMED (p\u2009=\u20090.007) with persistent mastoid cavity without cholesteatoma exhibiting the highest score (34.1, SD 7.7) indicating poor HRQoL. At a mean follow-up period of 183 days, no statistically significant differences in the ZCMEI-21 scores among different types of CMED were observed (p\u2009=\u20090.67).\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis study objectifies differences in HRQoL among different types of CMED. In patients with indication for functional surgery only, e.g., persistent mastoid cavity without cholesteatoma, the worst HRQoL was observed. Yet, in these types of CMED, HRQoL guides decision for treatment. Moreover, differences in HRQoL among different types of CMED were not closely associated with hearing, but largely depended on other symptoms, such as discharge or vertigo.",

The recognition of sepsis in children in the emergency department (ED) can be challenging, related to the high prevalence of common febrile infections, poor specificity of discriminating features, and the capacity of children to compensate until advanced stages of shock. Sepsis outcomes are strongly dependent on the timeliness of recognition and treatment, which has led to the successful implementation of quality improvement programs, increasing the reliability of sepsis treatment in many US institutions. We review clinical, laboratory, and technical modalities that can be incorporated into ED practice to facilitate the recognition, treatment, and reassessment of children with suspected sepsis. The 2020 updated pediatric sepsis guidelines are reviewed and framed in the context of ED interventions, including guidelines for antibiotic administration, fluid resuscitation, and the use of vasoactive agents. Despite a large body of literature on pediatric sepsis epidemiology in recent years, the evidence base for treatment and management components remains limited, implying an urgent need for large trials in this field. In conclusion, although the burden and impact of pediatric sepsis remains substantial, progress in our understanding of the disease and its management have led to revised guidelines and the available data emphasizes the importance of local quality improvement programs.",

Participants answered questions regarding risk preferences and management of simulated MS case-scenarios. The SymptoMScreen (SMSS) questionnaire was used to assess the perception of severity from the patients\u00b4 perspective. SQ bias was defined as patients\u2019 preference to maintain the current treatment despite evidence of disease activity. Mixed linear models adjusting for clustering assessed the association of candidate predictors with the outcome of interest.\r\nResults\r\nThe mean age (SD) was 39.1 (9.5) years and 70.6% were women. SQ bias was observed in 74.4% (n=161) participants. Univariate analysis showed that SMSS score was associated with SQ bias (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.07). Mixed linear regression models suggest that for every point increase in SMSS, there was a 4% increase in the likelihood of SQ bias (\u03b2 0.04; 95%CI 0.015-0.06; p<0.002). Among the different symptomatic dimensions included in the SMSS, only vision impairment (\u03b2 0.32; 95%CI 0.05-0.50) and depression (\u03b2 0.29; 95%CI 0.006-0.58) remained associated with SQ bias in the multivariate analysis. There was no association between participants\u2019 risk preferences and SQ bias.\r\nConclusions\r\nUnwillingness to pursue treatments that are more effective is a common phenomenon affecting over 7 out of 10 patients with RRMS. This phenomenon appears to be driven by patients\u2019 negative self-perception of their clinical status.",

We describe a rare case of a patient with pre-existing M184V/I mutation and virological failure on a dolutegravir/lamivudine/abacavir regimen with the emergence of integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance mutations. Additional risk factors, which may have triggered the virological failure, included suboptimal adherence and low nadir CD4+ cell count. This case illustrates that dolutegravir-containing triple-therapy should be prescribed with caution to patients with pre-existing M184V/I mutation and poor efficacy of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone. In addition, this case highlights the need for viral load monitoring in patients on dolutegravir-containing regimens in settings with a high prevalence of the M184V/I mutation such as in low-income countries.",

According to life course theories, the impact of socio-economic disadvantage can accumulate across the life span, leading to worse health in later life. However, the scientific examination of health correlates of CWP in later life and the mediating role of socio-economic factors (SEF) has previously been neglected.\r\nOBJECTIVE: This study examined whether Swiss survivors of CWP, including former Verdingkinder, have poorer health in later life compared to controls, and whether this association is mediated by socio-economic factors: education, income, satisfaction with financial situation, socio-economic status.\r\nPARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Two face-to-face interviews were conducted with N = 257 participants (risk group, RG, n = 132, M$_{AGE}$ = 70.83 years, 58 % male; control group, CG, n = 125, M$_{AGE}$ = 70.6 years, 49 % male).\r\nMETHODS: A broad set of physical health outcomes, stress, well-being, and SEF were assessed with psychometric instruments.\r\nRESULTS: The RG reported more physical illnesses, vascular risk factors, health symptoms, stress, and lower well-being, compared to the CG. Mediation analyses revealed that SEF were relevant mediators for the significant health and stress disparities between groups.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that SEF can play a crucial role in mitigating the negative effects and health impairments in individuals formerly affected by CWP. Public health services and policies that target these SEF could improve current welfare practices by providing opportunities to overcome early-life disadvantage and facilitating healthier life trajectories.",

Delirium in palliative care is largely under-researched, and few studies have systematically assessed key aspects of delirium in elderly, palliative-care patients. METHODS: In this prospective, observational cohort study at a tertiary care center, 229 delirious palliative-care patients stratified by age: <65 (N = 105) and \u226565 years (N = 124), were analyzed with logistic regression models to identify associations with respect to predisposing and precipitating factors. RESULTS: In 88% of the patients, the underlying diagnosis was cancer. Mortality rate and median time to death did not differ significantly between the two age groups. No inter-group differences were detected with respect to gender, care requirements, length of hospital stay, or medical costs. In patients \u226565 years, exclusively predisposing factors were relevant for delirium, including hearing impairment [odds ratio (OR) 3.64; confidence interval (CI) 1.90-6.99; P < 0.001], hypertonia (OR 3.57; CI 1.84-6.92; P < 0.001), and chronic kidney disease (OR 4.84; CI 1.19-19.72; P = 0.028). In contrast, in patients <65 years, only precipitating factors were relevant for delirium, including cerebral edema (OR 0.02; CI 0.01-0.43; P = 0.012). SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrate that death in delirious palliative-care patients occurs irrespective of age. The multifactorial nature and adverse outcomes of delirium across all age in these patients require clinical recognition. Potentially reversible factors should be detected early to prevent or mitigate delirium and its poor survival outcomes.",

Most studies suffer, however, from potential omitted variable bias, as they are based on simple comparisons of mothers who give birth vaginally and those who give birth by cesarean section. We try to overcome this limitation and provide credible causal evidence by using variation in the probability of having a c-section that is arguably unrelated to maternal and fetal characteristics: variation by time of day. Previous literature documents that, while nature distributes births and associated problems uniformly, time-dependent variables related to physicians\u2019 demand for leisure are significant predictors of unplanned c-sections. Using a sample of public hospitals in Spain, we show that the rate of c-sections is higher during the early hours of the night compared to the rest of the day, while mothers giving birth at the different times are similar in observable characteristics. This exogenous variation provides us with a new instrument for type of birth: time of delivery. Our results suggest that non-medically indicated c-sections have a negative and significant impact on newborn health, as measured by Apgar scores, but that the effect is not severe enough to translate into more extreme outcomes.",

        "document": "Title: Taxing the superrich: challenges of a fair tax system\nAbstract: Over the past decades, many developed countries have experienced considerable increases in income and wealth inequality, led by an extraordinary concentration among the very richest swath of households. This has focused policy attention on the superrich. Various political and economic arguments for at least partially offsetting this rise in inequality have been put forward. In particular, politicians have called for increasing the tax burden on rich households, both in the form of higher top rates for existing income taxes as well as new tax levies targeting the superrich. Most prominently, the idea of introducing an annual wealth tax has recently gained attention in the United States.\r\nThis Public Paper provides an overview of the tax situation the superrich currently face and evaluates various reform proposals. We emphasize that the incomes of the superrich are qualitatively different from others. Some are \u201csuperstars,\u201d for whom small differences in talent are magnified into much larger earnings differences, while others work in winner-take-all markets, meaning that their effort to climb the ladder of success reduces the returns to others. Moreover, the discussion about tax rates must be accompanied by attention to the tax base, with a special focus on capital gains, which comprise a large fraction of the taxable income of the superrich. We also review the pros and cons of wealth taxes versus alternative policies that achieve similar objectives. While a dozen OECD countries levied wealth taxes in the recent past, only three retain them at present. Only Switzerland raises a similar fraction of revenue with its wealth tax as the recent U.S. proposals, therefore serving as a useful example.",

Established CVD was defined as \u22651 prior myocardial infarction, PCI, coronary artery bypass operation, stroke, or established peripheral vascular disease. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death or new Q-wave MI at 2-years. The secondary safety endpoint was BARC 3 or 5 bleeding. Exploratory secondary endpoints were the patient-orientated composite endpoint and net adverse clinical events.\r\nRESULTS\r\nAmong the 15,761 patients in this cohort were 6,693 patients (42.5%) with established CVD. Compared to those without established CVD, these patients had significantly higher rates of the primary (5.1 vs. 3.3%, HR1.59[1.36-1.86], p <\u2009.001) and secondary composite endpoints with no significant differences in bleeding. There was a nonsignificant reduction in the primary endpoint in patients with established CVD receiving the experimental treatment (4.6 vs. 5.6%, HR0.82[0.66-1.02], p =\u2009.07). When comparing patients without CVD to those with one or three territories of CVD, the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint increased in unadjusted and adjusted models.\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nThe poorer outcomes in patients with established CVD are not mitigated by prolonged monotherapy with a potent P2Y12 inhibitor suggesting a greater need to focus on modifiable risk factors.",

Multiple exposures during pregnancy and early childhood impact fetal and infant growth and nephrogenesis, which in turn affect the risk of hypertension and kidney disease throughout the life course. Being small for gestational age is the strongest risk predictor for renal programming, but being born preterm, of low birth weight, large for gestational age, or being exposed to gestational diabetes and preeclampsia are also risk markers. This programmed risk could be mitigated by optimization of maternal health before pregnancy, education about healthy lifestyles, and screening of individuals who may have experienced developmental programming, to permit early diagnosis and intervention. Given that millions of babies are born too small, too early, or in complicated pregnancies, increased awareness of programmed risk of hypertension and kidney disease should provide a window of opportunity to reduce the global burden of these conditions across the life course through prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, and education.",

Despite increasing insight into audiovisual language processing, it remains largely unclear how integration of print and speech develops at the neural level during initial learning in the first years of schooling. To investigate this development, 32 healthy, German-speaking children at varying risk for developmental dyslexia (17 typical readers and 15 poor readers) participated in a longitudinal study including behavioral and fMRI measurements in first (T1) and second (T2) grade. We used an implicit audiovisual (AV) non-word target detection task aimed at characterizing differential activation to congruent (AVc) and incongruent (AVi) audiovisual non-word pairs. While children's brain activation did not differ between AVc and AVi pairs in first grade, an incongruency effect (AVi > AVc) emerged in bilateral inferior temporal and superior frontal gyri in second grade. Of note, pseudoword reading performance improvements with time were associated with the development of the congruency effect (AVc > AVi) in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) from first to second grade. Finally, functional connectivity analyses indicated divergent development and reading expertise dependent coupling from the left occipito-temporal and superior temporal cortex to regions of the default mode (precuneus) and fronto-temporal language networks. Our results suggest that audiovisual integration areas as well as their functional coupling to other language areas and areas of the default mode network show a different development in poor vs. typical readers at varying familial risk for dyslexia.",

        "document": "Title: Income inequality, status decline and support for the radical right\nAbstract: Support for the radical right has risen in most Western democracies. Globalization and modernization processes are usually seen as the source of this development, reshaping political conflicts and producing new groups of people that feel \u2018left behind\u2019. However, few studies test how the relatively common trends in globalization shape the variation in the timing and extent of radical right support across countries. Focusing on the economic dimension of the \u2018losers of globalization\u2019 theory, we argue that income inequality is a suitable indicator to measure the extent to which some groups have fallen behind and to capture the fear of decline in material well-being of people not (yet) at the bottom of the income distribution. The relative deterioration in material conditions, we argue further, translates into a lower subjective social status of vulnerable groups who then turn towards the radical right. By cultivating nativism and thus providing non-economic criteria of social status, the radical right becomes more attractive as societies become more unequal. We show evidence for our hypothesis by comparing vote shares for radical right parties in 20 Western democracies between 1980 and 2016. The findings indicate that rising income inequality substantially increases support for the radical right in the long run. In addition, rising inequality translates into lower subjective social status of nontertiary educated men and this process of status decline further contributes to radical right support. Hence, there are both material and non-material linkages between income inequality and radical right support.",

Standardized mean differences (SMD) comparing the effects of exercise and control interventions on sleep quality with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Data from 10 randomized and 2 non-randomized controlled trials, including a total of 690 persons with PD were included. Exercise had a significant positive effect on sleep quality assessed subjectively (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.53; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.16-0.90; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). However, the methodological quality of the studies showing positive effects on sleep quality was significantly poorer than the studies showing no effects. Only one study assessed the impact of exercise on objective sleep quality, showing improvements in sleep efficiency assessed with polysomnography (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.94; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.38-1.50; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

Since reforms were first introduced, many villagers have left Qu\u1ef3nh \u0110\u00f4i to work in cities, industrial zones or to find employment abroad. The migration process has transformed labour structures and supply, leading to changes in household agricultural production across two dimensions. First, renting or exchanging agricultural land has become common between households in Qu\u1ef3nh \u0110\u00f4i, and between Qu\u1ef3nh \u0110\u00f4i villagers and a neighbouring commune. This renting/exchanging of agricultural land has helped redistribute land among households that would otherwise be rich in land and poor in labour, or vice versa. These transactions have not been purely market-based but carried out mainly through verbal agreements dependent on networks of social capital and trust. Second, because many farm labourers have migrated, households require additional human labour for agricultural production. Facing this situation, various forms of labour exchange have emerged. Migration has, therefore, become an important generator of change in farming.",

Early identification by newborn screening (NBS) significantly improves neurologic outcome. It has remained unclear whether recommended therapy, particular low lysine diet, is safe or negatively affects anthropometric long-term outcome. This national prospective, observational, multi-centre study included 79 patients identified by NBS and investigated effects of interventional and non-interventional parameters on body weight, body length, body mass index (BMI) and head circumference as well as neurological parameters. Adherence to recommended maintenance and emergency treatment (ET) had a positive impact on neurologic outcome and allowed normal anthropometric development until adulthood. In contrast, non-adherence to ET, resulting in increased risk of dystonia, had a negative impact on body weight (mean SDS -1.07; P = .023) and body length (mean SDS -1.34; P = -.016). Consistently, longitudinal analysis showed a negative influence of severe dystonia on weight and length development over time (P < .001). Macrocephaly was more often found in female (mean SDS 0.56) than in male patients (mean SDS -0.20; P = .049), and also in individuals with high excreter phenotype (mean SDS 0.44) compared to low excreter patients (mean SDS -0.68; P = .016). In GA1, recommended long-term treatment is effective and allows for normal anthropometric long-term development up to adolescence, with gender- and excreter type-specific variations. Delayed ET and severe movement disorder result in poor anthropometric outcome.",

Premature and low birth weight neonates have a higher risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH). There are minimal data regarding IVH in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to examine the incidence, severity and timing of and modifiable risk factors for IVH amongst low-birth-weight neonates in Uganda.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nThis is a prospective cohort study of neonates with birthweights of \u22642000\u2009g admitted to a neonatal unit (NU) in a regional referral hospital in eastern Uganda. Maternal data were collected from interviews and medical records. Neonates had cranial ultrasound (cUS) scans on the day of recruitment and days 3, 7 and 28 after birth. Risk factors were tabulated and are presented alongside odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for IVH incidence. Outcomes included incidence, timing and severity of IVH and 28-day survival.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOverall, 120 neonates were recruited. IVH was reported in 34.2% of neonates; 19.2% had low grade (Papile grades 1-2) and 15% had high grade (Papile grades 3-4). Almost all IVH (90.2%) occurred by day 7, including 88.9% of high grade IVH. Of those with known outcomes, 70.4% (81/115) were alive on day 28 and survival was not associated with IVH. We found that vaginal delivery, gestational age (GA) <\u200932\u2009weeks and resuscitation in the NU increased the odds of IVH. Of the 6 neonates who received 2 doses of antenatal steroids, none had IVH.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn this resource limited NU in eastern Uganda, more than a third of neonates born weighing \u22642000\u2009g had an IVH and the majority of these occurred by day 7. We found that vaginal birth, earlier gestation and need for resuscitation after admission to the NU increased the risk of IVH. This study had a high rate of SGA neonates and the risk factors and relationship of these factors with IVH in this setting needs further investigation. The role of antenatal steroids in the prevention of IVH in LICs also needs urgent exploration.",

Although screening methods for PCa have substantially improved, the outcome for patients with advanced PCa remains poor. The elucidation of the molecular mechanism that drives the progression from a slow-growing, organ-confined tumor to a highly invasive and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) is therefore important. We have already proved the diagnostic potential of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) when detected in urine of individuals at risk of developing PCa. The aim of this study was to implement IDO as a prognostic marker for PCa patients undergoing surgical treatment. We have thus conducted an observational study by collecting 100 urine samples from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy as first treatment of choice. To test the integrity of our investigation, scale dilution cells of an established PC3 cell line were added to urine of healthy donors and used for gene expression analysis by a TaqMan assay on the catalytic part of IDO mRNA. Our data show that the quantification of IDO mRNA in urine of patients has a very promising ability to identify patients at high risk of cancer advancement, as defined by Gleason score. Our goal is to lay the groundwork to develop a superior test for PCa. The data generated are thus necessary (i) to strengthen the IDO-based diagnostic/prognostic test and (ii) to provide patients and clinicians with an affordable and easy screening test.",

Patients were stratified into 3 groups having either no HLA antibodies at all (NoAB), HLA antibodies with donor specificity (DSA) and HLA antibodies without donor specificity (NonDSA).

This study assessed the inter-observer agreement of histological grading in a series of ILBC and LN.\r\n\r\n54 cases (36x ILBC, 18x LN) were evaluated by 17 observers. 3978 classification calls on various histological features, including nuclear grade, proliferative activity (Ki67 immunohistochemistry, categorical scoring), histological grade and pleomorphism were obtained. Pairwise Cohen\u2019s kappa values were calculated and compared between various features and different observer subsets with variable histomorphological experience.\r\n\r\nIn ILBC, pairwise inter-observer agreement for histological grade ranged from poor to almost perfect concordance and was higher in advanced and experienced histopathologists compared with beginners (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Agreement for proliferation (Ki67) ranged from slight to almost perfect concordance and was also higher in advanced and experienced histopathologists (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Considering different features, agreement for proliferation (Ki67) was superior to agreement for histological grade and nuclear grade, even among advanced and experienced histopathologists (P\u2009<\u20090.001). In LN, agreement for B-classification ranged from poor to almost perfect concordance and was higher in advanced and experienced histopathologists (P\u2009<\u20090.001).

However, the role of nutritional and lifestyle factors in T regulation and production remains unclear. The objectives are to comprehensively test the cross-sectional associations of nutritional and lifestyle factors with T deficiency and to validate the associations in the NHANES survey.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWe performed weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the association of 173 nutritional and lifestyle factors with T deficiency (total testosterone \u2264\u20093.5\u00a0ng/mL) in NHANES III as the discovery set (mean age 41). We controlled for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate (FDR)\u2009<\u20095% and replicated in NHANES 1999-2004 (mean age 44).\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nWe identified seven nutritional factors as being inversely associated with T deficiency in NHANES 1999-2004, namely dietary intake of vitamin A, protein, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, total fats, saturated fatty acid 16:0, and phosphorus. In a multivariable model, only vitamin A intake remained significantly associated with T deficiency (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99). Principal component analysis suggested that the two principal components, (1) dietary fats, protein, and phosphorous and (2) total vitamin A, may be associated with T deficiency.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOur systematic evaluation provided new insight into the modifiable factors that could play a role in the regulation of T production. This study has the potential to contribute to the current body of literature which seeks to formulate a clinical definition of T deficiency after taking into account nutritional and lifestyle factors.",

At relapse after platinum-based chemotherapy, single-agent chemotherapy is commonly used and single-arm trials of immune-checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated encouraging activity.\r\n\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\r\n\r\nPROMISE-meso is an open-label 1:1 randomised phase III trial investigating the efficacy of pembrolizumab (200 mg/Q3W) versus institutional choice single-agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine or vinorelbine) in relapsed MPM patients with progression after/on previous platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were performance status 0-1 and unselected for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. At progression, patients randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy were allowed to crossover to pembrolizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), investigator-assessed PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Efficacy by PD-L1 status was investigated in exploratory analyses.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nBetween September 2017 and August 2018, 144 patients were randomly allocated (pembrolizumab: 73;\u00a0chemotherapy: 71). At data cut-off [20 February 2019, median follow-up of 11.8 months (interquartile range: 9.9-14.5)], 118 BICR-PFS events were observed. No difference in BICR-PFS was detected [hazard ratio\u00a0= 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.53; P\u00a0= 0.76], and median BICR-PFS (95% CI) for pembrolizumab was 2.5 (2.1-4.2), compared with 3.4 (2.2-4.3) months for chemotherapy. A difference in ORR for pembrolizumab was identified (22%, 95% CI: 13% to 33%), over chemotherapy (6%, 95% CI: 2% to 14%; P\u00a0= 0.004). Forty-five patients (63%) assigned to chemotherapy received pembrolizumab at progression. With follow-up to 21 August 2019 [17.5 months: (14.8-19.7)], no difference in OS was detected between groups (HR\u00a0= 1.12, 95% CI: 0.74-1.69; P\u00a0= 0.59), even after adjusting for crossover. Pembrolizumab safety was consistent with previous observations. Exploratory efficacy analyses by PD-L1 status demonstrated no improvements in ORR/PFS/OS.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThis is the first randomised trial evaluating the efficacy of pembrolizumab in MPM patients progressing after/on previous platinum-based chemotherapy. In biologically unselected patients, although associated with an improved ORR, pembrolizumab improves neither PFS nor OS over single-agent chemotherapy.",

All patients underwent the surgical procedure between January 2015 and December 2016 at the Department of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery at Universit\u00e4tsSpital Z\u00fcrich and were included in a previous functional outcome study.\u00a0The surgical results were analyzed and graded as poor, acceptable, or good. The examiners declared whether they would have made any intraoperative revisions if the radiologic information had been available. Finally, the examiners estimated the required duration of elastic intermaxillary fixation (IMF) from the radiologic images, which was compared with the actual duration.\r\nRESULTS\r\nFracture reduction was classified as good in 33 cases (82.5%), acceptable in 5 cases, and poor in 2 cases by one examiner and as good in 32 cases (80%), acceptable in 6 cases, and poor in 2 cases by the other examiner. The inter-rater reliability was determined to be good (Cohen \u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.92). Correct osteosynthesis placement was found in 19 cases by one examiner and in 21 cases by the other examiner, with good inter-rater reliability (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.8). Moderate inter-rater reliability (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.4) was found for the required duration of elastic IMF. Furthermore, the estimated elastic IMF duration matched the actual duration in fewer than half of the cases.\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nIt is feasible to achieve reliably good radiologic results when operating on condylar process fractures by a transoral approach with endoscopic assistance and angled instruments. Intraoperative 3-dimensional imaging enables instant quality control and prompts surgical revision if needed.",

According the time-based resource-sharing (TBRS) theory, people refresh the contents of working memory sequentially at high speed. We measured the speed of refreshing by asking participants to sequentially refresh a small set of items in sync with a metronome, and to adjust the metronome to the fastest speed at which they could refresh. Refreshing speeds converged on about 0.2 s per item for several verbal and visual materials. This time was shorter than the speed of articulatory rehearsal measured with the same method, and \u2013 in contrast to rehearsal \u2013 did not depend on word length. We sought evidence for people refreshing in sync with the metronome by presenting recognition probes at unpredictable times. We expected that probes matching the just-refreshed item should be recognized faster and more accurately than probes matching other items. This was not the case. A parallel experiment with overt articulatory rehearsal showed poor synchronization of rehearsal with the metronome, suggesting by analogy that refreshing was equally out of sync. The results support the assumption that people can attend sequential to items in working memory, and monitor this process.  This refreshing process is probably faster than rehearsal, but it is unlikely to be possible as fast as the refreshing process assumed in the TBRS theory.",

We hypothesized that in clinical practice, VKAs may be prescribed less frequently to patients with AF and SAMe-TT2R2 scores >2 than to patients with lower scores.\r\nMethods and results\r\n\r\nWe analyzed the Phase III dataset of the Global Registry on Long-Term Oral Antithrombotic Treatment in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (GLORIA-AF), a large, global, prospective global registry of patients with newly diagnosed AF and \u22651 stroke risk factor. We compared baseline clinical characteristics and antithrombotic prescriptions to determine the probability of VKA prescription among anticoagulated patients with baseline SAMe-TT2R2 score >2 and \u22642. Among 17,465 anticoagulated patients with AF, 4,828 (27.6%) were prescribed VKA and 12,637 (72.4%) a NOAC: 11,884 (68.0%) patients had SAMe-TT2R2 scores 0-2 and 5,581 (32.0%) had scores >2.

We conjecture that, holding all else equal, frequent job changes can indicate poor work attitude and that this information is transmitted through employment histories. We find support for this hypothesis across three studies that employ complementary laboratory, field, and survey experiments, as well as in labor market panel data. First, a tightly controlled laboratory labor market experiment demonstrates that prior employment information allows employers to screen for reliable and cooperative workers and that these workers obtain better employment outcomes. Secondly, we conduct a field experiment that varies the frequency of job changes in applicants\u2019 resumes and find that those with fewer job changes receive substantially more callbacks from prospective employers. Thirdly, a survey experiment with human resources professionals confirms that the resume manipulations in the field study create different perceptions of work attitude and that these largely account for the callback differences. Finally, we find evidence consistent with our hypothesized relationships in empirical labor market data. Our work highlights the potential importance of job history as a signal of work attitude in labor markets, and points to a potential cost of frequent job changes.",

Intra-European disparities are reported for early detection and prognosis of skin cancers, however, no information exists about regional variation in patterns of dermoscopy use across Europe. Objective: To evaluate the regional differences in patterns of dermoscopy use and training among European dermatologists. Materials & Methods:An online survey of European-registered dermatologists regarding dermoscopy training, practice and attitudes was established. Answers from Eastern (EE) versus Western European (WE) countries were compared and their correlation with their respective countries\u2019 gross domestic product/capita (GDPc) and total and government health expenditure/capita (THEc and GHEc) was analysed. Results: We received 4,049 responses from 14 WE countries and 3,431 from 18 EE countries. A higher proportion of WE respondents reported dermoscopy use (98% vs. 77%, p<0.001) and training during residency (43% vs. 32%) or anytime (96.5% vs. 87.6%) (p<0.001) compared to EE respondents. The main obstacles in dermoscopy use were poor access to dermoscopy equipment in EE and a lack of confidence in one's skills in WE. GDPc, THEc and GHEc correlated with rate of dermoscopy use and dermoscopy training during residency (Spearman rho: 0.5-0.7, p<0.05), and inversely with availability of dermoscopy equipment. Conclusion: The rates and patterns of dermoscopy use vary significantly between Western and Eastern Europe, on a background of economic inequality. Regionally adapted interventions to increase access to dermoscopy equipment and training might enhance the use of this technique towards improving the early detection of skin cancers.",

Recent molecular studies have resulted in the discovery of recurrent driver mutations in many pediatric brain tumors. However, despite these molecular advances, the clinical outcomes of high grade tumors, including H3K27M diffuse midline glioma (H3K27M DMG), remain poor. To address the paucity of tissue for biological studies, we have established a comprehensive protocol for the coordination and processing of donated specimens at postmortem. Since 2010, 60 postmortem pediatric brain tumor donations from 26 institutions were coordinated and collected. Patient derived xenograft models and cell cultures were successfully created (76% and 44% of attempts respectively), irrespective of postmortem processing time. Histological analysis of mid-sagittal whole brain sections revealed evidence of treatment response, immune cell infiltration and the migratory path of infiltrating H3K27M DMG cells into other midline structures and cerebral lobes. Sequencing of primary and disseminated tumors confirmed the presence of oncogenic driver mutations and their obligate partners. Our findings highlight the importance of postmortem tissue donations as an invaluable resource to accelerate research, potentially leading to improved outcomes for children with aggressive brain tumors.",

This study aimed to quantify the contribution to educational inequalities in years with disability of eight risk factors: father's manual occupation, low income, few social contacts, smoking, high alcohol consumption, high body-weight, low physical exercise and low fruit and vegetable consumption.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWe collected register-based mortality and survey-based disability and risk factor data from 15 European countries covering the period 2010-14 for most countries. We calculated years with disability between the ages of 35 and 80 by education and gender using the Sullivan method, and determined the hypothetical effect of changing the prevalence of each risk factor to the prevalence observed among high educated ('upward levelling scenario'), using Population Attributable Fractions.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nYears with disability among low educated were higher than among high educated, with a difference of 4.9\u2009years among men and 5.5\u2009years among women for all countries combined. Most risk factors were more prevalent among low educated. We found the largest contributions to inequalities in years with disability for low income (men: 1.0\u2009year; women: 1.4\u2009year), high body-weight (men: 0.6\u2009year; women: 1.2\u2009year) and father's manual occupation (men: 0.7\u2009year; women: 0.9\u2009year), but contributions differed by country. The contribution of smoking was relatively small.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nDisadvantages in material circumstances (low income), circumstances during childhood (father's manual occupation) and high body-weight contribute to inequalities in years with disability.",

Conceptual work has shown that these symptoms can be mapped onto, at least, two distinct dimensions: apathy including the domains avolition, asociality and anhedonia, and diminished expression including the domains blunted affect and alogia. Growing evidence suggest that these dimensions have partly distinct behavioral, cognitive and neural correlates. Nonetheless, modulation and treatment of specific processes and brain correlates related to these negative symptom dimensions through behavioral, pharmacological, and brain stimulation interventions remains poorly understood. Here, we address this question by employing an integrative approach and comprehensively synthesizing the current literature on neuroimaging, behavior and clinical studies of both negative symptom dimensions. While considerable progress has been made, it remains an open challenge to develop integrative mechanistic pathophysiological models for apathy and diminished expression. We conclude that such multi-level frameworks are key for the development of new biological and psychosocial treatments and may advance progress towards an individualized treatment of negative symptoms.",

There is evidence for aberrant cortico-striatal function and connectivity as neural substrate of avolition and anhedonia. However, it remains unclear how both relate to shared or distinct striatal coupling with large-scale intrinsic networks. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) this study investigated the association of large-scale cortico-striatal functional connectivity with self-reported and clinician-rated avolition and anhedonia in subjects with schizophrenia.\r\nMethods: Seventeen subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) and 28 healthy controls (HC) underwent rs-fMRI. Using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), we assessed Independent Components (ICs) reflecting intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), intra intrinsic functional connectivity within the ICs (intra-iFC), and intrinsic functional connectivity between different ICs (inter-iFC). Avolition and anhedonia were assessed using the Self Evaluation Scale for Negative Symptoms and the Brief Negative Symptom Scale.\r\nResults: ICA revealed three striatal components and six cortical ICNs. Both self-rated avolition and anhedonia correlated with increased inter-iFC between the caudate and posterior Default Mode Network (pDMN) and between the caudate and Central Executive Network (CEN). In contrast, clinician-rated avolition and anhedonia were not correlated with cortico-striatal connectivity. Group comparison revealed trend-wise decreased inter-iFC between the caudate and Salience Network (SN) in schizophrenia patients compared to HC.\r\nDiscussion: Self-rated, but not clinician-rated, avolition and anhedonia was associated with aberrant striatal coupling with the default mode and the central executive network. These findings suggest that self-reported and clinician-rated scores might capture different aspects of motivational and hedonic deficits in schizophrenia and therefore relate to different cortico-striatal functional abnormalities.",

We aimed to explore perceptions towards PA in LTx recipients with CF to better understand individuals' needs and preferences.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nParticipants completed an online survey at two Swiss LTx and one follow-up shared care centre between June and December 2018.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOne hundred and eleven individuals completed the survey (87.4% response rate). Overall, survey participants perceive PA as important for their daily life and health. Perceived motives of PA were improving muscle strength, endurance and quality of life (QoL), to feel better, fun, to achieve personal goals and having more energy for everyday life. Fatigue was the most common perceived barrier to PA and associated with poorer QoL (r = -0.43, p<0.001) and health status (r = -0.31, p = 0.001). Participants with lung allograft dysfunction (LAD, n = 20) reported lower habitual PA (p = 0.009) and health status (p = 0.011), and rated shortness of breath, bad weather and concerns regarding lung rejection higher than those without LAD (all p<0.05). When we asked how an optimal training programme should look like, the majority would prefer individual, non-supervised (60%), outdoor (77%), endurance training (90%), once or twice a week (47%) for 40-60 minutes (48%). Only a minority of patients (14%) would be willing to use exercise applications for their home-based training.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nLTx recipients with CF value PA as important for their health. People with CF should be encouraged individually by their multidisciplinary transplant team to implement PA in their daily life, potential barriers should be identified and addressed. Overall, knowledge on perceived barriers and motives for PA should be considered in the development of future patient-centred PA programmes.",

Yet, little is known about the link between brain volumes and cognitive function in adults with congenital heart disease. Forty-four patients and 53 controls between 18 and 32 years underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing, assessed with an intelligence quotient and executive function global score. Associations between brain volumes and cognitive function were calculated using linear models. Cognitive function in patients was within the normal range (intelligence quotient: 97.74 (10.76)). Total brain volume was significantly smaller in patients compared to controls (1067.26 (113.53) vs 1113.04 (97.88) cm3, P < 0.01), irrespective of cardiac factors (heart defect complexity, cyanosis, cardiopulmonary bypass: all P > 0.4). After adjusting for total brain volume, only corpus callosum volume remained significantly smaller (P = 0.03). Smaller total brain volume was associated with poorer overall executive functioning (P = 0.02) and inhibition (P < 0.01), in both patients and controls. The association between total brain volume and overall executive functioning was moderated by parental socioeconomic status (lower socioeconomic status was associated with a stronger association between brain volume and EF; interaction P = 0.03). In adults with congenital heart disease, despite normal intelligence quotient, brain volume alterations persist into adulthood and are related to executive functioning, in particular inhibitory control. Adults coming from low socioeconomic background and with altered brain volumes are especially vulnerable and should thus be followed-up during adulthood to ensure optimal social and educational support.\r\n\r\nKeywords: ACHD; Brain imaging; Brain volume; Congenital heart disease; Executive function.",

Combined with unique administrative data from Ecuador, our approach yields measures of individual-level exposure to exports and imports, for both capital and labor income, as well as estimates of the incidence of such exposure across the income distribution. We find that international trade raises earnings inequality in Ecuador, especially in the upper-half of the income distribution.

In EOC patients where upfront surgery is contraindicated for medical reasons (e.g., comorbidities or poor performance status), or where complete cytoreduction cannot be achieved, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to interval debulking surgery (IDS), and adjuvant chemotherapy is an alternative therapeutic option. There is currently a lack of consensus about who are the best candidates to receive NACT, and some authors have even suggested that this approach could be harmful in a subset of patients via promotion of early chemoresistance. Standard and novel imaging techniques together with a better molecular characterization of the disease have the potential to improve selection of patients, but ultimately well designed randomised clinical trials are needed to guide treatment decisions in this setting. The advent of new and effective treatment options (antiangiogenics and PARP inhibitors), now approved for use in the first line and relapse settings has opened the way to clinical trials aiming to investigate these agents as substitute or in addition to chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in molecularly selected EOC patients. Here, we will review the evidence supporting the use of NACT in newly diagnosed EOCs, data highlighting the importance of its use in selected patients, new imaging methodologies and biomarkers that can guide patient selection.",

Preoperative virtual planning has mainly focused on glenoid component placement. Such planning also has the potential to improve anatomic\u00a0positioning of the humeral head by more accurately guiding the humeral head cut\u00a0and aid in the selection of anatomic humeral component sizing. It was hypothesized that the use of preoperative 3-dimensional (3D) planning helps to reliably achieve RPHA after stemless TSA.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nOne hundred consecutive stemless TSA (67 males, 51 right shoulder, mean age of 62 \u00b19.4 years) were radiographically assessed using pre- and postoperative standardized anteroposterior radiographs. The RPHA was measured with the so-called circle method described by Youderian et\u00a0al. We measured deviation from the premorbid center of rotation (COR), and more than 3 mm was considered as minimal clinically important difference. Additionally, pre- and postoperative humeral head diameter (HHD), head-neck angle (HNA), and humeral head height (HHH) were measured to assess additional geometrical risk factors for poor RPHA.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe mean distance from of the premorbid to the implanted head COR was 4.3\u00a0\u00b1 3.1 mm. Thirty-five shoulders (35%) showed a deviation of less than 3 mm (mean 1.9\u00a0\u00b11.1) and 65 shoulders (65%) a deviation of \u22653 mm (mean 8.0 \u00b1 3.7). Overstuffing was the main reason for poor RPHA (88%). The level of the humeral head cut was responsible for overstuffing in 46 of the 57 overstuffed cases. The preoperative HHD, HHH, and HNA were significantly larger, higher, and more in valgus angulation in the group with accurate RPHA compared with the group with poor RPHA (HHD of 61.1 mm \u00b1 4.4 vs. 55.9 \u00b1 6.6, P < .001; HHH 8.6\u00b12.2 vs. 7.6\u00b12.6, P\u00a0= .026; and varus angulation of 134.7\u00b0 \u00b16.4\u00b0 vs. 131.0\u00b0 \u00b17.91, P = .010).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nRestoration of proximal humeral anatomy after stemless TSA using computed tomography (CT)-based 3D planning was not precise. A poorly performed humeral head cut was the main reason for overstuffing, which was seen in 88% of the cases with inaccurate RPHA. Preoperative small HHD, low HHH, and varus-angulated HNA are risk factors for poor RPHA after stemless TSA.",

The term neglect describes a behavior that deviates from an ideal norm. However, both the form of this ideal norm and the definition of deviation depend on contemporary discourses and scientific positions. Historically, it has been more frequently poor families and single mothers who have been disciplined for child neglect by the state, whilst their economic situation was marginalized. Parallel current findings raise questions regarding how these discourses form, how they influence decision-making processes, and whether a continuity can be ascertained in measures of social disciplining. Our ongoing research project on welfare practice in response of child neglect aims to reconstruct and analyze current discourses on family, childrearing, and motherhood in the context of child neglect. Taking a multi-perspectival approach, it will analyze and compare the expert discourse, the political/public discourse, and the perspective of affected mothers across two different time periods in five selected Swiss cantons. Preliminary findings indicate that gender categories, especially motherhood, continue to be of great importance. On the basis of a first analysis of casefiles, one could speak of a \u201cmotherism\u201d: in case processing and in the course of the case, responsibility is attributed to the mother, and social and pedagogical contexts are neglected, even the financial situation seems to be given less importance. Instead, the willingness to cooperate often seems to be a key factor in deciding on further interventions. Furthermore, there are indications that in decision-making processes with far-reaching consequences, legal arguments are preferred while childrearing aspects are neglected. It can also be noted that normative and sometimes stigmatizing statements do not seem to belong to the past. In this article, we will give insight into the research design and first findings and discuss the necessity of reflecting on the images of family, childrearing, and motherhood in light of the rapid social changes in the spheres of family, motherhood, and fatherhood.",

In monofollicular IVF, the effect of flushing has so far been addressed by two studies: (i) a prospective study with minimal stimulation IVF demonstrated an increased oocyte yield, and (ii) a retrospective study with natural cycle (NC)-IVF showed an increased oocyte yield and an increased transfer rate.\r\n\r\nStudy design, size, duration: Randomized controlled trial including 164 women who were randomized for either aspiration with or without flushing from 2016 to 2019.\r\n\r\nParticipants/materials, setting, methods: Infertile women 18-42 years of age with an indication for IVF treatment at a university-based infertility unit. Women undergoing monofollicular IVF were randomized to either follicular aspiration only or follicular aspiration directly followed by five follicular flushes at a 1:1 ratio. The intervention was done without anaesthesia, using a gauge 19 single-lumen needle. Flushing volume was calculated (sphere formula) based on the size of the follicle.\r\n\r\nMain results and the role of chance: A total of 164 women were included; 81 were allocated to 'aspiration only' and 83 to additional 'flushing'. Primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat: oocyte yield, defined as the collected mature oocyte rate, was higher (n = 64/83, 77.1%) in the flushing group compared to the aspiration only group (n = 48/81, 59.3%, adjusted risk difference (RD): 18.2% (95% CI 3.9-31.7%), P-value = 0.02). In the flushing group, most oocytes were retrieved within the first three flushes (63/83, 75.8%). Fertilization rate was higher in the flushing group (n = 53/83, 63.9% vs n = 38/81, 46.9%; adjusted RD: 16.8% (96% CI 1.5-31.4%), P = 0.045). Transfer rate was also higher in the flushing group (n = 52/83, 62.7% vs n = 38/81, 46.9%; RD: 15.71 (95% CI 0.3-30.3%)), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.06). The clinical pregnancy rate n = 9/83 versus n = 9/81 (RD: -0.3% (95% CI -9.9% to 9.5%)) and live birth rate n = 7/83 versus n = 8/81 (RD: -1.5% (95% CI -10.4% to 7.1%)) were not significantly different between the flushing and the aspiration group. The median duration of the intervention was significantly longer with flushing (2.38 min; quartiles 2.0, 2.7) versus aspiration only (0.43 min; quartiles 0.3, 0.5) (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the mean (\u00b1SD) visual analogue scales pain score between the follicular flushing (3.4 \u00b1 1.8) and the aspiration group (3.1 \u00b1 1.89).",

        "document": "Title: Urine steroid metabolomics for the differential diagnosis of adrenal incidentalomas in the EURINE-ACT study: a prospective test validation study\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nCross-sectional imaging regularly results in incidental discovery of adrenal tumours, requiring exclusion of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). However, differentiation is hampered by poor specificity of imaging characteristics. We aimed to validate a urine steroid metabolomics approach, using steroid profiling as the diagnostic basis for ACC.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWe did a prospective multicentre study in adult participants (age \u226518 years) with newly diagnosed adrenal masses. We assessed the accuracy of diagnostic imaging strategies based on maximum tumour diameter (\u22654 cm vs <4 cm), imaging characteristics (positive vs negative), and urine steroid metabolomics (low, medium, or high risk of ACC), separately and in combination, using a reference standard of histopathology and follow-up investigations. With respect to imaging characteristics, we also assessed the diagnostic utility of increasing the unenhanced CT tumour attenuation threshold from the recommended 10 Hounsfield units (HU) to 20 HU.\r\n\r\nFINDINGS\r\n\r\nOf 2169 participants recruited between Jan 17, 2011, and July 15, 2016, we included 2017 from 14 specialist centres in 11 countries in the final analysis. 98 (4\u00b79%) had histopathologically or clinically and biochemically confirmed ACC. Tumours with diameters of 4 cm or larger were identified in 488 participants (24\u00b72%), including 96 of the 98 with ACC (positive predictive value [PPV] 19\u00b77%, 95% CI 16\u00b72-23\u00b75). For imaging characteristics, increasing the unenhanced CT tumour attenuation threshold to 20 HU from the recommended 10 HU increased specificity for ACC (80\u00b70% [95% CI 77\u00b79-82\u00b70] vs 64\u00b70% [61\u00b74-66.4]) while maintaining sensitivity (99\u00b70% [94\u00b74-100\u00b70] vs 100\u00b70% [96\u00b73-100\u00b70]; PPV 19\u00b77%, 16\u00b73-23\u00b75). A urine steroid metabolomics result indicating high risk of ACC had a PPV of 34\u00b76% (95% CI 28\u00b76-41\u00b70). When the three tests were combined, in the order of tumour diameter, positive imaging characteristics, and urine steroid metabolomics, 106 (5\u00b73%) participants had the result maximum tumour diameter of 4 cm or larger, positive imaging characteristics (with the 20 HU cutoff), and urine steroid metabolomics indicating high risk of ACC, for which the PPV was 76\u00b74% (95% CI 67\u00b72-84\u00b71). 70 (3\u00b75%) were classified as being at moderate risk of ACC and 1841 (91\u00b73%) at low risk (negative predictive value 99\u00b77%, 99\u00b74-100\u00b70).\r\n\r\nINTERPRETATION\r\n\r\nAn unenhanced CT tumour attenuation cutoff of 20 HU should replace that of 10 HU for exclusion of ACC. A triple test strategy of tumour diameter, imaging characteristics, and urine steroid metabolomics improves detection of ACC, which could shorten time to surgery for patients with ACC and help to avoid unnecessary surgery in patients with benign tumours.\r\n\r\nFUNDING\r\n\r\nEuropean Commission, UK Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust, and UK National Institute for Health Research, US National Institutes of Health, the Claire Khan Trust Fund at University Hospitals Birmingham Charities, and the Mayo Clinic Foundation for Medical Education and Research.",

Because of inadequate methods in published systematic reviews, the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension and associated risks of poor outcomes in Covid-19 patients are unknown. We searched databases from December 1, 2019, to April 6, 2020, and selected observational peer-reviewed studies in English of patients with Covid-19. Independent reviewers extracted data on study participants, interventions, and outcomes and assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence. We included 65 (15 794 participants) observational studies at moderate to high risk of bias. Overall prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 12% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10-15; n = 12 870; I 2: 89%), and 17% (95% CI, 13-22; n = 12 709; I 2: 95%), respectively. In severe Covid-19, the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension were 18% (95% CI, 16-20; n = 1099; I 2: 0%) and 32% (95% CI, 16-54; n = 1078; I 2: 63%), respectively. Unadjusted relative risk for intensive care unit admission and mortality were 1.96 (95% CI, 1.19-3.22; n = 8890; I 2: 80%; P = .008) and 2.78 (95% CI, 1.39-5.58; n = 2058; I 2: 75%; P = .0004) for diabetics; and 2.95 (95% CI, 2.18-3.99; n = 1737; I 2: 0%; P < .001) and 2.39 (95% CI, 1.54-3.73; n = 3107; I 2: 66%; P < .001) for hypertensives. Neither diabetes (1.50; 95% CI, 0.90-2.50; n = 1991; I 2: 74%; P = .119) nor hypertension (1.48; 95% CI, 0.99-2.23; n = 2023; I 2: 69%; P = .058) was associated with severe Covid-19. In conclusion, the risk of intensive care unit admission and mortality for patients with diabetes or hypertension who developed Covid-19 is increased compared with those without these comorbidities.",

PH-COPD subjects were older, predominantly male, and treated mainly with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Despite similar hemodynamic impairment, patients with PH-COPD had a worse 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) and more advanced World Health Organization functional class (WHO FC). Transplant-free survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were higher in the IPAH group than in the PH-COPD group (IPAH 94%, 75%, 55%, vs PH-COPD 86%, 55%, 38%; p=0.004). Risk factors for poor outcomes in PH-COPD were male sex, low 6MWD and high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). In patients with severe PH-COPD, improvements in 6MWD by \u226530m or improvements in WHO FC after initiation of medical therapy were associated with better outcome.\r\nINTERPRETATION: Patients with PH-COPD were functionally more impaired and had a poorer outcome than patients with IPAH. Predictors of death in the PH-COPD group were sex, 6MWD and PVR. Our data raise the hypothesis that some patients with severe PH-COPD may benefit from PH treatment.

There is a large spectrum of CS presentations resulting from the interaction between an acute cardiac insult and a patient's underlying cardiac and overall medical condition. Phenotyping patients with CS may have clinical impact on management because classification would support initiation of appropriate therapies. CS management should consider appropriate organization of the health care services, and therapies must be given to the appropriately selected patients, in a timely manner, whilst avoiding iatrogenic harm. Although several consensus-driven algorithms have been proposed, CS management remains challenging and substantial investments in research and development have not yielded proof of efficacy and safety for most of the therapies tested, and outcome in this condition remains poor. Future studies should consider the identification of the new pathophysiological targets, and high-quality translational research should facilitate incorporation of more targeted interventions in clinical research protocols, aimed to improve individual patient outcomes. Designing outcome clinical trials in CS remains particularly challenging in this critical and very costly scenario in cardiology, but information from these trials is imperiously needed to better inform the guidelines and clinical practice. The goal of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the definition, epidemiology, underlying causes, pathophysiology and management of CS based on important lessons from clinical trials and registries, with a focus on improving in-hospital management.",

Over the last decade cardiovascular outcome trials with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have demonstrated beneficial effects for three SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin) in reducing hospitalisations for HF. More recently, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of worsening HF or death from cardiovascular causes in patients with chronic HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. A number of additional trials in HF patients with reduced and/or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction are ongoing and/or about to be reported.

Follow-up information was obtained via re-admission to the hospital or telephone interview of the referring veterinarian or owner. Outcome was subjectively scored as excellent, good, moderate, or poor based on lameness and function.\r\nResults: Sixteen SHAs were performed in 15 equids (body weight 65-145 kg) by nine different surgeons. A narrow 4.5/5.0 mm LCP (7-16 holes) was used in 14 of the 16 SHAs. Follow-up was collected 2.5 years after surgery (median; range: 9 weeks to 10 years). Major complications related to the SHAs were noted in 4 of the 13 horses alive long term, consisting of implant failure (n = 1), surgical site infection (n = 2), and scapular fracture (n = 1). The outcome was graded as excellent in 4, good in 5, and moderate in 4 horses. Two ponies were euthanized because scapulohumeral osteoarthritis and subluxation developed in the contralateral limb.\r\nConclusion: Although major complications occurred in about one-third of ponies, SHA with LCP led to long-term survival with good function in most ponies.\r\nClinical significance: SHA with an LCP offers a high chance for good long-term outcome in small equids although contralateral disease may affect outcome.",

Many patients present in childhood but milder forms may present later in life. Some countries have newborn screening programs for the homocystinurias but these do not detect all patients.\r\n\r\nResults: HCU Network Australia is one of the very few support groups for patients with homocystinurias. Here we report the results of its survey of 143 patients and caregivers from 22 countries, evaluating current diagnostic pathways and management for the homocystinurias. Most (110) of the responses related to patients with CBS deficiency. The diagnosis was made by newborn screening in 20% of patients and in 50% of the others within 1\u00a0year of the initial symptom but in 12.5% it took over 15\u00a0years. The delay was attributed mainly to ignorance of the disease. Physicians need to learn to measure homocysteine concentrations in children with neurodevelopmental problems, and in patients with heterogeneous symptoms such as thromboembolism, dislocation of the optic lens, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and psychiatric disease. Even when the diagnosis is made, the way it is communicated is sometimes poor. Early-onset CBS deficiency usually requires a low-protein diet with amino acid supplements. More than a third of the participants reported problems with the availability or cost of treatment. Only half of the patients always took their amino acid mixture. In contrast, good adherence to the protein restriction was reported in 98% but 80% said it was hard, time-consuming and caused unhappiness.\r\n              \r\nConclusions: There is often a long delay in diagnosing the homocystinurias unless this is achieved by newborn screening; this survey also highlights problems with the availability and cost of treatment and the palatability of protein substitutes.",

However, the effect of gender as a prognostic factor for long-term outcomes following TAVI remains unclear. Between 2008 and 2018, all patients (n\u202f=\u202f683) who underwent TAVI in 2 centres in Melbourne, Australia were prospectively included in a registry. The primary end-point was long-term mortality. The secondary end points were Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) in-hospital complications and mortality at 30-days and 1-year. Of 683 patients, 328 (48%) were women. Women had a higher mean STS-PROM score (5.2 \u00b1 3.1 vs 4.6 \u00b1 3.5, p < 0.001) but less co-morbidities than men. Women had a significantly higher in-hospital bleeding rates (3.3% vs 1.0%, Odds Ratio 4.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16 to15.25, p\u202f=\u202f0.027) and higher 30-day mortality (2.4% vs 0.3%, hazard ratio [HR] 8.75, 95% CI 1.09 to 69.6, p\u202f=\u202f0.040) than men. Other VARC-2 outcomes were similar between genders. Overall mortality rate was 36% (246) over a median follow up of 2.7 (interquartile rang [IQR] 1.7 to 4.2) years. Median time to death was 5.3 (95% CI 4.7 to 5.7) years. One-year mortality was similar between genders (8.3% vs 7.8%), as was long-term mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17, p\u202f=\u202f0.38). On multivariable analysis, female gender was an independent predictor for 1-year mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f2.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.92, p\u202f=\u202f0.026), but not long-term mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.14, p\u202f=\u202f0.20). In the women only cohort, STS-PROM was the only independent predictor of long-term mortality (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.48, p < 0.001). In conclusion, women had higher rates of peri-procedural major bleeding and 30-day mortality following TAVI. However, long-term outcomes were similar between genders.",

The overall survival rate after HSCT (median follow-up, 20 months) was 70.8% (17 of 24 patients); all deaths were due to nonspecific, early, transplant-related mortality. Currently, 82.7% of patients who did not receive a transplant (43 of 52; age range, 3-69 years) are alive. Of 17 HSCT survivors, 7 are in complete remission and 5 are in good partial remission without treatment (together, 12 of 17 [70.6%]). In contrast, only 5 of 43 patients who did not receive a transplant (11.6%) are without immunosuppression. Immune deficiency and dysregulation activity scores were significantly lower in patients who survived HSCT than in those receiving conventional treatment (P = .005) or in patients who received abatacept or sirolimus as compared with other therapies, and in patients with residual LRBA expression. Higher disease burden, longer duration before HSCT, and lung involvement were associated with poor outcome.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The lifelong disease activity, implying a need for immunosuppression and risk of malignancy, must be weighed against the risks of HSCT.\r\n\r\nKeywords: CTLA4; Inborn error of immunity; abatacept; clinical score; combined immunodeficiency; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; immune dysregulation; performance scale; primary immunodeficiency disorder; sirolimus.",

We argue that rising inequality not only intensifies relative deprivation, but also signals a potential threat of social decline, as gaps in the social hierarchy widen. Hence, voters higher up in the social hierarchy may turn to the radical right to defend existing social boundaries. Using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data from 14 OECD countries over three decades, we find that rising income inequality increases the likelihood of radical right support \u2013 most pronouncedly among individuals with high subjective social status and lower-middle incomes. Adding to evidence that the threat of decline, rather than actual deprivation, pushes voters towards the radical right, we highlight income inequality as the crucial factor conditioning perceived threats from a widening social hierarchy.",

Although screening methods for PCa have substantially improved, the outcome for patients with advanced PCa remains poor. The elucidation of the molecular mechanism that drives the progression from a slow-growing, organ-confined tumor to a highly invasive and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) is therefore important. We have already proved the diagnostic potential of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) when detected in urine of individuals at risk of developing PCa. The aim of this study was to implement IDO as a prognostic marker for PCa patients undergoing surgical treatment. We have thus conducted an observational study by collecting 100 urine samples from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy as first treatment of choice. To test the integrity of our investigation, scale dilution cells of an established PC3 cell line were added to urine of healthy donors and used for gene expression analysis by a TaqMan assay on the catalytic part of IDO mRNA. Our data show that the quantification of IDO mRNA in urine of patients has a very promising ability to identify patients at high risk of cancer advancement, as defined by Gleason score. Our goal is to lay the groundwork to develop a superior test for PCa. The data generated are thus necessary (i) to strengthen the IDO-based diagnostic/prognostic test and (ii) to provide patients and clinicians with an affordable and easy screening test.",

In each village, children were sampled to participate in weekly sessions in which data signals were collected through wearable devices (electrocardiography [ECG] hand pads and electroencephalography [EEG] headbands). Additionally, wearable proximity sensors to elicit the social network were deployed among children and their caregivers. Mobile surveys using interactive voice response calls were also used as an additional layer of data collection. An end-line face-to-face survey was conducted at the end of the study.\r\nResults:\r\nDuring the implementation, 82 EEG/ECG data entry points were collected across four villages. The sampled children for EEG/ECG were 0 to 5 years old. EEG/ECG data were collected once a week. In every session, children wore the EEG headband for 5 minutes and the ECG hand pad for 3 minutes. In total, 3531 calls were sent over 5 weeks, with 2291 participants picking up the calls and 984 of those answering the consent question. In total, 585 people completed the surveys over the course of 5 weeks.\r\nConclusions:\r\nThis study achieved its objective of demonstrating the feasibility of generating data through the unprecedented use of a multimodal approach for tracking child development in Malawi, which is one of the poorest countries in the world. Above and beyond its multiple dimensions, the dynamics of child development are complex. It is the case not only that no data stream in isolation can accurately characterize it, but also that even if combined, infrequent data might miss critical inflection points and interactions between different conditions and behaviors. In turn, combining different modes at a sufficiently high frequency allows researchers to make progress by considering contact patterns, reported symptoms and behaviors, and critical biomarkers all at once. This application showcases that even in developing countries facing multiple constraints, complementary technologies can leverage and accelerate the digitalization of health, bringing benefits to populations that lack new tools for understanding child well-being and development.",

Because of their different pharmacological profiles, immunotherapies and/or targeted therapies have been studied in various combinations. Areas covered: We reviewed PubMed for most important clinical trials investigating efficacy and tolerability of combinatorial and single-agent approaches for the treatment of melanoma that were published up to June 2019. We discuss the most promising therapy approaches and highlight challenges of melanoma treatment. Expert opinion: Combinatorial approaches seem to be very promising in the treatment of resectable and advanced melanoma. Currently, dual immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) with nivolumab and ipilimumab offers the best first-line treatment option for patients with BRAF-wt and -mutated, advanced melanoma. It is therapy of choice in younger patients with good ECOG performance status and poor prognostic features, whereas ICI monotherapy should be preferred in elderly patients with advanced melanoma. Benefit-risk ratio, patient's QoL and expectations, as well as treatment costs have to be considered in the choice of treatment. However, to elucidate mechanisms of resistance, biomarkers of response and to better define personalized strategies in the treatment of cutaneous melanoma, larger clinical trials comparing combined versus sequential therapies are necessary.",

We tested this in a small-scale subsistence society, the Tsimane, by associating relative household wealth (n=871) and community-level wealth inequality (n=40, Gini = 0.15 \u2013 0.53) with a range of psychological variables, stressors, and health outcomes (depressive symptoms [n=670], social conflicts [n=401], non-social problems [n=398], social support [n=399], cortisol [n=811], BMI [n=9926], blood pressure [n=3195], self-rated health [n=2523], morbidities [n=1542]) controlling for community-average wealth, age, sex, household size, community size, and distance to markets. Wealthier people largely had better outcomes while inequality associated with more respiratory disease, a leading cause of mortality. Greater inequality and lower wealth were associated with higher blood pressure. Psychosocial factors didn't mediate wealth-health associations. Thus, relative socio-economic position and inequality may affect health across diverse societies, though this is likely exacerbated in high-income countries.",

We argue that redistributive preferences reflect an interaction between material self-interest and political ideology. The self-interest argument predicts growing opposition to redistribution as income increases, while the argument of ideologically driven preferences suggests that left-leaning citizens are more supportive of redistribution than right-leaning citizens. Focusing on cross-pressured voters, we expect that the difference in redistribution preferences between left- and right-leaning citizens is smaller at the bottom of the income hierarchy than at the top. Among the group of left-leaning citizens, the role of material self-interest is expected to be smaller than among right-leaning citizens. We provide evidence in line with our argument analysing data from the European Social Survey in 25 European democracies between 2008 and 2018.",

A Case Study of Development Use of Drones\nAbstract: With the rise of the \u201chumanitarian drone\u201d in recent years, drones have become one of the most controversial public interest technologies that have gained increasing media attention. It is worth noting that, although there is a perception in the aid sector that drones hold the promise to reinvent the health supply logistics, to date, routine drone delivery is still relatively new and largely unproven. This paper presents a recent field study conducted in 2019, where drones were deployed in Malawi to help address the last mile challenge in medical supply delivery, and where a noticeable mentality of \u201ckilling two birds with one stone\u201d around the attempt of using drones in resource-poor settings is observed. The objective of the paper is to shed light, through a real-world case study and from the ethical perspective, on the impacts of implementing such a systemic change in the existing health supply chain systems. As conclusion, a call for more reflexive approaches for the critical examination, as well as more structured guidance for the responsible evaluation, of medical cargo drones is raised.",

The ability to get a loan may allow individuals to purchase a home, invest in education and training, or start and then expand a business. Hence access to credit has important implications for upward mobility and potentially also for inequality. Adverse selection and moral hazard problems due to asymmetric information between lenders and borrowers affect credit availability. Because of these information issues, lenders may limit credit or post higher lending rates and often require borrowers to pledge collateral. Consequently, relatively poor individuals with limited capital endowment may experience credit denial, irrespective of the quality of their investment ideas. As a result, their exclusion from credit access can hinder economic mobility and entrench income inequality. In this post, we describe the results of our recent paper which contributes to the understanding of this mechanism.",

We hypothesized that cognitive depressive symptoms are positively associated with the coagulation activation marker D-dimer throughout the first year after myocardial infarction (MI).\r\n\r\nMethods: Patients with acute MI (mean age 60 years, 85% men) were investigated at hospital admission (n = 190), 3 months (n = 154) and 12 months (n = 106). Random linear mixed regression models were used to evaluate the relation between cognitive depressive symptoms, assessed with the Beck depression inventory (BDI), and changes in plasma D-dimer levels. Demographics, cardiac disease severity, medical comorbidity, depression history, medication, health behaviors, and stress hormones were considered for analyses.\r\n\r\nResults: The prevalence of clinical depressive symptoms (13-item BDI score \u2265 6) was 13.2% at admission and stable across time. Both continuous (p < .05) and categorical (p < .010) cognitive depressive symptoms were related to higher D-dimer levels over time, independent of covariates. Indicating clinical relevance, D-dimer was 73 ng/ml higher in patients with a BDI score \u2265 6 versus those with a score < 6. There was a cognitive depressive symptom-by-cortisol interaction (p < .05) with a positive association between cognitive depressive symptoms and D-dimer when cortisol levels were high (p < .010), but not when cortisol levels were low (p > .05). Fluctuations (up and down) of cognitive depressive symptoms and D-dimer from one investigation to the next showed also significant associations (p < .05).\r\n\r\nConclusions: Cognitive depressive symptoms were independently associated with hypercoagulability in patients up to 1 year after MI. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis could potentially modify this effect.\r\n\r\nKeywords: coagulation; coronary heart disease; cortisol; psychological stress",

Increasingly, these effects are the object of interest of the estimation, and predicted effects are often used for further descriptive and regression analyses. To avoid imposing distributional assumptions on these effects, they are typically estimated via fixed effects methods. In short panels, the conventional maximum likelihood estimator for fixed effects binary response models provides poor estimates of these individual effects since the finite sample bias is typically substantial. We present a bias-reduced fixed effects estimator that provides better estimates of the individual effects in these models by removing the first-order asymptotic bias. An additional, practical advantage of the estimator is that it provides finite predictions for all individual effects in the sample, including those for which the corresponding dependent variable has identical outcomes in all time periods over time (either all zeros or ones); for these, the maximum likelihood prediction is infinite. We illustrate the approach in simulation experiments and in an application to health care utilization.",

We evaluated OF as a potential specimen for detection by culture of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Yersinia enterocolitica, and the detection of antibodies against Salmonella spp. and hepatitis E virus (HEV) using commercial ELISAs. Samples from 33 pig farms were collected at the beginning and end of the fattening period. Results of the OF samples were compared with the results of serum samples and nasal swabs from individual pigs and pen floor fecal samples, using the Cohen kappa (\u03ba) and the McNemar test. For Salmonella spp. antibodies, OF samples were negative, although the corresponding serum samples were positive. The detection of HEV antibodies in sera and OF had agreement at the first sampling, and poor and significant agreement at the second sampling (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.185, McNemar p\u2009=\u20090.238; \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.088, McNemar p\u2009<\u20090.001).

Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to SDG 8, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. Since more than 90 percent of jobs are created by the private sector, more attention must be paid to entrepreneurs that help create dynamic and responsible enterprises that often generate positive externalities for society and the environment through investments in scalable innovations and a commitment to local embeddedness. As such, they help lift people out of poverty through new and relatively well-paid jobs and enable local economies to become more sustainable through global value chain integration.",

Patients were divided into \"antiplatelet-user\" and \"non-user\" according to the use of acetylsalicylic acid prior to the hemorrhage. Primary outcome was poor clinical outcome at six months (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1-3). Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and impact of thrombocyte transfusion.\r\nRESULTS: Of the 1033 patients, 161 (15.6%) were antiplatelet users. The antiplatelet users were older with higher incidence of cardiovascular risk factors. Antiplatelet use was associated with poor outcome and in-hospital mortality.

Despite their strong associations with critical personal outcomes, surprisingly little research has investigated the development of malevolent traits. Addressing this gap, we examined age trends in Machiavellianism across the lifespan.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Using data from a large-scale cross-sectional sample (n\u00a0=\u00a01,118,643), we analyzed mean-level changes from age 10 to 67.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Age differences in Machiavellianism were most pronounced as a strong upward trend during the transition from late childhood to adolescence, when it peaked. Throughout adulthood it exhibited a steady downward trend, reaching an overall minimum at age 65. Across the lifespan, Machiavellianism tended to be higher in men and high-income participants. Compared to Machiavellianism, the age trends in Agreeableness and-to a lesser extent-Conscientiousness showed almost perfectly polar opposite patterns.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Age trends in malevolent personality conform to established patterns of normative change, indicating temporary disruption in adolescence and social maturation across adulthood. The results advance theory and research on personality trait development across the lifespan and highlight crucial developmental windows that can inform targeted interventions to keep socially aversive traits in check.",

At present, monitoring is limited and unevenly distributed across mountain regions globally. Existing thematic networks do not fully support the generation of multidisciplinary knowledge required to inform decisions, enact drivers of sustainable development, and safeguard against losses. In this paper, the Mountain Observatories Working Group, established by the Mountain Research Initiative (MRI) Science Leadership Council, identifies geographical and thematic gaps as well as recent advances in monitoring of relevant biophysical and socioeconomic variables in the mountains. We propose principles and ways of connecting existing initiatives, supporting emerging areas, and developing new mountain observatory networks regionally and, eventually, globally. Particularly in the data-poor regions, we aspire to build a community of researchers and practitioners in collaboration with the Global Network on Observations and Information in Mountain Environments, Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Mountains, a GEO Work Programme Initiative.",

Here, we aim to evaluate the association of radiotherapy on survival in glioblastoma patients presenting with poor postoperative performance status in first-line setting.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 93 glioblastoma patients presenting with poor postoperative performance status (ECOG 2-4) at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, in the years 2005-2019. A total of 43 patients received radiotherapy with or without systemic therapy in the first-line setting, whereas 50 patients received no additive local or systemic treatment after initial biopsy or resection. Overall survival was calculated from primary diagnosis and from the end of radiotherapy. In addition, factors influencing survival were analyzed.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Median overall survival from primary diagnosis was 6.2\u00a0months in the radiotherapy group (95% CI 6.2-14.8\u00a0weeks, range 2-149\u00a0weeks) and 2.3\u00a0months in the group without additive treatment (95% CI 1.3-7.4\u00a0weeks, range 0-28\u00a0weeks) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This survival benefit was confirmed by landmark analyses. Factors associated with overall survival were extent of resection and administration of radiotherapy with or without systemic treatment. Median survival from end of radiotherapy was 3\u00a0months (95% CI 4.3-21.7\u00a0weeks, range 0-72\u00a0weeks), with 25.6% (n\u2009=\u200911) early termination of treatment and 83.7% (n\u2009=\u200936) requiring radiotherapy as in-patients.

It is not clear whether borderline personality related characteristics in children share etiological features with adult borderline personality disorder. We investigated the etiology of borderline personality related characteristics in a longitudinal cohort study of 1,116 pairs of same-sex twins followed from birth through age 12 years. Borderline personality related characteristics measured at age 12 years were highly heritable, were more common in children who had exhibited poor cognitive function, impulsivity, and more behavioral and emotional problems at age 5 years, and co-occurred with symptoms of conduct disorder, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Exposure to harsh treatment in the family environment through age 10 years predicted borderline personality related characteristics at age 12 years. This association showed evidence of environmental mediation and was stronger among children with a family history of psychiatric illness, consistent with diathesis-stress models of borderline etiology. Results indicate that borderline personality related characteristics in children share etiological features with borderline personality disorder in adults and suggest that inherited and environmental risk factors make independent and interactive contributions to borderline etiology.",

However, access is difficult in remote rural areas (Handayani & Babajanian, 2012). This case study examines obstacles that beneficiaries from five Nepalese mountain villages encounter when accessing a social pension. A critical livelihoods perspective provides a suitable lens to grasp their experiences from an emic perspective. Based on qualitative in-depth interviews, participant observation, group discussions and expert interviews, the findings illustratively reveal that barriers involve poor health, illiteracy, lack of awareness, lack of familial support, poor infrastructure, recent changes in disbursement, and geographic remoteness. This article concludes that non-contributory social pensions have proven effective for supporting older people to maintain a livelihood. Hence, \r\nimplementation and disbursement methods should be reconsidered because the access to the social pension turned out to remain difficult. Based on the findings, possible recommendations for improvement and implementation of social pensions for older people are made.",

These investments require a baseline metric that describes the burden of animal health and welfare in order to justify and prioritise resource allocation and from which to measure the impact of interventions. This paper is part of a process of scientific enquiry in which problems are identified and solutions sought in an inclusive way. It poses the broad question: what should a system to measure the animal disease burden on society look like and what value would it add? Moreover, it aims to do this in such a way as to be accessible by a wide audience, who are encouraged to engage in this debate. Given that farmed animals, including those raised by poor smallholders, are an economic entity, this system should be based on economic principles. These poor farmers are negatively impacted by disparities in animal health technology, which can be addressed through a mixture of supply-led and demand-driven interventions, reinforcing the relevance of targeted financial support from government and non-governmental organisations. The Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) Programme will glean existing data to measure animal health losses within carefully characterised production systems. Consistent and transparent attribution of animal health losses will enable meaningful comparisons of the animal disease burden to be made between diseases, production systems and countries, and will show how it is apportioned by people's socio-economic status and gender. The GBADs Programme will produce a cloud-based knowledge engine and data portal, through which users will access burden metrics and associated visualisations, support for decisionmaking in the form of future animal health scenarios, and the outputs of wider economic modelling. The vision of GBADs, strengthening the food system for the benefit of society and the environment, is an example of One Health thinking in action.",

        "document": "Title: National religiosity eases the psychological burden of poverty\nAbstract: Lower socioeconomic status (SES) harms psychological well-being, an effect responsible for widespread human suffering. This effect has long been assumed to weaken as nations develop economically. Recent evidence, however, has contradicted this fundamental assumption, finding instead that the psychological burden of lower SES is even greater in developed nations than in developing ones. That evidence has elicited consternation because it suggests that economic development is no cure for the psychological burden of lower SES. So, why is that burden greatest in developed nations? Here, we test whether national religiosity can explain this puzzle. National religiosity is particularly low in developed nations. Consequently, developed nations lack religious norms that may ease the burden of lower SES. Drawing on three different data sets of 1,567,204, 1,493,207, and 274,393 people across 156, 85, and 92 nations, we show that low levels of national religiosity can account for the greater burden of lower SES in developed nations. This finding suggests that, as national religiosity continues to decline, lower SES will become increasingly harmful for well-being\u2014a societal change that is socially consequential and demands political attention.",

On neonatal MRI, SB-associated brain malformations were assessed. Ventricular size, ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VPS), and endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) were also documented. Neurodevelopment was assessed with the Bayley-III and correlated with brain malformations, ventricular size, and VPS/ETV placement.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nChiari II malformation was detected in all patients. Corpus callosum (CC) abnormality was noted in 40%, heterotopies in 35%, and cerebellar parenchymal defects in 11%. 96% had ventriculomegaly; in 46%, VPS/ETV was performed. Cognitive and language testing yielded results in the low-average range (Bayley-III: Cognitive Composite Score 93.6, Language Composite Score 89.7), motor testing was below average (Motor Composite Score 77.4). CC abnormalities, heterotopies, and cerebellar defects were not associated with poorer Bayley-III scores, whereas patients with severe ventriculomegaly performed poorer in all subtests, significantly so for the language composite score. Patients requiring intervention for hydrocephalus had significantly lower scores in motor testing.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION/CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAdditional brain malformations in open SB do not seem to have an impact on cognitive function at 2 years of age. Severe ventriculomegaly is a risk factor for poorer cognitive outcome; hydrocephalus surgery adds an additional risk for delayed motor function.",

Therefore, in addition to multi-chemotherapeutic regimens IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) targeting approaches have been evaluated including immunoliposomal (IL) preparations utilizing an IGF-1R inhibiting antibody. In the current study, we extended our experiments by long-term treatment regimens in the classical adrenocortical NCIH295R xenograft model as well as by short-term experiments in two novel xenograft models, which all displayed different levels of IGF-1R and IGF-2 expression. Interestingly, these experiments reveal sub-group dependent differences in therapeutic outcome, reflecting clinical observations and indicate, thus, that implementation of this panel of tumor models might be helpful for clinical translation of novel therapeutic regimens in the future.",

Major and minor events related to airway management were prospectively recorded for 9 weeks. After implementation of changes to departmental strategies for airway management, events were again prospectively recorded over 9 weeks. Primary outcome was number of cases with events. Secondary outcomes were various predefined events.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nAt study baseline, 3668 cases and at follow-up 3786 cases were assessed.

All transplants had a complete virtual crossmatch and DSA were detected in 19% (411/2215). The investigated composite endpoint was a poor first-year outcome defined as (i) allograft failure or (ii) death or (iii) poor allograft function (eGFR \u226425\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m$^{2}$ ) at one year. Two hundred and twenty-one (221/2215; 10%) transplants showed a poor first-year outcome. Rejection (24/70; 34%) was the most common reason for graft failure. First-year patient's death was rare (48/2215; 2%). There were no statistically significant differences between DSA-positive and DSA-negative transplants regarding composite and each individual endpoint, as well as reasons for graft failure and death. DSA-positive transplants experienced more frequently rejection episodes, mainly antibody-mediated rejection (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The combination of DSA and any first year rejection was associated with the overall poorest death-censored allograft survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). In conclusion, presence of pre-transplant DSA per se does not affect first year outcomes. However, DSA-positive transplants experiencing first year rejection are a high-risk population for poor allograft survival and may benefit from intense clinical surveillance.",

Despite an overall decline in sleep duration and a delay in bedtime, significant interindividual variation in sleep has been reported. The aim of the current study was to examine genetic and environmental influences on sleep in adolescence using long-term (6 month) actigraphy measurements, differentiating between school and free days. Sixteen monozygotic (n = 32) and 10 dizygotic (n = 20) twin pairs (mean age 12.8 \u00b1 1.0 years; 25 females) participated in the study. Structural equation modeling was used to compute genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental contributors to sleep behavior. We found significantly more genetic influence on sleep timing (sleep midpoint; school: 14%, free: 90%) and duration (school: 15%; free: 68%) on free compared with school days. On the other hand, the genetic influence on measures of sleep quality (sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency) was high (>60%) and less dependent on the day of measurement. Only wake after sleep onset (WASO) exhibited a strong shared environmental influence (> 52%) on both school and free days, suggesting that behavioral/environmental interventions may help reduce WASO. In addition, self-reported chronotype was also highly genetically influenced (75%). Disrupted, ill-timed, and insufficient sleep in adolescence is associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes. Our findings of a strong genetic contribution to sleep in adolescence suggest that sleep may mark a genetic vulnerability to poor outcomes.",

        "document": "Title: Horn Growth and Reproduction in a Long-Lived Male Mammal: No Compensation for Poor Early-Life Horn Growth\nAbstract: Secondary sexual traits in males of polygynous species are important determinants of reproductive success. It is, however, unknown if and how the development of continuously growing traits at different life-stages is related to reproduction in long-lived male mammals. In this study, we evaluated the relationship of early and late horn growth on social status and reproduction in long-lived male Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). For this, we analysed individual horn growth and assessed its effect on dominance and reproduction. No evidence was detected for compensatory horn growth, as late-life horn growth positively depended on early-life horn growth in males. Still, individuals with longer horn segments grown during early adulthood experienced a stronger age-dependent length decline in annual horn growth during the late development. Accordingly, a divergence between individual growth potential and realized horn growth late in life has to be assumed. Residual age-specific horn length and length of early grown horn segments both positively affected dominance and reproductive success, whereas, contrary to our expectation, no significant effect of the length of horn segments grown during the late development was detected. Suspected higher somatic costs incurred by high-quality males during their late development might at least partly be responsible for this finding. Overall, our study suggests that the total length of horns and their early development in long-lived male Alpine ibex is a reliable indicator of reproductive success and that individuals may be unable to compensate for poor early-life growth performance at a later point in life.",

Coalition positions are a result of compromise between their members, and thus the increase in bargaining power may come at a price if the preferences of their members are heterogeneous.

However, the clinical significance of IL22 in human colorectal cancer remains unclear. We sought to determine whether the IL22 pathway is associated with prognosis in human colorectal cancer, and to identify mechanisms by which IL22 can influence disease progression.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\r\n\r\nTranscriptomic data from stage II/III colon cancers in independent discovery (GSE39582 population-based cohort, N = 566) and verification (PETACC3 clinical trial, N = 752) datasets were used to investigate the association between IL22 receptor expression (encoded by the genes IL22RA1 and IL10RB), tumor mutation status, and clinical outcome using Cox proportional hazard models. Functional interactions between IL22 and mutant KRAS were elucidated using human colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumor organoids.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nTranscriptomic analysis revealed a poor-prognosis subset of tumors characterized by high expression of IL22RA1, the alpha subunit of the heterodimeric IL22 receptor, and KRAS mutation [relapse-free survival (RFS): HR = 2.93, P = 0.0006; overall survival (OS): HR = 2.45, P = 0.0023]. KRAS mutations showed a similar interaction with IL10RB and conferred the worst prognosis in tumors with high expression of both IL22RA1 and IL10RB (RFS: HR = 3.81, P = 0.0036; OS: HR = 3.90, P = 0.0050). Analysis of human colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumor organoids, including an isogenic cell line pair that differed only in KRAS mutation status, showed that IL22 and mutant KRAS cooperatively enhance cancer cell proliferation, in part through augmentation of the Myc pathway.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nInteractions between KRAS and IL22 signaling may underlie a previously unrecognized subset of clinically aggressive colorectal cancer that could benefit from therapeutic modulation of the IL22 pathway.",

Attitudes towards local governance reforms in Switzerland and Germany\nAbstract: Substantive representation, i.e. congruence between citizens\u2019 and representatives\u2019 issue positions, has become an important topic in scholarly debates and is seen as a normatively desirable feature of representative democracy. Existing empirical research on substantive representation has mostly focused on the quality of national issue representation and scholars investigated the ideological and issue congruence between party electorates and representatives in national parliaments.\r\nFor other government levels, however, we have little knowledge about issue congruence between citizens and elites. For example, do citizens differ from their representatives in their assessment of local issues? We contribute to an answer of this question by analyzing on a highly relevant and contentious issue in the local context: metropolitan governance reforms. To do so, we rely on two different survey data sources. For measuring citizen attitudes towards different local governance reforms, we rely on a survey that was conducted for selected metropolitan areas, amongst others in Germany and Switzerland. For the measurement of elite attitudes, we use data from a survey among European mayors in cities with more than 10\u2019000 inhabitants.\r\nIn general, the results suggest that congruence in attitudes on local governance reforms between citizens and mayors is rather scarce. Living in a particular local context, e.g. a poor suburb, does not seem to affect citizens and elites positions in the same way. More importantly, not even citizens and mayors living in the same municipality are generally more congruent in their views than mayors and citizens living in different municipalities. Nonetheless, we find evidence for a cue-effect from local political elites to local citizens with regard to one particular reform: amalgamation. These findings raise important questions with regard to local democratic representation.",

Here, we propose a novel therapeutic approach through modulating intracellular free cholesterol via the liver X receptor alpha (LXR\u03b1) in combination with current first-line pharmacotherapy, mitotane. H295R and MUC-1 ACC cell lines were pretreated with LXR\u03b1 inhibitors in combination with mitotane. In H295R, mitotane (20, 40 and 50 \u00b5M) induced dose-dependent cell death; however, in MUC-1, this only occurred at a supratherapeutic concentration (200 \u00b5M). LXR\u03b1 inhibition potentiated mitotane-induced cytotoxicity in both cell lines. This was confirmed through use of the CompuSyn model which showed moderate pharmacological synergism and was indicative of apoptotic cell death via an increase in annexinV and cleaved-caspase 3 expression. Inhibition of LXR\u03b1 was confirmed through downregulation of cholesterol efflux pumps ABCA1 and ABCG1; however, combination treatment with mitotane attenuated this effect. Intracellular free-cholesterol levels were associated with increased cytotoxicity in H295R (r2 = 0.5210) and MUC-1 (r2 = 0.9299) cells. While both cell lines exhibited similar levels of free cholesterol at baseline, H295R were cholesterol ester rich, whereas MUC-1 were cholesterol ester poor. We highlight the importance of LXR\u03b1 mediated cholesterol metabolism in the management of ACC, drawing attention to its role in the therapeutics of mitotane sensitive tumours. We also demonstrate significant differences in cholesterol storage between mitotane sensitive and resistant disease.",

Currently, specific guidelines have been developed for common malignant endocrine tumours, which also incorporate advances in molecular targeted therapies (MTT), as in thyroid cancer and in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine malignancies. However, there is little information regarding the role and efficacy of MTT in the relatively rare malignant endocrine tumours mainly involving the adrenal medulla, adrenal cortex, pituitary, and parathyroid glands. Due to the rarity of these tumours and the lack of prospective studies, current guidelines are mostly based on retrospective data derived from surgical, locoregional and ablative therapies, and studies with systemic chemotherapy. In addition, in many of these malignancies the prognosis remains poor with individual patients responding differently to currently available treatments, necessitating the development of new personalised therapeutic strategies. Recently, major advances in the molecular understanding of endocrine tumours based on genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptome analysis have emerged, resulting in new insights into their pathogenesis and molecular pathology. This in turn has led to the use of novel MTTs in increasing numbers of patients. In this review, we aim to present currently existing and evolving data using MTT in the treatment of adrenal, pituitary and malignant parathyroid tumours, and explore the current utility and effectiveness of such therapies and their future evolution.",

Some cardiac defects may be associated with a poor COVID-19 outcome. Risk estimation in ACHD is currently based on expert opinion. The aim of this study was to collect clinical outcome data and to identify risk factors for a complicated course of COVID-19 in patients with ACHD.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nTwenty-five ACHD centres in nine European countries participated in the study. Consecutive patients with ACHD diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting to one of the participating centres between 27 March and 6 June 2020 were included. A complicated disease course was defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation and/or inotropic support, or a fatal outcome.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOf 105 patients with a mean age of 38\u00b113 years (58% women), 13 had a complicated disease course, of whom 5 died.

Although this is linked to several high-level factors such as poor infrastructure, socio-demographic and political factors, healthcare funding has often been cited as the major reason for the wide gap in availability, accessibility and quality of care between LLMICs and rich countries. With the steady rising incidence and prevalence of kidney diseases globally, as well as cost of care, LLMICs are likely to suffer more consequences of these increases than rich countries and may be unable to meet targets of universal health coverage (UHC) for kidney diseases. As health systems in LLMICs continue to adapt in finding ways to provide access to affordable kidney care, various empirical and evidence-based strategies can be applied to assist them. This review uses a framework for healthcare strengthening developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess various challenges that health systems in LLMICs confront in providing optimal kidney care to their population. We also suggest ways to overcome these barriers and strengthen health systems to improve kidney care in LLMICs.",

The use and availability of SBRT has increased rapidly over the past decades. SBRT has been proven to be a safe, effective and efficient treatment for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is presently considered the standard of care in the treatment of medically or functionally inoperable patients. Evidence from prospective randomized trials on the optimal treatment of patients deemed medically operable remains owing, as three trials comparing SBRT to surgery in this cohort were terminated prematurely due to poor accrual. Yet, SBRT in early stage NSCLC is associated with favorable toxicity profiles and excellent rates of local control, prompting discussion in regard of the treatment of medically operable patients, where the standard of care currently remains surgical resection. Although local control in early stage NSCLC after SBRT is high, distant failure remains an issue, prompting research interest to the combination of SBRT and systemic treatment. Evolving advances in SBRT technology further facilitate the safe treatment of patients with medically or anatomically challenging situations. In this review article, we discuss international guidelines and the current standard of care, ongoing clinical challenges and future directions from the clinical and technical point of view.",

A high pill burden can adversely affect patients&rsquo; implementation of their treatment regimens and may lead to omitting doses of medication. The aim of this study was to investigate medication implementation adherence in liver and kidney transplant recipients converted from twice-daily, immediate-release tacrolimus to once-daily, prolonged-release tacrolimus.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nThis multicentre, non-interventional, observational, 12-month study evaluated implementation adherence in routine practice at five hospitals in Switzerland. Patients attended four clinical visits: at baseline (pre-conversion), and then at week 2, month 6 and month 12 post-conversion. Implementation was defined as consistently taking medication at the correct time and at the correct dose in order to achieve target tacrolimus trough levels. Implementation adherence was evaluated in three ways: using the Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medications Scale (BAASIS) interview questionnaire (at baseline and month 12), investigator-rated patient adherence (recorded at all visits), and tacrolimus trough levels (assessed throughout the study; sub-therapeutic levels were predefined by the investigator on an individual patient basis, over-therapeutic levels were defined as tacrolimus trough levels &gt;15 ng/ml). The primary composite endpoint was non-adherence according to the BAASIS at month 12, any post-conversion investigator adherence rating of &ldquo;poor&rdquo;, or sub-therapeutic or over-therapeutic tacrolimus trough levels at month 6 or 12. Secondary endpoints included: individual components of the composite non-adherence primary endpoint, tacrolimus pill burden, patient satisfaction, and adverse drug reactions.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nSeventy-five patients received prolonged-release tacrolimus; 68 patients (46 kidney and 22 liver transplant recipients) completed the study. Of these 68 patients, 24 had missing data for at least one component of the primary endpoint; therefore, data for the primary composite endpoint were evaluable for 44 patients. Most (81.8%; 36/44) patients were non-adherent for the composite endpoint. Sub-therapeutic tacrolimus trough levels outside of the predefined therapeutic range were the largest contributor to the composite endpoint, and were detected in 62.0% (31/50) of patients. Overall non-adherence according to the BAASIS was similar pre-conversion (30.7%) and at 12 months post-conversion (28.3%). Investigators rated adherence as &ldquo;poor&rdquo; for two patients. Prolonged-release tacrolimus decreased tacrolimus pill burden in 66.7% of patients. All patients were very satisfied / satisfied with prolonged-release tacrolimus; 75.0% found it easier to remember to take prolonged-release versus immediate-release tacrolimus. Twenty percent of patients reported adverse drug reactions, with infections being the most frequently reported (9.3%).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOverall, 1-year non-adherence rates were similar following conversion from immediate-release to prolonged-release tacrolimus; however, prolonged-release tacrolimus intake was more convenient. No new safety signals were detected.",

This study aims to 1) examine the prevalence of cannabis use during adolescence, and 2) investigate links of frequent (i.e., weekly or daily) teenage cannabis use with psychopathology and functional well-being at age 20\u2014compared to no or occasional use.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nData came from a prospective-longitudinal cohort study (assessments from 2004 to 2018, from ages 7\u201320) in an urban setting (N = 1482). Substance use was assessed with self-reports between ages 13 and 20. At age 20, participants reported on psychopathology (psychotic symptoms, problematic substance use, aggression, and internalizing symptoms) and functional well-being (delinquency, financial difficulties, social exclusion, general well-being, and not being in education, employment, or training). Covariates were based on self-, parent-, teacher-, and behavioral measures.\r\nFindings\r\n\r\nAlmost one in five adolescents had used cannabis frequently between ages 13 and 17 (26.6% of males, 9.8% of females). Adjusting nearly 20 potential confounders, frequent teenage cannabis use was associated with age 20 problematic substance use and poorer functional well-being compared to the no cannabis use and the occasional use groups. Frequent teenage cannabis use was more consistently associated with age 20 functional outcomes compared to frequent teenage nicotine or alcohol use.\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nFrequent teenage cannabis use was common and associated with problematic substance use, more delinquency, and poorer functional well-being at age 20.

This represents particular risk to patients with autoimmune diseases, a group already at increased risk of hospitalization and poor clinical outcomes related to COVID-19 infection. Whilst there is a paucity of long-term safety and efficacy data of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with autoimmune diseases, the current evidence strongly suggests that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of adverse effects and disease flares.

Degree of anisometropia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008; univariable analysis), increasing anisometropia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009; multivariable), eccentric fixation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; univariable and multivariable); large IOD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; univariable and multivariable) and non-compliance during therapy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028; univariable) were associated with IOD increase.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nLong-term results of occlusion therapy were good. High or increasing anisometropia, eccentric fixation and non-compliance during occlusion therapy were associated with long-term VA decrease. Subjects with poor initial VA had a larger increase despite little patching, but often showed long-term VA decrease.",

Our study aims to fill this gap by determining the frequency of the risk categories for OSA and how they might correlate with the specific CU patient reported outcome measures urticaria activity score (UAS7), urticaria control test (UCT) and CU quality of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL).\r\nMethods\r\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study involving a cohort of 171 Latin American CU patients. Descriptive statistics were used to determine frequency and proportions for demographic and clinical variables, while a chi-squared test for association between STOP-Bang OSA questionnaire categories and both UAS7 and UCT categories was performed to analyze how such variables interact. To further assess the strength of the correlation a Cramer's V coefficient was reported. Finally, a Kendall-Tau b correlation coefficient was performed to measure the correlation between the STOP-Bang score and other independent continuous variables.\r\nResults\r\nThe average STOP-Bang score was 2.5, with 24% and 21% of patients falling into the intermediate and high-risk category for moderate-to-severe OSA, respectively. There was a strong statistically significant association (Cramer's V = 0.263; p = .000) between UAS-7 categories and STOP-Bang risk categories. A similar pattern of strong significant association (Cramer's V = .269; p = .002) was observed between UCT categories and STOP-Bang risk categories. A weak positive correlation between the STOP-Bang score and the CU-Q2oL average score (\u03c4b = 0.188, p = .001) was identified. Overall, 72.5% patients reported limitations with respect to sleep in a varied degree according to the CU-Q2oL.\r\nConclusions\r\nOur results suggest that a considerable proportion of patients with CU are at intermediate to high risk for OSA. Higher disease activity, poor CU control, and worse quality of life were all found to be associated with an increased risk. Additional studies are needed to determine the exact link between these conditions, and to determine whether screening and treatment for OSA might benefit patients with CU.",

The aim of this study was to assess neurocognitive functioning in a population of young adults with different types of CHD.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nCross-sectional cohort study in young adults with CHD and a group-matched healthy control group. We assessed neurocognitive and general intellectual functioning with a comprehensive battery of standardised neuropsychological tests. In addition to task-based assessments, questionnaire data of executive dysfunctions in everyday life were measured with the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nA total of 67 patients (55% men) with CHD and 55 healthy controls (51% men) were included for analysis. Mean age at assessment was 26.9 (3.68) and 26.0 (3.32) years, respectively. The CHD group performed poorer in the domains of Executive Functions, Memory, Attention & Speed, and general intellectual functioning. Patients with a CHD of severe complexity were more affected than patients with simple or moderate complexity. Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version scores indicated that patients' self-rated deficits in behaviour regulation in everyday life was higher compared with healthy controls.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOur findings indicate lower neurocognitive functioning in young adults with a CHD, particularly in those with severe defect complexity. In view of the potentially enhanced risk for cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disease in this patient group as reported in the literature, systematic longitudinal monitoring of cognitive functioning is recommended.",

There is little information on long-term motor function and its association with behaviour.\r\n\r\nAIMS: To assess motor function and behaviour in a cohort of 10-year-old children with CHD after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Motor performance and movement quality were examined in 129 children with CHD using the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment providing four timed and one qualitative component, and a total timed motor score was created based on the four timed components. The Beery Test of Visual-Motor Integration and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were administered.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: All Zurich Neuromotor Assessment motor tasks were below normative values (all p \u2264 0.001), and the prevalence of poor motor performance (\u226410th percentile) ranged from 22.2% to 61.3% in the different components. Visuomotor integration and motor coordination were poorer compared to norms (all p \u2264 0.001). 14% of all analysed children had motor therapy at the age of 10 years. Children with a total motor score \u226410th percentile showed more internalising (p = 0.002) and externalising (p = 0.028) behavioural problems.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: School-aged children with CHD show impairments in a variety of motor domains which are related to behavioural problems.

Currently, the first-line treatment options for UM are radiation therapy, resection, and enucleation. However, although these treatments could potentially be curative, half of all patients will develop metastatic disease, whose prognosis is still poor. Indeed, effective therapeutic options for patients with advanced or metastatic disease are still lacking. Recently, the development of new treatment modalities with a lower incidence of adverse events, a better disease control rate, and new therapeutic approaches, have merged as new potential and promising therapeutic strategies. Additionally, several clinical trials are ongoing to find new therapeutic options, mainly for those with metastatic disease. Many interventions are still in the preliminary phases of clinical development, being investigated in phase I trial or phase I/II. The success of these trials could be crucial for changing the prognosis of patients with advanced/metastatic UM. In this systematic review, we analyzed all emerging and available literature on the new perspectives in the treatment of UM and patient outcomes; furthermore, their current limitations and more common adverse events are summarized.",

Data included demographics, indication for the intravitreal injection, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and central macular thickness on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) before and after the lockdown.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nOne-hundred and sixty-six eyes of 125 patients were studied, 68 (54.4%) patients were males, and the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation, SD) age was 64.79 (\u00b19.41) years. Mean (\u00b1SD) duration of delay in the planned injection was 60.97 (\u00b124.35) days. The change in visual acuity was statistically significant for patients with diabetic macular edema (p= 0.045 improvement), patients with central retinal vein thrombosis (CRVO) (p= 0.05 deterioration), and patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (p= 0.005 deterioration). Of interest, delay of more than 2 months and the previous need for 3 or more injections were significant poor prognostic factors for visual outcome for patients with diabetic macular edema (p=0.027 and 0.045).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe impact of delay in the scheduled intravitreal injections resulted in variable outcomes depending on the indication. Triaging the urgency of patients should be based on the indication to support the equity principle of bioethics, where those in need are prioritized against others, depending on potential adverse outcome.",

        "document": "Title: The Khoekhoegowab Personality Inventory: The Comparative Validity of a Locally Derived Measure of Traits\nAbstract: Objective: This study explores a personality inventory derived from the results of an indigenous lexical study of personality. From the 272 most commonly used personality descriptors in Khoekhoegowab, the most-spoken of extant Khoesan click languages of southern Africa, an 11-factor model of personality-trait structure was identified. Here, the Khoekhoegowab Personality Inventory (KPI) was created based on those results. Its psychometric properties, the convergent and divergent validity of its scales, and its incremental validity over Big Five and Six traits for predicting physical and mental health, religious practice and attitudes, and income are reported.Methods: Two to five key terms were selected for each of 10 KPI scales: Temperance, Prosocial Diligence, Gossip, Honesty/Morality, Temper, Implacability, Humility, Vanity, Resiliency vs. Agitation, and Courage vs. Fear. These 38 total items were administered to a large sample of adult speakers of Khoekhoegowab in Namibia (N = 632), together with five imported inventories translated into Khoekhoegowab: the 30-item Questionnaire Big Six (QB6), General Self-Reported Health, the Cascades Mental Health Assessment, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Duke Religion Index. The properties and intercorrelations of KPI subscales are explored, and their predictive ability for the other variables is compared to that of the QB6.Results: Due to the small number of items on each scale, poor internal consistency was anticipated, but the KPI scales' properties were somewhat better than those of the QB6. R-square change by the inventories as a whole, after accounting for age and gender, indicted that the KPI scales explained more variance than the QB6 scales in almost all criterion variables. Replication of established associations for Big Six traits was mixed: associations were largely as expected for Resiliency, Conscientiousness, and Honesty, but less so for Agreeableness and Extraversion.Conclusions: The KPI had some advantages over the QB6 in predicting physical and mental health. In particular, the four items of Resiliency vs. Agitation predicted lower scores on all physical and mental problem scales. Given psychological-care needs in Namibia, this might be used as a non-intrusive screener. Measurement challenges common to both surveys are discussed, possible solutions, and the utility of higher-order structures are discussed.",

The Big Six has been proposed as a cross\u2013culturally informed update, and the broader Big Two (Social Self\u2013Regulation and Dynamism) draws on even more cross\u2013cultural evidence. However, neither has been rigorously tested for cross\u2013cultural MI. Here a Big Six inventory (36QB6) and measures of the Big Five and Big Two derived from it were tested and refined for cross\u2013cultural usability in samples from 26 nations, divided into three subsets. Confirmatory factor analysis of the models in the first subset of nations demonstrated fit as strong in translation as typical personality measures achieve in their nation of origin (although poor per standard benchmarks). Items that performed inconsistently across cultures were removed, and alternates considered in a second subset of nations. Fit and invariance were improved for refined 30\u2013item QB6, 25\u2013item Big Five and 14\u2013item Big Two measures in the third subset of nations. For all models, decrease in comparative fit index between MI levels was larger than .01, indicating lack of support for higher levels.

The mainstream body of scholarship on political representation has focused on electoral-based representation in the context of liberal-democratic settings. China provides an excellent case to study the phenomenon of non-electoral forms of political representation. This article seeks to address the question of how do the Chinese authorities enhance political representation by public deliberation in social welfare policy? Drawing on first-hand official documents and interview accounts from fieldwork conducted in Guangxi and Hubei, as well as secondary data sources, this article undertakes a mechanism-based comparative case study of these two localities, examining the different forms of citizen deliberation in poverty alleviation programs. It reveals that the party regime has developed an increasingly sophisticated set of strategies in establishing representation by deliberative consultation. Furthermore, two distinctive forms of deliberative representation, the state-authoritative model and the light-empowered model can be discerned from the different deliberative participatory experiences of Guangxi and Hubei. The deliberative elements introduced into the poverty alleviation program demonstrate that with a deeper and more consequential engagement of the citizens in welfare policy decision making, there can be an empowered form of political representation generated even in a non-electoral setting.",

Evidence from a meta-analysis of conditional cash transfers\nAbstract: Since the 1990s, many governments in middle and low-income countries have used conditional cash transfers to alleviate poverty. However, the evidence of the electoral consequences of this type of anti-poverty intervention remains inconclusive. Do voters reward politicians when they implement conditional cash transfers? This study conducts a meta-analysis using a sample of 10 randomized controlled trials and regression discontinuity designs (35 estimates from six countries in Latin America and Asia) to address this question. The result shows a positive effect of conditional cash transfers on voter support for the incumbents and no evidence of publication bias in the selected sample. Estimated effect sizes tend to be larger in observational studies, unpublished manuscripts, and articles published in political science. These results provide more conclusive evidence that poor voters also respond to non-clientelistic strategies of electoral targeting in developing countries.",

        "document": "Title: Health and social behaviour through pandemic phases in Switzerland: Regional time-trends of the COVID-19 Social Monitor panel study\nAbstract: Background: Switzerland has a liberal implementation of Coronavirus mitigation measures compared to other European countries. Since March 2020, measures have been evolving and include a mixture of central and federalistic mitigation strategies across three culturally diverse language regions. The present study investigates a hypothesised heterogeneity in health, social behavior and adherence to mitigation measures across the language regions by studying pre-specified interaction effects. Our findings aim to support the communication of regionally targeted mitigation strategies and to provide evidence to address longterm population-health consequences of the pandemic by accounting for different pandemic contexts and cultural aspects.\r\nMethods: We use data from from the COVID-19 Social Monitor, a longitudinal population-based online survey. We define five mitigation periods between March 2020 and May 2021. We use unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to investigate a hypothesized interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions on selected study outcomes covering the domains of general health and quality of life, mental health, loneliness/isolation, physical activity, health care use and adherence to mitigation measures.\r\nResults: We analyze 2,163 (64%) participants from the German/Romansh-speaking part of Switzerland, 713 (21%) from the French-speaking part and 505 (15%) from the Italian-speaking part. We found evidence for an interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions for adherence to mitigation measures, but not for other study outcomes (social behavior, health). The presence of poor quality of life, lack of energy, no physical activity, health care use, and the adherence to mitigation measures changed similarly over mitigation periods in all language regions.\r\nDiscussion: As the pandemic unfolded in Switzerland, also health and social behavior changed between March 2020 to May 2021. Changes in adherence to mitigation measures differ between language regions and reflect the COVID-19 incidence patterns in the investigated mitigation periods, with higher adherence in regions with previously higher incidence. Targeted communcation of mitigation measures and policy making should include cultural, geographical and socioeconomic aspects to address yet unknown long-term population health consequences caused by the pandemic.",

To date, little research exists to examine how people in poverty manage their leisure uses of the internet and to what effect on their wellbeing. This study draws on three years of ethnographic fieldwork with unstably housed adults seeking public computer access in northside Chicago. Observations and interviews were conducted at a public library and nonprofit agency where participants relied on public computers partially or fully for internet access. Participants valued public internet access for passing time off the street through entertainment and social media, in addition to more instrumental uses. They frequently translated online leisure activities into social interactions with those around them at access sites, helping facilitate important social bonds by watching videos together, singing along to music, and discussing online content together. The policies and settings of each access site differently enabled the social benefits of digital leisure. The findings contribute to digital inequality research on the leisure divide by illustrating the outcomes for social wellbeing and the importance of local insitutions in shaping leisure uses and outcomes. The value that disadvantaged internet users place on digital leisure and its potential social benefits calls for a reconsideration of how activities are prioritized in inclusion scholarship and efforts.",

Destination countries are found predominantly within Eastern Europe (e.g. Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic), but to a lesser extent also within South-East Asia (e.g. Thailand). At the same time, these expatriations have caused much controversy, with some German commentators calling them \u2018inhumane\u2019 and \u2018shameful\u2019. In this article, I argue that such criticisms are overdrawn. Although sending an older individual to a care home within a lower-income country can be morally impermissible, I find that there are at least three sets of conditions under which it is not.",

This is the case if\u2014but not necessarily only if\u2014(1) a significant proportion of resident citizens do not currently have access to adequate aged and nursing care; (2) the care in the foreign care homes is not worse than the one that is available in domestic care homes; (3) sending states conduct regular checks to ascertain that the level of care abroad is not worse or delegate this task to reliable local monitoring bodies; (4) appropriate measures have been taken to ensure that this type of migration does not harm local residents; and (5) the public money spent on the payments is not better spent on other ways of easing the pressure on domestic care institutions. I end by defending the proposed payments against the objection that they create morally problematic inequalities by exerting greater pressure on members of lower socioeconomic classes to migrate than on their more affluent compatriots.",

However, as many factors influence hemolysis, such tests\u2019 inter- and intralaboratory reproducibility is poor. In this work, CentriMag blood pumps were used to conduct a hemolysis study according to ASTM F1841 with blood from 23 bovine donors. Complementary blood analysis, including cell count, plasma composition, and viscosity, was performed to identify factors relevant to the variability of hemolysis testing results. Three strategies were tested to improve reproducibility: albumin supplementation, maintaining glucose concentration, and replacement of plasma with plasma-like buffer. Differences in red blood cell stability among donors were responsible for the largest portion of the total variance. Hematocrit varied widely among donors, and its adjustment to a standard value led to the artificial introduction of between-donor differences, especially in viscosity. It seems likely, that a more careful selection of donors with similar characteristics or repeated blood collection from the same donor could improve reproducibility. However, no direct correlations were found between the susceptibility to hemolysis and individual donor or blood characteristics in this study. The addition of albumin and glucose had a negligible effect while washing blood samples with artificial plasma significantly reduced mean hemolysis, although not its variation. The findings contribute to the understanding of variability in hemolysis experiments and give reason to question the common standard operating procedures, such as hemodilution or maintaining glucose concentration. To confirm the factors identified here, additional studies isolating the effects of individual factors are necessary.",

Countrywide, specialized neonatal intensive care is provided in one single clinic with markedly limited resources. To implement targeted measures, prospective data on patient characteristics and factors of neonatal death are needed.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nTo determine the rates of morbidity and mortality, to describe clinical characteristics of admitted newborns requiring intensive care, to assess the quality of disease management, and to identify factors contributing to neonatal mortality.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nProspective observational cohort study of newborns admitted to the hospital between mid-February and mid-March 2019 after birth in other institutions. Data were collected on maternal/prenatal history, delivery, and in-hospital care via convenience sampling. Associations of patient characteristics with in-hospital death were assessed using cause-specific Cox proportional-hazards models.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nHalf of the 168 admitted newborns underwent postnatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Reasons for admission included respiratory distress (49.4%), poor postnatal adaptation (45.8%), prematurity (46.2%), and infections (37.1%). 101 newborns (61.2%) arrived in serious/critical general condition; 90 children (53.9%) showed clinical signs of neurological damage. Quality of care was poor: Only 59.4% of the 64 newborns admitted with hypothermia were externally heated; likewise, 57.1% of 45 jaundiced infants did not receive phototherapy. Death occurred in 56 children (33.3%) due to birth asphyxia (42.9%), prematurity (33.9%), and sepsis (12.5%). Newborns in serious/critical general condition at admission had about a fivefold higher hazard to die than those admitted in good condition (HR 5.21 95%-CI 2.42-11.25, p = <0.0001). Hypothermia at admission was also associated with a higher hazard of death (HR 2.00, 95%-CI 1.10-3.65, p = 0.023).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nNeonatal mortality was strikingly high. Birth asphyxia, prematurity, and infection accounted for 89.3% of death, aggravated by poor quality of in-hospital care. Children with serious general condition at admission had poor chances of survival. The whole concept of perinatal care in Guinea requires reconsideration.",

        "document": "Title: Outflow Through Aortic Side Branches Drives False Lumen Patency in Type B Aortic Dissection\nAbstract: Objective: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for type B aortic dissection (TBAD) aims to induce false lumen (FL) thrombosis by sealing intimal tears between the true (TL) and the FL, and blocking the inflow into the FL. Incomplete thrombosis of the FL is correlated with poor clinical outcome. We hypothesize that the number of major and minor branches arising from the FL affects FL patency and may negatively influence TEVAR induced FL thrombosis. Methods: Computed tomography (CT)-scans from 89 patients diagnosed with TBAD [best medical treatment (BMT) n = 52, TEVAR n = 37] from two high-volume vascular surgery centers were analyzed retrospectively. Analysis included evaluation of the FL patency status, the number, location and size of intimal tears, and the presence of minor and major side branches originating from the FL. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate obtained parameters as predictors for FL thrombosis status. Results: In univariate analysis, the strongest correlation for FL patency was found for the number of major (R = 0.79) and minor (R = 0.86) side branches originating from the FL. When applying a multiple linear regression model, the number of major (normalized beta 0.37; P < 0.001) and minor (normalized beta 0.41; P < 0.01) side branches arising from the FL were valid predictors for the axial length of the patent and non-patent FL, and additionally determined the length of the patent FL at 12-month follow-up in patients that underwent TEVAR. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the number of minor side branches that originate from the FL in TBAD is an important determinant of FL patency, to a greater degree than previously assumed.",

Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) employs light and sound to resolve lipid and hemoglobin content, both features associated with plaque instability, in a label-free, fast and highly portable way. Herein, 5 patients with carotid atherosclerosis, 5 healthy volunteers and 2 excised plaques, were scanned with handheld MSOT. Spectral unmixing allowed visualization of lipid and hemoglobin content within three ROIs: whole arterial cross-section, plaque and arterial lumen. Calculation of the fat-blood-ratio (FBR) value within the ROIs enabled the differentiation between patients and healthy volunteers (P = 0.001) and between plaque and lumen in patients (P = 0.04). Our results introduce MSOT as a tool for molecular imaging of human carotid atherosclerosis and open new possibilities for research and clinical assessment of carotid plaques.",

We studied the efficacy and outcomes of combined immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab/nivolumab (Combi-ICI) or targeted therapy (Combi-TT) as first-line treatment in MBM.\r\n\r\nMethods: MBM patients treated with Combi-ICI or Combi-TT within 3 months after MBM diagnosis. Endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\r\n\r\nResults: 53 patients received Combi-ICI, 32% had symptomatic MBM and 33.9% elevated LDH. 71.7% required local treatment. The disease control rate was 60.3%. IC response rate (RR) was 43.8% at 3-months with durable responses at 6- (46.5%) and 12-months (53.1%). Extracranial (EC) RR was 44.7% at 3-months and 50% at 12-months. Median PFS was 9.6 months (95% CI 3.6-NR) and median overall survival (mOS) 44.8 months (95% CI; 26.2-NR). 63 patients received Combi-TT, 55.6% of patients had symptomatic MBM, 57.2% of patients had elevated LDH and 68.3% of patients required local treatment. The disease control rate was 60.4%. ICRR was 50% at 3-months, but dropped at 6-months (20.9%). ECRR was 69.2% at 3-months and 17.6% at 12-months. Median PFS was 5.8 months (95% CI 4.2-7.6) and mOS 14.2 months (95% CI 8.99-26.8). In BRAFV600 patients, 26.7% of patients received Combi-ICI and 73.3% Combi-TT with OS (p = 0.0053) and mPFS (p = 0.03) in favour to Combi-ICI.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Combi-ICI showed prolonged mOS with sustainable IC and EC responses. Despite the initially increased efficacy, Combi-TT responses at 12 months were low. Combi-ICI appeared superior to Combi-TT for OS and PFS in BRAFV600 patients.

In 10% of the cases pulmonary fibrosis even results in an underlying systemic disease. The CTD-ILDs are frequently associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is important to test patients with systemic rheumatic diseases timely and regularly for the presence of an ILD. Treatment decisions should be made together with pneumologists and rheumatologists, particularly with respect to the initiation of a specific treatment. Treatment is based on randomized studies only in a few cases and can mostly be derived from case control studies. For systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSc-ILD) antifibrotic treatment with nintedanib has also now been approved in addition to an immunosuppressive treatment. For other CTD-ILDs an antifibrotic treatment should be discussed in an interdisciplinary approach depending on the underlying disease corresponding to a progressively fibrosing ILD.",

There is a subset of patients that does not respond to available treatments, who present a higher number of exacerbations and a worse quality of life. To understand the mechanisms of poor asthma control and disease severity, we aim to elucidate the metabolic and immunologic routes underlying this specific phenotype and the associated clinical features.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nEighty-seven patients with a clinical history of asthma were recruited and stratified in 4 groups according to their response to treatment: corticosteroid-controlled (ICS), immunotherapy-controlled (IT), biologicals-controlled (BIO) or uncontrolled (UC). Serum samples were analysed by metabolomics and proteomics; and classifiers were built using machine-learning algorithms.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nMetabolomic analysis showed that ICS and UC groups cluster separately from one another and display the highest number of significantly different metabolites among all comparisons. Metabolite identification and pathway enrichment analysis highlighted increased levels of lysophospholipids related to inflammatory pathways in the UC patients. Likewise, 8 proteins were either upregulated (CCL13, ARG1, IL15 and TNFRSF12A) or downregulated (sCD4, CCL19 and IFN\u03b3) in UC patients compared to ICS, suggesting a significant activation of T cells in these patients. Finally, the machine-learning model built including metabolomic and clinical data was able to classify the patients with an 87.5% accuracy.\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nUC patients display a unique fingerprint characterized by inflammatory-related metabolites and proteins, suggesting a pro-inflammatory environment.

Our aims were to examine whether there were any differences in the level of physical activity and daily TV attendance, to assess its role on asthma control and immune responses to various immune stimulants.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nWeekly physical activity and daily television attendance were obtained from questionnaires at inclusion of the PreDicta study. PBMC cultures were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), R848, poly I:C, and zymosan. A panel of cytokines was measured and quantified in cell culture supernatants using luminometric multiplex immunofluorescence beads-based assay.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nAsthmatic preschoolers showed significantly more TV attendance than their healthy peers (58.6% vs. 41.5% 1\u20133 h daily and only 25.7% vs. 47.2% \u22641 h daily) and poor asthma control was associated with less frequent physical activity (PA) (75% no or occasional activity in uncontrolled vs. 20% in controlled asthma; 25% \u22653 times weekly vs. 62%). Asthmatics with increased PA exhibited elevated cytokine levels in response to polyclonal stimulants, suggesting a readiness of circulating immune cells for type 1, 2, and 17 cytokine release compared to subjects with low PA and high TV attendance. This may also represent a proinflammatory state in high PA asthmatic children. Low physical activity and high TV attendance were associated with a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines were correlating with each other in in vitro immune responses of asthmatic children, but not healthy controls, this correlation was more pronounced in children with sedentary behavior.\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nAsthmatic children show more sedentary behavior than healthy subjects, while poor asthma control is associated with a substantial decrease in physical activity. Our results suggest that asthmatic children may profit from regular exercise, as elevated cytokine levels in stimulated conditions indicate an immune system prepared for responding strongly in case of different types of infections. However, it has to be considered that a hyperinflammatory state in high PA may not be beneficial in asthmatic children.",

Such crises can lead people to feel that others are a threat. Here, we show that the initial phase of the pandemic in 2020 increased individuals' paranoia and made their belief updating more erratic. A proactive lockdown made people's belief updating less capricious. However, state-mandated mask-wearing increased paranoia and induced more erratic behaviour. This was most evident in states where adherence to mask-wearing rules was poor but where rule following is typically more common. Computational analyses of participant behaviour suggested that people with higher paranoia expected the task to be more unstable. People who were more paranoid endorsed conspiracies about mask-wearing and potential vaccines and the QAnon conspiracy theories. These beliefs were associated with erratic task behaviour and changed priors. Taken together, we found that real-world uncertainty increases paranoia and influences laboratory task behaviour.",

While it usually has an excellent prognosis, a subset of patients (5%) develops nodal metastasis and has poor outcomes. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature and evaluate the prognostic factors of HNCSCC in order to better understand which patients are the most likely to develop metastatic disease.\r\n\r\nMethods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed and EMBASE to identify the studies that evaluated the prognostic factors of HNCSCC. Prognostic factors were deemed significant if they had a reported p-value of < 0.05. Proportions of studies that reported a given factor to be statistically significant were calculated for each prognostic factor.\r\n\r\nResults: The search yielded a total of 958 citations. Forty studies, involving a total of 8535 patients, were included in the final analysis. The pre-operative/clinical prognostic factors with the highest proportion of significance were state of immunosuppression (73.3%) and age (53.3%); while post-operative/pathological prognostic factors of importance were number of lymph nodes involved with carcinoma (70.0%), margins involved with carcinoma (66.7%), and tumor depth (50.0%).\r\n\r\nConclusion: This systematic review is aimed to aid physicians in assessing the prognosis of HNCSCC and identifying the subsets of patients that are most susceptible to metastasis. It also suggests that immunosuppressed patients with a high-risk feature on biopsy, such as invasion beyond subcutaneous fat, could possibly benefit from a sentinel lymph node biopsy.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Carcinoma; Mohs surgery; Sentinel lymph node biopsy; Skin neoplasms; Squamous cell; Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck.",

We aimed (1) to describe survivors' wellbeing, impact of cancer, and supportive care needs and (2) to determine how socio-demographic or clinical characteristics and impact of cancer relate to survivors' unmet needs.\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\n\r\nIn this mixed methods study, a quantitative survey was used to assess HRQOL, psychological distress, impact of cancer, and supportive care needs. Qualitative interviews were conducted to explore the meaning of wellbeing, health, and impact of cancer.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOverall, 69 CCS participated in the survey of which 28 participated in qualitative interviews (aged\u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years, diagnosed with cancer\u2009\u2264\u200918\u00a0years). Few CCS (13%) reported poor physical HRQOL, but almost half reported poor mental HRQOL (49%) and psychological distress (42%). Health was considered to encompass both: physical and emotional aspects of wellbeing. Cancer positively impacted CCS' ability to care and attitude towards life, whereas relationships and insurance were negatively impacted. Risks for unmet needs increased in CCS with self-reported low health status, late effects, psychological distress, with older age at study or longer time since end of treatment.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn our study, many CCS experienced various psychosocial, psychological and informational unmet needs, indicating that survivors' needs are currently not duly addressed. Current efforts to provide supportive psychosocial care in Switzerland should be further operationalized to provide adequate support.",

They are highly efficacious and generally well tolerated. Vaccination in patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases is recommended. A number of cases with de novo or relapsing glomerulonephritis shortly after vaccine application were reported, some of which presented with gross hematuria.\r\nMethods: We collected 10 cases of macrohematuria following mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at our tertiary care institution and referring centers. Additionally we pooled all 25 published cases from the literature with ours to analyse their clinical characteristics.\r\nResults: Most macrohematuria episodes (72.2%) began within 2 days after vaccination, the majority after the second dose. In some individuals, repeated episodes occured after subsequent doses of the same vaccine. 65.7% of patients never had macrohematuria before. 45.7% were known to suffer from IgAN, the rest had no prior renal diagnosis. IgAN was the most frequent new diagnosis but ANCA-associated vasculitis and anti-GBM disease were also identified. AKI occurred in 28.6% of patients, a rise in serum creatinine not meeting KDIGO AKI criteria in 28.6%. Treatment ranged from conservative management, RAAS-inhibitors, steroids and cyclophosphamide to plasmapheresis. While renal outcomes were mainly favourable in isolated IgAN, they were poor in patients with additional or isolated small vessel vasculitis.\r\nConclusion: Awareness of gross hematuria after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is important. Close follow-up and additional work-up in particular in individuals without known underlying kidney disease or worsening renal function is essential. For patients with vaccine associated macrohematuria an alternative vaccine class might be considered for subsequent vaccinations.",

In addition, prognostic studies are overall methodologically poor, based on small data sets and explore only limited numbers of influencing factors. We aim to develop prognostic models for individual ARCR patients, primarily for the patient-reported assessment of shoulder function (Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS)) and the occurrence of shoulder stiffness 6 months after surgery. We also aim to evaluate the use of a consensus core event set (CES) for AEs and validate a severity classification for these events, considering the patient's perspective.\r\n\r\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA cohort of 970 primary ARCR patients will be prospectively documented from several Swiss and German orthopaedic clinics up to 24 months postoperatively. Patient clinical examinations at 6 and 12 months will include shoulder range of motion and strength (Constant Score). Tendon repair integrity status will be assessed by ultrasound at 12 months. Patient-reported questionnaires at 6, 12 and 24 months will determine functional scores (subjective shoulder value, OSS), anxiety and depression scores, working status, sports activities, and quality of life (European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level questionnaire). AEs will be documented according to a CES. Prognostic models will be developed using an internationally supported regression methodology. Multiple prognostic factors, including patient baseline demographics, psychological, socioeconomic and clinical factors, rotator cuff integrity, concomitant local findings, and (post)operative management factors, will be investigated.\r\n\r\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\r\n\r\nThis project contributes to the development of personalised risk predictions for supporting the surgical decision process in ARCR. The consensus CES may become an international reference for the reporting of complications in clinical studies and registries.

The objective of this study was to study a cohort of satisfied patients after RTSA who had comparable active mobility except for fIR and to identify factors associated with selective loss of fIR.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare 2 patient groups with either poor (\u2264 2 points in the Constant-Murley score [CS]) or excellent (\u22658 points in CS) fIR after RTSA at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Influencing factors (demographic, surgical or implant related, radiographic parameters) and clinical outcome were analyzed.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nFifty-two patients with a mean age of 72.8 (\u00b19.3) and a mean follow-up of 41 months were included in the IR\u22642 group and 63 patients with a mean age of 72.1 (\u00b18.0) and a mean follow-up of 59 months in the IR\u22658 group. All patients had undergone RTSA with the same implant type and only 2 different glenosphere sizes (36 and 40) for comparable indications. A multivariate analysis identified the following significant risk factors for poor postoperative fIR: poor preoperative fIR (pts in CS: 3 [range: 2-6] vs. 6 [range: 4-8], P<.0001), smoking (17.3% vs. 6.5%, P = .004), male gender (59.6% vs. 31.7%, P = .002), less preoperative to postoperative distalization of the greater tuberosity (\u0394 19.4 mm vs. 22.2 mm, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026), a thin humeral insert (\u22643 mm: 23.1% vs. 54.8%, P = .039), and a high American Society of Anesthesiologists score (\u2264 III: 30.8% vs. 14.3%, P = .043). Subscapularis repair status and glenosphere size had no influence on fIR. Clinical outcome scores improved in both groups from preoperatively to last follow-up. The IR\u22658 group had overall significantly better outcome scores compared to the IR\u22642 group (\u0394 9.3% SSV and \u0394 9.5% relative CS, P < .0001). There was no difference in CS between the cohorts when the score for fIR was discarded.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIndependent risk factors for poor postoperative fIR after RTSA are poor preoperative fIR, smoking, male gender, less preoperative to postoperative distalization of the greater tuberosity, a thin humeral insert height, and a high American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Except for male gender, these factors are modifiable. These findings may be a valuable addition to patient counselling as well as preoperative planning and preoperative and intraoperative decision-making. The relevance of fIR for overall satisfaction is substantiated by this study.",

It was the purpose of this investigation to evaluate the results of a pilot study involving glenoid resurfacing with a glenoid allograft combined with a hemiarthroplasty on the humeral side.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nBetween April 2011 to November 2013, 5 patients (3 men, 2 women, mean age 46.4, range 35-57) with advanced OA of the glenohumeral joint, were treated with a humeral head replacement combined with replacement of the glenoid surface with an osteochondral, glenoid allograft.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOverall, clinically, there was one excellent, one satisfactory and three poor results. Mean preoperative subjective shoulder value (SSV) was 34% (range: 20-50%) and preoperative relative Constant-Murley-Score (CSr) was 43 points (range: 29-64 points). Three patients with poor results had to be revised within the first three years. Their mean pre-revision SSV and CSr were 38% (range: 15-80%) and 36 points (range: 7-59 points) respectively. One patient was revised 9 years after the primary procedure with advanced glenoid erosion and pain and one patient has an ongoing satisfactory outcome without revision. Their SSVs were 60% and 83%, their CSr were 65 points and 91 points, 9 and 10 years after the primary procedure, respectively. Mean follow-up was 7 years (2-10 years) and mean time to revision was 4 years (range: 1-9 years).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe in-vivo pilot study of a previously established in-vitro technique of osteochondral glenoid allograft combined with humeral HA led to three early failures and only one really satisfactory clinical outcome which, however, was associated with advanced glenoid erosion. Osteochondral allograft glenoid resurfacing was associated with an unacceptable early failure rate and no results superior to those widely documented for HA or TSA, so that the procedure has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\r\n\r\nLevel IV, Case Series, Treatment Study.",

Main outcome measure was the Nottwil Environmental Factors Inventory-Short Form. Random-effects Poisson regression featuring between-within estimation was used to examine predictors of the number of environmental barriers and of its change over time.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: One thousand five hundred and forty-nine persons participated in Survey 2012 and 1530 participated in Survey 2017; 761 participated in both surveys. In both surveys most participants reported at least three barriers. Leading issues were unfavorable climate, inaccessibility of buildings and public spaces, and lack of or insufficiently adapted means of transportation. Reporting of barriers related to climate, finances, and state services declined over time. Between subjects, having more health problems, lesser physical independence, poorer mental health, and a lower household income were related to a higher number of barriers experienced. Within subjects, improvements in income, physical independence, and mental health over time were related to a reduction in barriers.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Inaccessibility of buildings and places and problems with transportation remained major barriers over a 5-year period and should be priorities of Swiss disability policy. People with reduced mental and physical health, and those with lower income are vulnerable groups deserving specific attention. Policies targeting income and life-long rehabilitation targeting health promotion and maintenance may be suitable means to reduce the experience of environmental barriers.",

Clinical symptoms, neurological status using Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measurement (PSOM) and degree of disability on modified Rankin scale score (mRS) were evaluated. MRI-MRA evaluation included the assessment of ischemic lesions and involvement of posterior circulation. Data were analyzed for moyamoya disease (MMD), moyamoya syndrome (MMS) and age at disease onset.\r\nResults\r\nStroke was a common presentation in both MMD and MMS patients. TIAs and headaches/migraine were more frequent in MMD. There was no evidence of a difference in stroke burden on MRI as well as in PCA involvement between the two subgroups. Children <2 years had higher odds of having a stroke (OR 15.5, 95% CI 3.8\u201362.4, p < 0.001), recurrent stroke (OR 11.8, 95%CI 2.9\u201346.7, p < 0.001) and unfavorable mRS (\u22652) (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.3\u201313.7, p = 0.01) when compared to those >5 years of age. There was some evidence of association of PCA involvement with recurrent strokes (OR 3.1, CI 1.0\u20139.6, p = 0.05), a poor PSOM (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.1\u20138.2, p = 0.04) and mRS (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2\u20138.3, p = 0.02).\r\nConclusion\r\nStroke seems to be a common presentation in both MMD and MMS patients. Early age at symptom onset and involvement of posterior circulation seem to be important risk factors for a high stroke burden and an unfavorable PSOM and mRS.",

Results of clinical trials, with three-year event-free and overall survival as primary outcomes, often take 7 to 10 years. Identification of an early surrogate biomarker, predictive for survival, is therefore crucial. We conducted a systematic review to define the prognostic value of early tumor size response in children with IRSG group III rhabdomyosarcoma. The search included MEDLINE/EMBASE from inception to 18 November 2020. In total, six studies were included, describing 2010 patients, and assessed by the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) instrument. Four studies found no prognostic value for tumor size response, whereas two studies reported a prognostic effect. In these two studies, the survival rate of patients with progressive disease was not separately analyzed from patients with stable disease, potentially explaining the difference in study outcome. In conclusion, our findings support that early progression of disease is associated with poorer survival, justifying adaptation of therapy. However, in patients with non-progressive disease, there is no evidence that the degree of response is a prognostic marker for survival. Because the vast majority of patients do not have progressive disease, early tumor size response should be reconsidered for assessment of treatment efficacy. Therefore, at present, early surrogate biomarkers for survival are still lacking.",

We evaluated response, survival and prognostic factors after a second relapse of AML. Among 1222 pediatric patients of the population-based AML-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) study group (2004 until 2017), 73 patients met the quality parameters for inclusion in this study. Central review of source documentation warranted the accuracy of reported data. Treatment approaches included palliation in 17 patients (23%), intensive therapy with curative intent (n = 46, 63%) and other regimens (n = 10). Twenty-five patients (35%) received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 21 of whom (88%) had a prior HSCT. Survival was poor, with a five-year probability of overall survival (pOS) of 15 \u00b1 4% and 31 \u00b1 9% following HSCT (n = 25). Early second relapse (within one year after first relapse) was associated with dismal outcome (pOS 2 \u00b1 2%, n = 44 vs. 33 \u00b1 9%, n = 29; p < 0.0001). A third complete remission (CR) is required for survival: 31% (n = 14) of patients with intensive treatment achieved a third CR with a pOS of 36 \u00b1 13%, while 28 patients (62%) were non-responders (pOS 7 \u00b1 5%). In conclusion, survival is poor but possible, particularly after a late second relapse and an intensive chemotherapy followed by HSCT. This analysis provides a baseline for future treatment planning.",

Similar retinal microvascular changes were observed in Alzheimer\u2019s and chronic stressed individuals. Hence, we aimed to show that chronic stress relates to T3D dementia signs and retinopathy, ultimately comprising a Stress syndrome prototype reflecting risk for T3D and stroke. A chronic stress and stroke risk phenotype (Stressed) score, independent of age, race or gender, was applied to stratify participants (N = 264; aged 44 \u00b1 9 years) into high stress risk (Stressed, N = 159) and low stress risk (non-Stressed, N = 105) groups. We determined insulin resistance using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), which is interchangeable with T3D, and dementia risk markers (cognitive executive functioning (cognitiveexe-func); telomere length; waist circumference (WC), neuronal glia injury; neuron-specific enolase/NSE, S100B). Retinopathy was determined in the mydriatic eye. The Stressed group had greater incidence of HOMA-IR in the upper quartile (\u22655), larger WC, poorer cognitiveexe-func control, shorter telomeres, consistently raised neuronal glia injury, fewer retinal arteries, narrower arteries, wider veins and a larger optic cup/disc ratio (C/D) compared to the non-Stressed group. Furthermore, of the stroke risk markers, arterial narrowing was related to glaucoma risk with a greater C/D, whilst retinal vein widening was related to HOMA-IR, poor cognitiveexe-func control and neuronal glia injury (Adjusted R2 0.30; p \u2264 0.05). These associations were not evident in the non-Stressed group. Logistic regression associations between the Stressed phenotype and four dementia risk markers (cognitiveexe-func, telomere length, NSE and WC) comprised a Stress syndrome prototype (area under the curve 0.80; sensitivity/specificity 85%/58%; p \u2264 0.001). The Stress syndrome prototype reflected risk for HOMA-IR (odds ratio (OR) 7.72) and retinal glia ischemia (OR 1.27) and vein widening (OR 1.03). The Stressed phenotype was associated with neuronal glia injury and retinal ischemia, potentiating glaucoma risk. The detrimental effect of chronic stress exemplified a Stress syndrome prototype reflecting risk for type 3 diabetes, neurodegeneration and ischemic stroke.",

Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients demonstrated a low diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) with preserved lung volumes at baseline, suggesting the presence of combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) in some patients. This post hoc analysis of RISE-IIP was undertaken to explore lung morphology, assessed by high-resolution computed tomography, and associated clinical outcomes.\r\nMethods\r\nAvailable baseline/pre-baseline high-resolution computed tomography scans were reviewed centrally by 2 radiologists. The extent of emphysema and fibrosis was retrospectively scored and combined to provide the total CPFE score.\r\nResults\r\nData were available for 65/147 patients (44%), including 15/27 fatal cases (56%). Of these, 41/65 patients (63%) had CPFE. Mortality was higher in patients with CPFE (12/41; 29%) than those without (3/24; 13%). Fourteen patients with CPFE had emphysema > fibrosis (4 died). No relationship was observed between CPFE score, survival status, and treatment assignment. A low DLCO, short 6-min walking distance, and high forced vital capacity:DLCO ratio at baseline also appeared to be risk factors for mortality.\r\nConclusions\r\nHigh parenchymal lung disease burden and the presence of more emphysema than fibrosis might have predisposed patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia to poor outcomes in RISE-IIP.

A growing body of literature has linked the constructs of the triarchic model of psychopathy (boldness, meanness, disinhibition) to the FFM. Recently, researchers developed both item and regression-based measures of the triarchic model of psychopathy using the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised-a popular measure of the FFM. The current study examines the correlates of these two FFM-derived operationalizations of the triarchic model using data from the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study. The two approaches had strong convergent validity coefficients and similar patterns of criterion-related validity coefficients. Meanness related to greater personality pathology characterized by exploitation of others and poor attachment, whereas disinhibition related to indicators of greater negative affect and poor behavioral constraint. Boldness related to reduced negative affect and greater narcissistic personality traits. Although the item and regression-based approaches showed similar patterns of associations with criterion-variables, the item-based approach has some practical and psychometric advantages over the regression-based approach given strong correlations between the meanness and disinhibition scores from the regression approach.",

        "document": "Title: Redistributive preferences: Why actual income is ultimately more important than perceived income\nAbstract: An emerging consensus claims that \u2018subjective\u2019 (mis)perceptions of income inequality better explain redistributive preferences than actual \u2018objective\u2019 conditions. In this article, we critically re-assess this view. We compare perceived and actual income positions as predictors for preferences for redistribution. We argue that perceived income is partly endogenous to actual income and its effect on preferences conditional on ideology. Using an original survey experiment from Switzerland, we show that the predictive power of perceived income is lower compared to actual income. Perceived income is only associated with redistribution preferences among centre-right respondents, but not among left-wing respondents. Furthermore, providing respondents with corrective information about their true position in the income hierarchy has no effect on redistribution preferences. These findings go against the new consensus about the superior explanatory power of subjective perceptions of income inequality. We argue instead that absolute objective conditions should be at the centre of explaining redistributive preferences.",

Randomizing decision-makers in Kampala, Uganda to view weight-manipulated portraits, I make four findings. First, obesity is perceived as a reliable signal of wealth rather than beauty and health. Second, being obese facilitates access to credit: in a real-stakes experiment involving loan officers, the obesity premium is comparable to raising borrower self-reported earnings by 60%. Third, asymmetric information drives this premium, which drops significantly when more financial information is provided. Fourth, obesity benefits and wealth-signaling value are commonly overestimated, raising the cost of healthy behaviors.",

Quality of studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale. The primary outcome was the odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence intervals [95%CI]) of PPD in women with vs. without PCOS. Meta-regression analyses included the effects of age, body mass index, percent smokers, history of depression, preterm delivery, hypertension during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and cesarian section as well as subgroup analyses based on the assessment methods for PCOS and PPD. Sensitivity analyses after excluding poor quality studies and cross-sectional studies and sequentially excluding each study were performed.\r\n\r\nResults: One study was rated as good, two as fair and three as low-quality. In six studies (n = 934,922), 44,167 women with PCOS were at increased PPD risk compared to 890,755 women without PCOS (OR= 1.45, 95%CI= 1.18 to 1.79, p< 0.001). When excluding one study that underestimated PCOS prevalence, we estimated an OR of 1.59 (95%CI= 1.56 to 1.62, p< 0.001) with reduced heterogeneity (I2= 45.3%). Higher ORs of PPD in women with PCOS were moderated by lower percentage of preterm delivery (co-efficient -0.07, 95%CI= -0.1 to -0.04, p< 0.001). After excluding low-quality studies yielded an OR of 1.58 (95%CI= 1.56 to 1.59, p< 0.001) with heterogeneity dropping (I2= 14.0%).\r\n\r\nLimitations: The methodological heterogeneity of available studies.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Women with PCOS are at elevated PPD risk with risk moderators requiring further research.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Mood disorders; Perinatal mental health; Polycystic ovarian syndrome; Postpartum depression; Preterm delivery.",

Poisson regression adjusting for baseline confounders investigated the interaction between current CD4+/viral load strata [good (CD4+ cell count \u2265500\u200acells/\u03bcl and viral load <200\u200acopies/ml], poor [CD4+ cell count \u2264350\u200acells/\u03bcl and viral load >200\u200acopies/ml] and intermediate [all other combinations]), smoking status and all cancers, non-AIDS defining cancers (NADCs), smoking-related cancers (SRCs) and infection-related cancers (IRCs).\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOut of 19\u200a602 persons, 41.3% were never smokers, 44.4% current and 14.4% previous smokers at baseline. CD4+/viral load strata were poor in 3.4%, intermediate in 44.8% and good in 51.8%. There were 513 incident cancers; incidence rate 6.9/1000 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 6.3-7.5]. Current smokers had higher incidence of all cancer (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.45; 1.17-1.79), NADC (1.65; 1.31-2.09), SRC (2.21; 1.53-3.20) and IRC (1.38; 0.97-1.96) vs. never smokers. Those with poor CD4+/viral load had increased incidence of all cancer (5.36; 95% CI 3.71-7.75), NADC (3.14; 1.92-5.14), SRC (1.82; 0.76-4.41) and IRC (10.21; 6.06-17.20) vs. those with good CD4+/viral load. There was no evidence that the association between smoking and cancer subtypes differed depending on the CD4+/viral load strata (P\u200a>\u200a0.1, test for interaction).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn the large RESPOND consortium, the impact of smoking on cancer was clear and reducing smoking rates should remain a priority. The association between current immune deficiency, virological control and cancer was similar for never smokers, current smokers and previous smokers suggesting similar carcinogenic effects of smoking regardless of CD4+ cell count and viral load.",

        "document": "Title: Health Literacy in the Canton of Zurich: First Results of a Representative Study\nAbstract: Managing health information and services is difficult for nearly half of the population in Switzerland. Low health literacy has been shown to result in poorer health and health outcomes as well as a higher utilization of health services. To date, studies on health literacy in Switzerland have focused on a national level. However, Switzerland is a federal state with 26 cantons and a strongly decentralized health system. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand how health literacy is distributed within the population of the canton of Zurich specifically, and to develop methods to determine whether an individual has a higher or lower level of health literacy. There were a total of 1000 participants in this representative study. Data was collected by an adapted version of the HLS-EU-Q47 and additional sociodemographic questions. The majority (56%) of the reported difficulties concerned accessing, understanding, appraising, and applying health information. The findings confirm that health literacy follows a social gradient, whereby financially deprived individuals and those with a low educational level report lower health literacy. The need for action to strengthen the health literacy of these population groups is therefore urgent. Interventions should pay particular attention to these vulnerable groups and tailor resolutions to their needs and preferences.",

We therefore assessed seroprevalence and identified risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity in this population.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nBetween 22 June 22 and 15 August 2020, HCWs from institutions in northern/eastern Switzerland were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We recorded baseline characteristics, non-occupational and occupational risk factors. We used pairwise tests of associations and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with seropositivity.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nAmong 4664 HCWs from 23 healthcare facilities, 139 (3%) were seropositive. Non-occupational exposures independently associated with seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-positive household (adjusted OR 59, 95% CI 33-106), stay in a COVID-19 hotspot (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) and male sex (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1). Blood group 0 vs. non-0 (aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8), active smoking (aOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.7), living with children <12\u00a0years (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) and being a physician (aOR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5) were associated with decreased risk. Other occupational risk factors were close contact to COVID-19 patients (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.4), exposure to COVID-19-positive co-workers (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), poor knowledge of standard hygiene precautions (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) and frequent visits to the hospital canteen (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.8).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nLiving with COVID-19-positive households showed the strongest association with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. We identified several potentially modifiable work-related risk factors, which might allow mitigation of the COVID-19 risk among HCWs. The lower risk among those living with children, even after correction for multiple confounders, is remarkable and merits further study.",

Indications and types of reoperations vary widely and postoperative complication rates are higher compared to primary BS.\r\n\r\nMethods: Out of 44,884 BS performed in 18 high-volume centers from 4 continents between 06/2013-05/2019, 5,349 (12%) secondary BS cases were identified. Twenty-one outcome benchmarks were established in low-risk patients, defined as the 75th percentile of the median outcome values of centers. Benchmark cases had no previous laparotomy, diabetes, sleep apnea, cardiopathy, renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, immunosuppression, thromboembolic events, BMI> 50 kg/m2 or age> 65 years.\r\n\r\nResults: The benchmark cohort included 3143 cases, mainly females (85%), aged 43.8 \u00b1 10 years, 8.4 \u00b1 5.3 years after primary BS, with a BMI 35.2 \u00b1 7 kg/m2. Main indications were insufficient weight loss (43%) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease/dysphagia (25%). 90-days postoperatively, 14.6% of benchmark patients presented \u22651 complication, mortality was 0.06% (n = 2). Significantly higher morbidity was observed in non-benchmark cases (OR 1.37) and after conversional/reversal or revisional procedures with gastrointestinal suture/stapling (OR 1.84). Benchmark cutoffs for conversional BS were \u22644.5% re-intervention, \u22648.3% re-operation 90-days postoperatively. At 2-years (IQR 1-3) 15.6% of benchmark patients required a reoperation.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Secondary BS is safe, although postoperative morbidity exceeds the established benchmarks for primary BS. The excess morbidity is due to an increased risk of gastrointestinal leakage and higher need for intensive care. The considerable rate of tertiary BS warrants expertise and future research to optimize the management of non-success after BS.",

Reported HSCT outcomes have improved over time with respect to overall survival, but some studies have identified older age and HSCT from alternative donors as risk factors predicting poorer outcome. We analyzed 197 patients transplanted at EBMT centers between 2006 and 2017, who received conditioning as recommended by the inborn errors working party (IEWP): either busulfan (n=103) or treosulfan (n=94) combined with fludarabine \u00b1 thiotepa. After a median follow-up after HSCT of 44.9 months, 176 patients were alive, resulting in a 3-year overall survival of 88.7%, and chronic GVHD-free survival (CRFS; events: death, graft failure, severe chronic GVHD) of 81.7%. Overall survival and CRFS were not significantly impacted by conditioning regimen (busulfan- versus treosulfan-based), donor type (MSD/MFD vs MUD/MMUD vs. MMFD), and period of HSCT (2006-2013 vs. 2014-2017). Patients younger than 5 years at HSCT had a significantly better overall survival. The overall cumulative incidences of grade III-IV acute GVHD and extensive/moderate/severe chronic GVHD were 6.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Patients receiving treosulfan-based conditioning had a higher incidence of graft failure, mixed donor chimerism and more frequently received secondary procedures (2nd HSCT, unconditioned stem cell boost, donor lymphocyte infusion, or splenectomy). In summary, HSCT for WAS with conditioning regimens currently recommended by IEWP results in excellent survival and low rates of GVHD, regardless of donor or stem cell source, but age \u22655 years remains a risk factor for overall survival.",

The system of microfinancing is becoming an important mechanism against poverty and social exclusion in Europe. However, there is available very limited legal, regulatory and historical information on the microfinance system in the Czech Republic. As a result, microfinance institutions are absent and small entrepreneurs tend to use expensive consumer credit products, thereby increasing the risk of over-indebtedness. The aim of this research is to examine the repayment performance of the European microfinance institutions with increased share of clients from rural areas. Based on an empirical statistical analysis of an unique European microfinance institutions' database, we are presenting evidence that suggests that microfinance systems perform better in rural than in urban areas. This finding is strongly recommended for consideration in the development of policies to guide legal frameworks regarding microfinancing.\r\nKeywords Microfinancing industry, quality of portfolio, rural economic development, social capital.",

Here, we tested if depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with poor sleep and lower general health, and if social support mediated these associations. Furthermore, we compared current insomnia scores and general health scores with normative data. A total of 321 full-time frontline hospital staff members (mean age: 36.86; 58% females) took part in the study during the COVID-19 pandemic. They completed a series of questionnaires covering demographic and work-related information, symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, social support, self-efficacy, and symptoms of insomnia and general health. Higher symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with higher symptoms of insomnia and lower general health. Higher scores of depression, anxiety, and stress directly predicted higher insomnia scores and lower general health scores, while the indirect effect of social support was modest. Compared to normative data, full-time frontline hospital staff members had a 3.14 higher chance to complain about insomnia and a significantly lower general health. Symptoms of insomnia and general health were unrelated to age, job experience, educational level, and gender. Given this background, it appears that the working context had a lower impact on individuals\u2019 well-being compared to individual characteristics.",

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that past non-suicidal self-injury was associated with current non-suicidal self-injury and with current subjective sleep patterns. To this end, a larger sample of young adults were assessed. A total of 2374 adults (mean age: 27.58 years; 39.6% females) completed a series of self-rating questionnaires covering sociodemographic information, past and current NSSIs, suicide attempts, and current sleep patterns, including experiencing nightmares. Past NSSIs predicted current NSSIs. Current sleep patterns had a modest impact on the association between past and current NSSIs. Compared to male participants, female participants did not report more sleep complaints or more current NSSIs, but more past NSSIs. Past NSSIs predicted the occurrences of nightmares and suicide attempts. The best predictor of current NSSI was the remembered past NSSI, while current poor sleep was only modestly associated with current NSSI. Further indicators of current NSSI and poor sleep were suicide attempts and nightmares within the last six months. Overall, it appears that poor emotion regulation should be considered as underlying factor to trigger and maintain non-suicidal self-injury-related behavior and poor sleep. Further, unlike previous studies, which focused on the possible influence of sleep patterns on NSSIs, the aim of the present study paradigm was to investigate NSSIs on sleep patterns.",

However, little is known about the role of this route of administration in heroin-assisted treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of IM diacetylmorphine administration and associated complications as well as to explore patients\u2019 views and opinions on the topic and the underlying reasons for this practice.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nThe research site was a Swiss outpatient treatment centre specialised in heroin-assisted treatment. We conducted in-depth interviews with two patients who intramuscularly inject diacetylmorphine. Interviews were analysed qualitatively, and emerging themes were used to develop a 38-item questionnaire on IM injections. We then offered this questionnaire to all patients in the treatment centre.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nFive main themes emerged from the in-depth interviews: poor venous access, side effects, subjective effects, procedure for IM injection, and consideration of alternatives to IM. These themes covered the rationale for using this route of administration, complications, subjective effects of IM diacetylmorphine, hygiene and safety measures as well as alternative routes of administration. Fifty-three patients filled in the questionnaire. The lifetime prevalence of IM injections was 60.4% (n\u2009=\u200932) and 34.4% (n\u2009=\u200911) of the patients stated that IM injection was their primary route of administration. No participant reported using the IM route for street drugs. The main reason for IM injections was poor vein access. Other reasons given were time saving and less risk of injuries. Complications included induration of muscle tissue and pain, whereas more severe complications like thrombosis and infections of the injection site were reported much less often.\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nAs the population of opioid-dependent individuals is aging and the deterioration of access veins is likely to increase, the frequency of IM injecting will equally increase. Even though our data show that the IM injection of diacetylmorphine in a clinical setting is a common practice and appears to be relatively safe, research on alternative routes of administration is needed to provide potentially less harmful alternative routes of administration in heroin-assisted treatment.",

The 3-mo stone-free rate and mean residual stone size were, respectively, 61% and 1.8\u2009mm after URS and 48% and 2.4\u2009mm after SWL. Early post-treatment pain scores were significantly higher after URS than after SWL on day 1 (3.3 vs 1.6, p\u2009=\u2009 0.02) and day 7 (5.2 vs 3.4, p\u2009=\u2009 0.04), but were no longer detectable after 3 wk and 3 mo, respectively.

        "document": "Title: Time in Nature Associated with Decreased Fatigue in UK Truck Drivers\nAbstract: Heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driving is recognised as a highly hazardous occupation due to the long periods of sedentary behaviour, low levels of physical activity and unhealthy food options when working. These risk factors combine with shift work and concomitant irregular sleep patterns to increase the prevalence of fatigue. Fatigue is closely linked with stress and, subsequently, poor physiological and psychological health. In parallel, a wealth of evidence has demonstrated the health and wellbeing benefits of spending time in nature. Here, we sought to examine whether spending time in nature was associated with lower levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression in HGV drivers. 89 long-distance drivers (98.9% male, mean \u00b1 SD age: 51.0 \u00b1 9 years, body mass index: 29.8 \u00b1 4.7 kg/m2) participating in a wider health promotion programme reported time spent in nature (during and before the Covid-19 pandemic) and symptoms of occupational fatigue, depression and anxiety. After controlling for covariates, truck drivers who visited nature at least once a week exhibited 16% less chronic fatigue prior to the pandemic, and 23% less chronic fatigue and 20% less acute fatigue during the pandemic. No significant differences were observed for either anxiety or depression. As fatigue has a range of physical and mental health sequelae, we propose that increased exposure to natural settings may make a valuable contribution to interventions to promote the health and wellbeing of this underserved group.",

However, the relevance of apoD in respect to cardiovascular risk is largely unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the ability of apoD to predict future all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nSerum apoD levels were measured in a cohort of 531 Caucasian individuals who underwent coronary angiography (356 males, 175 females; mean age 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 years). Fatal and non-fatal events were recorded over a median follow-up period of 5.8 years.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nApoD concentrations at baseline correlated significantly with age, presence of the metabolic syndrome, body mass index, lipoprotein levels, fasting glucose, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Kaplan-Meier curve analyses by gender-stratified quartiles of apoD revealed that the cumulative incidence rates of mortality and cardiovascular events become higher with increasing apoD levels. The adjusted hazard ratios for participants in the highest quartile of apoD compared to those in the lowest quartile were 4.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-10.74) for overall mortality, 5.47 (95% CI 1.20-25.00) for cardiovascular mortality, and 2.52 (95% CI 1.28-5.00) for cardiovascular events.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nHigh circulating levels of apoD are an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with suspected or established coronary artery disease.",

It is well established that unrelieved suffering of any kind is associated with poor quality of life and care outcomes. Several barriers to psychiatric involvement with this population exist; however, mental health specialists have increasingly developed ways to provide their expertise to the care of seriously ill patients. Palliative care psychiatry is an emerging subspecialty at the intersection of palliative care and psychiatry. Effective management of psychosocial and psychiatric issues often enables improvements in other domains, including physical distress, quality of life, and care outcomes. Physician assistants can contribute meaningfully to care for seriously ill patients by developing expertise in various aspects of mental health care. This chapter provides a practical examination of some of these behavioral health aspects that physician assistants can utilize in the care of seriously ill patients, their caregivers, and loved ones.",

The shock plateaued in 2010, enabling analysis of its effects for nearly a decade past its culmination. Adverse impacts of import competition on manufacturing employment, overall employment-population ratios, and income per capita in more trade-exposed U.S. commuting zones are present out to 2019. Over the full study period, greater import competition implies a reduction in the manufacturing employment-population ratio of 1.54 percentage points, which is 55% of the observed change in the value, and the absorption of 86% of this net job loss via a corresponding decrease in the overall employment rate. Reductions in population headcounts, which indicate net out-migration, register only for foreign-born workers and the native-born 25-39 years old, implying that exit from work is a primary means of adjustment to trade-induced contractions in labor demand. More negatively affected regions see\r\nmodest increases in the uptake of government transfers, but these transfers primarily take the form of Social Security and Medicare benefits. Adverse outcomes are more acute in regions that initially had fewer college-educated workers and were more industrially specialized. Impacts are qualitatively - but not quantitatively - similar to those caused by the decline of employment in coal production since the 1980s, indicating that the China trade shock holds lessons for other episodes of localized job loss. Import competition from China induced changes in income per capita across local labor markets that are much larger than the spatial heterogeneity of income effects predicted by standard quantitative trade models. Even using higher-end estimates of the consumer benefits of rising trade with China, a substantial fraction of commuting zones appears to have suffered absolute declines in average real incomes.",

        "document": "Title: Trade and inequality in Europe and the US\nAbstract: Many economies in Western Europe have experienced a sizeable increase in income inequality since the 1980s, and inequality has grown even more rapidly in the United States. Whereas educated workers in skilled occupations benefited from rising salaries, wages have stagnated for many less educated workers in unskilled occupations. The rising inequality in advanced economies coincided with a period of globalisation that was characterised by rapid growth in international merchandise trade.\r\nBasic economic models predict that trade could contribute to greater inequality in skill-abundant advanced economies, as globalisation leads such countries to specialise in skill-intensive industrial sectors, which raises labour demand for skilled workers but reduces demand for unskilled ones. Yet despite this theoretical link between trade and inequality, empirical analyses long concluded that increased trade was not a major cause of increasing inequality in advanced economies. However, this perspective on trade and inequality has evolved during the decade of the 2010s, as a growing body of empirical research found sizeable impacts of trade shocks on labour markets and inequality. During the same period, international trade has become a more contentious subject in political debate, and a many-decades-old trend towards greater trade liberalisation has been broken by new tariffs that resulted in a \u2018trade war\u2019 between the US and China.",

This is the first comparison of a great variety of explanatory factors for recorded offending measured in three different geographic areas and different generations. Several common explanatory factors were found in the three projects, and they seem to be generalizable across time and context. Common explanatory factors for offending included individual factors such as high impulsivity, attention deficit, and low school achievement. Childrearing explanatory factors included poor supervision, physical discipline and parental conflict. Socioeconomic explanatory factors included low family income and divorced parents. Parental imprisonment was also a common risk factor among the three studies. Replicable childhood predictors of youth offending should be targeted in prevention.",

Preventive clinical ethics support aims to identify and address moral problems in patient care at an early stage of their development. This study investigates the occurrence, risk factors, early indicators, decision parameters, consequences and preventive measures of moral problems. Method Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with 20 interprofessional healthcare professionals from 2 university hospitals in Basel, Switzerland. A Likert scale questionnaire was completed by the interviewees and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results Healthcare professionals are frequently exposed to a variety of moral problems, such as end-of-life decisions, resource allocation and assessing the patient's will or decisional capacity. Thirty-four different risk factors for moral problems are identified, e.g. patient vulnerability, divergent values or world views, inadequate resources or poor ethical climate. Twenty-one early indicators are recognised such as disagreement between healthcare professionals, patients and relatives, emotional disturbances, gut feeling or conflict of conscience. A variety of preventive measures are suggested and presented in a preventive clinical ethics support process model. The most helpful measures are early ethical conversations with colleagues, early team-internal ethical case discussions and an ethics-trained contact person on the ward. Ethics training, kerbside consultations, proactive ethics consultations, ethics screening and rounds are also considered helpful. Conclusions Clinical ethics support services should not only offer reactive and complex, but also proactive and low-threshold support for healthcare professionals, patients and relatives.",

We propose a theory in which the positive interaction between firm entry, competition and factor supply can give rise to multiple steady-states. We show that when firm heterogeneity is large, even small temporary shocks can trigger firm exit and make the economy spiral in a competition-driven poverty trap. Calibrating our model to incorporate the well-documented trends in increasing firm heterogeneity we find that, relative to 2007, an economy with the 1985 level of firm heterogeneity is 5 to 9 times less likely to experience a very persistent recession. We use our framework to study the 2008-09 recession and show that the model can rationalize the persistent deviation of output and most macroeconomic aggregates from trend, including the behavior of net entry, markups and the labor share. Post-crisis cross-industry data corroborates our proposed mechanism. Firm subsidies can be powerful in preventing quasi-permanent recessions and can lead to a 21% increase in welfare.",

It is, however, likely that common mechanisms contribute to the development of CVD and NAFLD, with lifestyle factors such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle with poor nutrition habits and physical inactivity being major candidates. These behavioral factors, on a predisposing genetic background, trigger changes in gut microbiota, inflammation, dyslipidemia and oxidative stress, leading to metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity as well as atherosclerosis. Treatment options to counteract both the progression and development of CVD and NAFLD include lifestyle interventions, optimal medical therapy of comorbid conditions and, as final possibility, bariatric surgery. As no causal pharmacotherapy of NAFLD is available, further research is urgently needed to address the unmet need of a growing population with NAFLD and CVD.",

        "document": "Title: Childhood loneliness as a specific risk factor for adult psychiatric disorders\nAbstract: Background\r\nLoneliness is a major risk factor for both psychological disturbance and poor health outcomes in adults. This study aimed to assess whether childhood loneliness is associated with a long-term disruption in mental health that extends into adulthood.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThis study is based on the longitudinal, community-representative Great Smoky Mountains Study of 1420 participants. Participants were assessed with the structured Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment interview up to eight times in childhood (ages 9\u201316; 6674 observations; 1993\u20132000) for childhood loneliness, associated psychiatric comorbidities and childhood adversities. Participants were followed up four times in adulthood (ages 19, 21, 25, and 30; 4556 observations of 1334 participants; 1999\u20132015) with the structured Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment Interview for psychiatric anxiety, depression, and substance use outcomes.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nBoth self and parent-reported childhood loneliness were associated with adult self-reported anxiety and depressive outcomes. The associations remained significant when childhood adversities and psychiatric comorbidities were accounted for. There was no evidence for an association of childhood loneliness with adult substance use disorders. More associations were found between childhood loneliness and adult psychiatric symptoms than with adult diagnostic status.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nChildhood loneliness is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders in young adults, suggesting that loneliness \u2013 even in childhood \u2013 might have long-term costs in terms of mental health. This study underscores the importance of intervening early to prevent loneliness and its sequelae over time.",

HH compliance in companion animal clinics has been reported to be poor. The present study compared an online application with the WHO evaluation form to assess the WHO five moments of HH in a Swiss companion animal clinic. In 202 hand swabs from 87 staff members, total viable count (TVC) before and after patient contact was evaluated and the swabs were tested for selected antimicrobial resistant microorganisms of public health importance. HH compliance (95% confidence interval) was 36.6% (33.8\u201339.5%) and was similar when assessed with the two evaluation tools. HH differed between hospital areas (p = 0.0035) and HH indications (p < 0.0001). Gloves were worn in 22.0% (18.0\u201326.6%) of HH observations and were indicated in 37.2% (27.3\u201348.3%) of these observations. Mean TVC before patient contact was lower (0.52 log CFU/cm2) than after patient contact (1.02 log CFU/cm2) but was similar before patient contact on gloved and ungloved hands. Three hand swabs (1.5% (0.4\u20134.3%)) were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Gloving should not be regarded as a substitute for HH. Overall, HH in companion animal medicine should urgently be fostered.",

Although the diagnosis of hypertension is still based on office blood pressure, confirmation with out-of-office blood pressure measurements (ie, ambulatory or home monitoring) is strongly recommended. The definition of hypertension differs throughout various guidelines, but the indications for antihypertensive therapy are relatively similar. Lifestyle adaptation is absolutely key in non-pharmacological treatment. Pharmacologically, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics are the first-line agents, with advice for the use of single-pill combination therapy by most guidelines. As a fourth-line agent, spironolactone should be considered. The rapidly evolving field of device-based therapy, especially renal denervation, will further broaden therapeutic options. Despite being a largely controllable condition, the actual rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension are disappointingly low. Further improvements throughout the process of patient screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up need to be urgently addressed.",

        "document": "Title: Mindfulness predicts less depression, anxiety, and social impairment in emergency care personnel: A longitudinal study\nAbstract: Medical personnel working in emergency rooms (ER) are at increased risk of mental health problems and suicidality. There is increasing evidence that mindfulness-based interventions can improve burnout and other mental health outcomes in health care providers. In contrast, few longitudinal prospective studies have examined protective functions of dispositional mindfulness in this population. The objective of this study was to examine whether mindfulness prospectively predicts anxiety, depression, and social impairment in a sample of emergency care professionals. The authors administered online surveys to ER personnel prior to work in ER, and at 3 and 6 months follow up. Participants were 190 ER personnel (73% residents, 16% medical students, 11% nurses). Linear mixed effects regression was used to model longitudinal 3-month and 6-month follow up of depression, anxiety, and social impairment. Predictors included time-varying contemporaneous work stressors, perceived social support at work and life events, and baseline dispositional mindfulness, demographics, and workplace characteristics. Mindfulness indexed when starting ER work predicted less depression, anxiety, and social impairment 6 months later. Mindfulness remained a strong predictor of mental health outcomes after controlling for time-varying stressful events in emergency care, negative life events, and social support at work. Mindfulness moderated the adverse impact of poor social support at work on depression. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to show that mindfulness prospectively and robustly predicts anxiety, depression, and social impairment. Results support the role of mindfulness as a potential resilience factor in at-risk health care providers.",

We studied how well parents and children agreed when asked to report symptoms of wheeze and investigated whose answers were closer to measurable traits of asthma.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nLuftiBus in the school is a cross-sectional survey of respiratory health among Swiss schoolchildren aged 6\u201317 years. We applied questionnaires to parents and children asking about wheeze and exertional wheeze in the past year. We assessed agreement between parent\u2013child answers with Cohen's kappa (k), and associations of answers from children and parents with fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009s over forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), using quantile regression.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nWe received questionnaires from 3079 children and their parents. Agreement was poor for reported wheeze (k\u2009=\u20090.37) and exertional wheeze (k\u2009=\u20090.36). Median FeNO varied when wheeze was reported by children (19\u2009ppb, interquartile range [IQR]: 9\u201344), parents (22\u2009ppb, IQR: 12\u201346), both (31\u2009ppb, IQR: 16\u201355), or neither (11 ppb, IQR: 7\u201319). Median absolute FEV1/FVC was the same when wheeze was reported by children (84%, IQR: 78\u201389) and by parents (84%, IQR: 78\u201389), lower when reported by both (82%, IQR: 78\u201387), and higher when reported by neither (87%, IQR: 82\u201391). For exertional wheeze findings were similar. Results did not differ by age or sex.\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOur findings suggest that surveying both parents and children and combining their responses can help us to better identify children with measurable asthma traits.",

We hypothesize better visibility of ischemic scars and equal visibility of non-ischemic LGE in LGEshort compared to clinically established LGE (LGEstandard).\r\n\r\nMethods: LGEshort and LGEstandard were retrospectively evaluated in 179 patients (3043 segments) with suspected or known coronary artery disease by four blinded readers (reader A: most experienced - D: least experienced). The amount of ischemic and non-ischemic LGE as well as visibility (4: very good - 1: poor) of ischemic LGE was visually assessed.\r\n\r\nResults: All readers detected more infarcted segments in LGEshort compared to LGEstandard (378 segments reported as infarcted; A:p = 0.5, B:p = 0.8, C,D:p = 0.03). Scar visibility was scored higher in LGEshort by all readers (A,B:p = 0.03; C,D:p = 0.02), especially for subendocardial infarcts (A,B:p = 0.04, C,D:p = 0.02). Less experienced readers detected significantly more infarcted papillary muscles (C:p = 0.02, D:p = 0.03) in a shorter reading time in LGEshort (C:p = 0.04, D:p = 0.02). Non-ischemic LGE was equally visible in both sequences (A:p = 0.9, B:p = 0.8, C,D:p = 0.6).\r\n\r\nConclusions: LGEshort detects more ischemic LGE with improved scar visibility compared to LGEstandard, independent of experience level. The visibility of non-ischemic LGE is equivalent to LGEstandard. Less experienced readers can diagnose ischemic and non-ischemic LGE faster in LGEshort.\r\n\r\nAdvances in knowledge: LGEshort with its maximal operational simplicity can be used for visualization of all types of fibrosis - ischemic and non-ischemic - instead of LGEstandard, independent of experience level.",

        "document": "Title: The paradox of poor representation: How voter\u2013party incongruence curbs affective polarisation\nAbstract: Research on the relationship between ideology and affective polarisation highlights ideological disagreement as a key driver of animosity between partisan groups. By operationalising disagreement on the left\u2013right dimension, however, existing studies often overlook voter\u2013party incongruence as a potential determinant of affective evaluations. How does incongruence on policy issues impact affective evaluations of mainstream political parties and their leaders? We tackle this question by analysing data from the British Election Study collected ahead of the 2019 UK General Election using an instrumental variable approach. Consistent with our expectations, we find that voter\u2013party incongruence has a significant causal impact on affective evaluations. Perceived representational gaps between party and voter drive negative evaluations of the in-party and positive evaluations of the opposition, thus lowering affective polarisation overall. The results offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of ideological conflict in driving affective polarisation.",

Any political decision that implements these principles comes at a cost in terms of loss of lives and of loss of life years that could potentially have been prevented by a different vaccination strategy. This article illustrates these trade-offs using quantitative analysis and shows how this approach can contribute to providing a rational and transparent grounding of political decisions on COVID-19 vaccine allocation.",

Although evidence-based recommendations are lacking, aP is often used to prevent RGT. This systematic review aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of aP in adult and pediatric KTx recipients.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, conference proceedings, and electronic databases for trial registries were searched for eligible studies using search terms relevant to this review (April 21, 2020). The systematic review was carried out following the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Prefered Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nTwelve studies comprising 2370 patients (adult\u00a0=\u00a01415, pediatric\u00a0=\u00a0955) were included, of which three were RCTs. The overall risk for developing RGT was lower in the group with aP compared with the control group (RR 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.49). The antithrombotic drugs used were heparin (7/12), acetylsalicylic acid (2/12), a combination of both (2/12), and dipyridamole (1/12) with a high variability in timing, dosing, and mode of application. Adverse effects were reported rarely, with minor bleeding as the main complication. The non-randomized studies had significant risks of bias in the domains of patient selection, confounder, and measurement of outcomes.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on pooled analysis, aP seems to reduce the risk of RGT in KTx. However, the reliability of these results is limited, as the quality of the available studies is poor and information on adverse effects associated with aP is scarce. Additional high-quality research is urgently needed to provide sufficient data supporting the use of aP in KTx.",

        "document": "Title: Long-term outcome of urea cycle disorders: Report from a nationwide study in Japan\nAbstract: Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are inherited metabolic disorders with impaired nitrogen detoxification caused by defects in urea cycle enzymes. They often manifest with hyperammonemic attacks resulting in significant morbidity or death. We performed a nationwide questionnaire-based study between January 2000 and March 2018 to document all UCDs in Japan, including diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes. A total of 229 patients with UCDs were enrolled in this study: 73 males and 53 females with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD), 33 patients with carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1 deficiency, 48 with argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency, 14 with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, and 8 with arginase deficiency. Survival rates at 20\u2009years of age of male and female patients with late-onset OTCD were 100% and 97.7%, respectively. Blood ammonia levels and time of onset had a significant impact on the neurodevelopmental outcome (P\u2009<\u2009.001 and P = .028, respectively). Hemodialysis and liver transplantation did not prevent poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. While treatment including medication, hemodialysis, and liver transplantation may aid in decreasing blood ammonia and/or preventing severe hyperammonemia, a blood ammonia level \u2265\u2009360 \u03bcmol/L was found to be a significant indicator for a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. In conclusion, although current therapy for UCDs has advanced and helped saving lives, patients with blood ammonia levels \u2265\u2009360 \u03bcmol/L at onset often have impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes.

As an important step towards the clinical implementation of CEPs as a diagnostic tool, we evaluated the feasibility and reliability of CEPs in response to rapid cooling of the skin (-300\u00a0\u00b0C/s) and different stimulation sites in young and elderly healthy individuals. Time-locked electroencephalographic responses were recorded from at vertex in fifteen young (20-40\u00a0years) and sixteen elderly (50-70\u00a0years), individuals in response to 15 rapid cold stimuli (-300\u00a0\u00b0C/s) applied to the skin of the hand dorsum, palm, and foot dorsum. High CEP proportions were shown for young individuals at all sites (hand dorsum/palm: 100% and foot: 79%) and elderly individuals after stimulation of the hand dorsum (81%) and palm (63%), but not the foot (44%). Depending on the age group and stimulation site, test-retest reliability was \"poor\" to \"substantial\" for N2P2 amplitudes and N2 latencies. Rapid cooling of the skin enables the recording of reliable CEPs in young individuals. In elderly individuals, CEP recordings were only robust after stimulation of the hand, but particularly challenging after stimulation of the foot. Further improvements in stimulation paradigms are warranted to introduce CEPs for clinical diagnostics.",

We have seen that many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) still lack access to vaccines, and it seems little progress has been made in the last few months and year. This article discusses whether the current strategies, most notably, vaccine donations by the international community and the COVID-19 global access facility COVAX, offer meaningful solutions to tackle the problem. At the centre of our analysis, we compare the concepts of \u201cdonations\u201d and \u201ccharity\u201d with \u201cvaccine equity\u201d and the \u201cempowerment\u201d of poorer countries.

However, whether this treatment improves clinical outcome is unclear. We investigated whether ultra-early, short-term treatment with tranexamic acid improves clinical outcome at 6 months.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nIn this multicentre prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label trial with masked outcome assessment, adult patients with spontaneous CT-proven subarachnoid haemorrhage in eight treatment centres and 16 referring hospitals in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to treatment with tranexamic acid in addition to care as usual (tranexamic acid group) or care as usual only (control group). Tranexamic acid was started immediately after diagnosis in the presenting hospital (1 g bolus, followed by continuous infusion of 1 g every 8 h, terminated immediately before aneurysm treatment, or 24 h after start of the medication, whichever came first). The primary endpoint was clinical outcome at 6 months, assessed by the modified Rankin Scale, dichotomised into a good (0-3) or poor (4-6) clinical outcome. Both primary and safety analyses were according to intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02684812.\r\n\r\nFINDINGS\r\n\r\nBetween July 24, 2013, and July 29, 2019, we enrolled 955 patients; 480 patients were randomly assigned to tranexamic acid and 475 patients to the control group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, good clinical outcome was observed in 287 (60%) of 475 patients in the tranexamic acid group, and 300 (64%) of 470 patients in the control group (treatment centre adjusted odds ratio 0\u00b786, 95% CI 0\u00b766-1\u00b712). Rebleeding after randomisation and before aneurysm treatment occurred in 49 (10%) patients in the tranexamic acid and in 66 (14%) patients in the control group (odds ratio 0\u00b771, 95% CI 0\u00b748-1\u00b704). Other serious adverse events were comparable between groups.\r\n\r\nINTERPRETATION\r\n\r\nIn patients with CT-proven subarachnoid haemorrhage, presumably caused by a ruptured aneurysm, ultra-early, short-term tranexamic acid treatment did not improve clinical outcome at 6 months, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale.\r\n\r\nFUNDING\r\n\r\nFonds NutsOhra.",

Evidence suggests that the co-occurrence of personality pathology is associated with longer time to MDD remission. Interpersonal pathoplasticity, the mutually influencing nonetiological relationship between psychopathology and interpersonal traits, offers an avenue for examining specific personality vulnerabilities that may be associated with depressive course.\r\n\r\nMethod: This study examined 312 participants with and without a co-occurring personality disorder diagnosis who met criteria for a current MDD episode at baseline and who were followed for 10 years in the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study.\r\n\r\nResults: Latent profile analysis (LPA) identified 6 interpersonal groups (extraverted, dominant, arrogant, cold, submissive, and unassuming), and circular statistical profile analysis confirmed group interpersonal distinctiveness. No significant differences between groups were found in comorbid Axis I disorders or baseline MDD severity. Chronicity and functioning analyses found significantly greater chronicity and poorer functioning in individuals with a submissive interpersonal style over 10 years.\r\n\r\nConclusions: These findings support the relevance of interpersonal pathoplasticity in depressive course and that this heterogeneity has clinical significance. This study is the first to use LPA and circular profiles to examine interpersonal heterogeneity within a diagnostic group. The implications of these findings for therapeutic intervention, interpersonal functioning, and psychopathological course are discussed.",

The authors demonstrate poor CFA fit for several widely used personality measures with documented evidence of criterion-related validity but also show that some measures perform well from an exploratory factor analytic perspective. In light of these results, the authors suggest that the failure of these measures to fit CFA models is because of the inherent complexity of personality, issues related to its measurement, and issues related to the application and interpretation of CFA models. This leads to three recommendations for researchers interested in the structure and assessment of personality traits: (a) utilize and report on a range of factor analytic methods, (b) avoid global evaluations regarding the internal validity of multiscale personality measures based on model fit according to conventional CFA cutoffs, and (c) consider the substantive and practical implications of model modifications designed to improve fit.",

We aimed at identifying age-related molecular differences that would justify and guide distinct treatment decisions in elderly glioblastoma patients. The combined DNA methylome (450\u00a0k) of four IDH wild-type glioblastoma datasets, comprising two clinical trial cohorts, was interrogated for differences based on the patients' age, DNA methylation (DNAm) age acceleration (DNAm age \"Horvath-clock\" minus patient age), DNA methylation-based tumor classification (Heidelberg), entropy, and functional methylation of DNA damage response (DDR) genes. Age dependent methylation included 19 CpGs (p-value\u2009\u2264\u20090.1, Bonferroni corrected), comprising a CpG located in the ELOVL2 gene that is part of a 13-gene forensic age predictor. Most of the age related CpGs (n\u2009=\u200916) were also associated with age acceleration that itself was associated with a large number of CpGs (n\u2009=\u200950,551). Over 70% age acceleration-associated CpGs (n\u2009=\u200936,348) overlapped with those associated with the DNA methylation based tumor classification (n\u2009=\u2009170,759). Gene set enrichment analysis identified associated pathways, providing insights into the biology of DNAm age acceleration and respective commonalities with glioblastoma classification. Functional methylation of several DDR genes, defined as correlation of methylation with gene expression (r\u2009\u2264\u2009-0.3), was associated with age acceleration (n\u2009=\u20098), tumor classification (n\u2009=\u200912), or both (n\u2009=\u20094), the latter including MGMT. DNAm age acceleration was significantly associated with better outcome in both clinical trial cohorts, whereof one comprised only elderly patients. Multivariate analysis included treatment (RT, RT/TMZ\u2192TMZ; TMZ, RT), MGMT promoter methylation status, and interaction with treatment. In conclusion, DNA methylation features of age acceleration are an integrative part of the methylation-based tumor classification (RTK I, RTK II, MES), while patient age seems hardly reflected in the glioblastoma DNA methylome. We found no molecular evidence justifying other treatments in elderly patients, not owing to frailty or co-morbidities.",

This study aimed to determine whether health-related quality of life (HRQoL) can be maintained during progression-free time, and factors associated with HRQoL deterioration in this period.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWe included longitudinal HRQoL data from previously published clinical trials in glioma. The percentage of patients with stable HRQoL until progression was determined per scale and at the individual patient level (i.e. considering all scales simultaneously). We assessed time to a clinically relevant deterioration in HRQoL, expressed in deterioration-free survival and time-to-deterioration (the first including progression as an event). We also determined the association between sociodemographic and clinical factors and HRQoL deterioration in the progression-free period.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\n5539 patients with at least baseline HRQoL scores had a median time from randomization to progression of 7.6 months. Between 9%-29% of the patients deteriorated before disease progression on the evaluated HRQoL scales. When considering all scales simultaneously, 47% of patients deteriorated on \u22651 scale. Median deterioration-free survival period ranged between 3.8-5.4 months, and median time-to-deterioration between 8.2-11.9 months. For most scales, only poor performance status was independently associated with clinically relevant HRQoL deterioration in the progression-free period.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nHRQoL was maintained in only 53% of patients in their progression-free period, and treatment was not independently associated with this deterioration in HRQoL. Routine monitoring of the patients' functioning and well-being during the entire disease course is therefore important, so that interventions can be initiated when problems are signalled.",

This provided a unique situation to investigate the effect of training limitations on the training patterns, training adaptive strategies and mental health of BoFAs.\r\n\r\nObjectives: The primary aim of this study was to investigate differences in the training patterns and the mental health of BoFA before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown. The secondary aim was to assess whether BoFA who exhibited features of muscle dysmorphia were affected differently from the group that did not.\r\n\r\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 85 BoFAs by means of an online questionnaire asking about sports activity, intensity, subjective physical performance, and economic status, including primary or secondary occupations before (from memory) and during lockdown, current physical health problems and financial fears, symptoms of depression, sleep disorders, anxiety (trait and state), muscle dysmorphia, coping mechanisms and actions during the first lockdown in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nResults: Training patterns and mental health of BoFA were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown. During lockdown, the physical activity on the BoFA dropped significantly from 2.3 \u00b1 0.8 h per day to 1.6 \u00b1 0.9 h per day (p < 0.001), the subjective training intensity decreased significantly from 85.7 \u00b1 13.2% to 58.3 \u00b1 28.3% (p < 0.001) and the subjective performance declined significantly from 83.4 \u00b1 14.3% to 58.2 \u00b1 27.8% (p < 0.001) of maximal performance. In comparison to those without risk for body dysmorphia, participants at risk rated their maximal performance significantly lower and scored significantly higher for depression, sleep disorders and anxiety.\r\n\r\nConclusion: This study showed the significant changes on the training patterns of BoFA before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown and poor mental health scores of BoFA during the lockdown itself, with those at risk of muscle dysmorphia scoring statistically worse regarding mental health than those with no risk of muscle dysmorphia. To better understand the particularities of BoFA, further investigation is needed to understand their psychology and in particular the effect of training restrictions on it.",

        "document": "Title: Rise of the machines: Delegating decisions to autonomous AI\nAbstract: Delegation is an important part of organizational success and can be used to overcome personal shortcomings and draw upon the expertise and abilities of others. However, delegation comes with risks and uncertainties, as it entails a transfer of power and loss of control. Indeed, research has documented that people tend to under-delegate to other humans, often leading to poor decisions and ultimately negative economic consequences. Today, however, people are faced with a new delegation choice: Artificial Intelligence (AI). Fueled by Big Data, AI is rapidly becoming more intelligent and frequently outperforming human forecasters and decision-makers. Given this evolution of computational autonomy, researchers need to revisit the hows and whys of decision delegation and clarify not only whether people are willing to cede control to AI agents but also whether AI can reduce the under-delegation that is especially pronounced when people are faced with decisions that spur a high desire for control. By linking research on decision delegation, social risk, and control premium to the emerging field of trust in AI, we propose and find that people prefer to delegate decisions to AI as compared to human agents, especially when decisions entail losses (Studies 1\u20133). Results further illuminate the underlying psychological process involved (Study 1 and 2) and show that process transparency increases delegation to humans but not to AI (Study 3). These findings have important implications for research on trust in AI and the applicability of autonomous AI systems for managers and decision makers.",

We have now addressed this question experimentally by creating heterozygous knock-in mice that express the ribosomal ambiguity mutation RPS9 D95N, resulting in genome-wide error-prone translation. Here, we show that Rps9 D95N knock-in mice exhibit reduced life span and a premature onset of numerous aging-related phenotypes, such as reduced weight, chest deformation, hunchback posture, poor fur condition, and urinary syndrome, together with lymphopenia, increased levels of reactive oxygen species-inflicted damage, accelerated age-related changes in DNA methylation, and telomere attrition.

Poor metabolic control and low treatment adherence remain major issues for many pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. Important risk factors for both include psychosocial variables such as stress. To date, stress in type 1 diabetes patients and their parents has been investigated at an individual level. The present study tested the hypothesis that patients\u2019, mothers\u2019, and fathers\u2019 perceived stress is positively related to each other and therefore is a factor common to the family. This factor was then hypothesized to be related to patients\u2019 poorer treatment adherence behavior and metabolic control. Research Design and Methods. This cross-sectional study at the University Children\u2019s Hospital Zurich included 190 type 1 diabetes patients (age: 7\u201318 years; illness duration: \u22651 year) and their families. The Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure the self-reported stress of patients, mothers, and fathers. Patients\u2019 treatment adherence was rated by their endocrinologists. HbA1c served as indicator of metabolic control. A structural equation model (SEM) was conducted for analysis. Results. The SEM showed adequate model fit. Patients\u2019 (\u03b2 = .567, p \u2264 .001), mother\u2019s (\u03b2 = .621, p \u2264 .001), and father\u2019s (\u03b2 = .585, p \u2264 .001) perceived stress loaded all on a single factor, perceived family stress. This factor was significantly associated with treatment adherence (\u03b2 = -.384, p \u2264 .001) and with HbA1c (\u03b2 = .210, p = .012) of patients. Conclusions. Results confirmed perceived family stress to be a common family construct. Because perceived family stress might have a negative impact on patients\u2019 treatment adherence and HbA1c, subjective stress appraisals of patients and both parents should be considered when counseling children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.",

This study examined the course of sleep disturbance and associated factors in patients with ACS who were followed for one year.\r\nMethods: Study participants were 180 patients (mean age 59.6 years, 81.7% men) with ACS admitted to a tertiary hospital to undergo acute coronary intervention. Sleep disturbance was interviewer-assessed at admission (n = 180), at 3 months (n = 146), and at 12 months (n = 101) using the Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS)-4, with a total of 414 assessments over one year. Random linear mixed regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between sociodemographic factors, cardiac diseases severity, perceived distress during ACS, comorbidities, medication, health behaviors, and sleep disturbance over time.\r\nResults: At admission, 3 months, and 12 months, 56.7%, 49.3%, and 49.5% of patients, respectively, scored above the mean value for sleep disturbance in the general population (JSS-4 score \u22655). There was a significant decrease in continuous JSS-4 scores over time [estimate (SE) = -0.211 (0.074), p = 0.005]. Female sex [0.526 (0.206), p = 0.012], greater fear of dying [0.074 (0.026), p = 0.004], helplessness during ACS [0.062 (0.029), p = 0.034], and a history of depression [0.422 (0.171), p = 0.015] were independently associated with higher JSS-4 scores over time.\r\nConclusion: Despite a decrease from admission to 3 months, sleep disturbance is prevalent in the first year after ACS. Female sex, depression history, and distress during ACS identify patients at increased risk of developing persistent sleep disturbance and may inform interventions to prevent sleep disturbance.",

As current standard-of-care demonstrates limited success, the development of new efficacious GBM therapeutics is urgently needed. Major challenges in advancing GBM chemotherapy include poor bioavailability, lack of tumor selectivity leading to undesired side effects, poor permeability across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), and extensive intratumoral heterogeneity. Methods: We have previously identified a small, soluble peptide (BTP-7) that is able to cross the BBB and target the human GBM extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we covalently attached BTP-7 to an insoluble anti-cancer drug, camptothecin (CPT). Results: We demonstrate that conjugation of BTP-7 to CPT improves drug solubility in aqueous solution, retains drug efficacy against patient-derived GBM stem cells (GSC), enhances BBB permeability, and enables therapeutic targeting to intracranial GBM, leading to higher toxicity in GBM cells compared to normal brain tissues, and ultimately prolongs survival in mice bearing intracranial patient-derived GBM xenograft. Conclusion: BTP-7 is a new modality that opens the door to possibilities for GBM-targeted therapeutic approaches.\r\nKeywords: glioblastoma; peptide; brevican; drug targeting; precision medicine; chemotherapy; blood\u2013brain barrier",

Muscle perfusion (tHb) and oxygenation (SmO2) were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) based oximetry in three back muscles during the BSME. Reliability of tHb and SmO2 was assessed in a separate sample. BSME holding time and SmO2 were compared between patients (n = 45) and controls (n = 45) and factors associated with BSME holding time were assessed using multiple linear regression. Reliability for SmO2 was excellent (ICC = 0.87-0.99). THb showed poor to moderate reliability and was not further used. Groups differed for BSME holding time (P = 0.03), pain intensity (P \u2264 0.0005) and subcutaneous tissue thickness (P = 0.01) but not for NIRS measures. Physical activity and BMI were associated with BSME holding times. Insufficient muscle oxygenation does not seem to be a major factor contributing to CNSLBP. Future investigation should evaluate other determinants of BSME holding times, such as motivation and recruitment of auxiliary muscles.",

This is due to a poor dietary iron density and low iron absorption resulting from the high inhibitory phytic acid content in cereal and millet-based diets. Here, we report that a naturally occurring low phytic acid finger millet accession (571 mg 100 g-1), stable across three growing seasons with normal iron content (3.6 mg 100 g-1), increases iron absorption by 3-folds in normal Indian women. The accessions differing in grain phytic acid content, GE 2358 (low), and GE1004 (high) were selected from a core collection of 623 accessions. Whole genome re-sequencing of the accessions revealed significant single nucleotide variations segregating them into distinct clades. A non-synonymous mutation in the EcABCC phytic acid transporter gene between high and low accessions could affect gene function and result in phytic acid differences. The highly sensitive dual stable-isotope erythrocyte incorporation method was adopted to assess the fractional iron absorption. The low phytic acid accession resulted in a significantly higher iron absorption compared with the high phytic acid accession (3.7 vs. 1.3%, p < 0.05). The low phytic acid accession could be effective in preventing iron deficiency in regions where finger millet is habitually eaten. With its low water requirement, finger millet leaves low environmental footprints and hence would be an excellent sustainable strategy to mitigate iron deficiency.\r\n\r\nKeywords: bioavailability; finger millet; grain phytic acid; iron deficiency anemia (IDA); stable isotope.",

        "document": "Title: The pursuit of simplicity: Can simplifying eligibility criteria improve social pension targeting?\nAbstract: Governments in developing countries struggle to reach intended beneficiaries when targeting social transfers towards vulnerable populations. Rates of eligible individuals not receiving social transfers and ineligible individuals receiving them tend to be high, constraining the effectiveness of such anti-poverty programs. While interventions to incentivize or monitor local agents in charge of selecting beneficiaries are typically expensive, an important complementary and cost-effective approach could be to reform eligibility criteria to facilitate the selection of beneficiaries. Whether reforms should focus on reducing the number of rules, or selecting criteria which are easy to verify, or do both remains an unanswered question. We address this knowledge gap based on India\u2019s social pension scheme for elderly poor. We find that making eligibility criteria easier to verify has the potential to achieve a substantial improvement in the targeting performance through a reduction in the exclusion error. Those who meet the relevant criteria have a much higher chance of actually becoming beneficiaries. Since eligibility criteria can be changed at low cost, this suggests a viable route for reform in many developing countries. However, a major caveat remains that criteria must sufficiently well reflect actual poverty if the more accurate selection of beneficiaries according to formal criteria shall also translate into actual poverty reduction.",

Group differences were tested using independent t-tests and \u03c7$^{2}$-tests. Equivalence testing was used to investigate similarities between the groups.\r\nRESULTS: Mild (ie, 70 \u2264 IQ\u00a0<\u00a085) and severe intellectual impairments (ie, IQ\u00a0<\u00a070) occurred in 17.4% and 4.5% of children with CHD compared with 22.1% and 5.5% in children VPT, respectively. Motor and behavioral functions were impaired in 57.0% and 15.3% of children with CHD compared with 37.8% and 11.5% of children born VPT, respectively. Children with CHD had poorer global motor abilities (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.26) and poorer dynamic balance (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.62) than children born VPT, and children born VPT had poorer fine motor abilities than children with CHD (d\u00a0=\u00a00.34; all P\u00a0<\u00a0.023). Peer problems were statistically similar between the groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.020). Therapies were less frequent in children with CHD compared with children born VPT (23.4% vs 40.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Children with CHD undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and children born VPT share an overall risk for neurodevelopmental impairments that manifest in different domains. Despite this, children with CHD receive fewer therapies, indicating a lack of awareness of the neurodevelopmental burden these children face.",

Such temporal discounting may feed into rising global inequality, yet it is unclear whether it is a function of choice preferences or norms, or rather the absence of sufficient resources for immediate needs. It is also not clear whether these reflect true differences in choice patterns between income groups. We tested temporal discounting and five intertemporal choice anomalies using local currencies and value standards in 61 countries (N\u2009=\u200913,629). Across a diverse sample, we found consistent, robust rates of choice anomalies. Lower-income groups were not significantly different, but economic inequality and broader financial circumstances were clearly correlated with population choice patterns.",

Due to a very poor prognosis and limited treatment options, the need to identify new prognostic markers represents a great clinical challenge. The prognostic role of metabolic information derived from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with $^{18}$F-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose ($^{18}$F-FDG) has been investigated in different MPM settings, however with no definitive consensus. In this comprehensive review, the prognostic value of FDG-PET imaging exclusively performed at staging in MPM patients was evaluated, conducting a literature search on PubMed/MEDLINE from 2010 to 2020. From the 19 selected studies, despite heterogeneity in several aspects, staging FDG-PET imaging emerges as a valuable prognostic biomarker, with higher tumor uptake predictive of worse prognosis, and with volumetric metabolic parameters like Metabolic Tumor Volume, (MTV) and Total Lesion Glycolisis (TLG) performing better than SUVmax. However, PET uptake parameters were not always confirmed as independent prognostic factors, especially in patients previously treated with pleurodesis and with a non-epithelioid histotype. Future prospective studies in larger and clinically homogeneous populations, and using more standardized methods of PET images analysis, are needed to further validate the value of staging FDG-PET in the prognostic MPM stratification, with a potential impact on better patient-tailored treatment planning, in the perspective of personalized medicine.",

Well-being of 200 children (between 7 and 18\u00a0years of age; 73 typically developing, 46 born very preterm, 73 with complex congenital heart disease) and 175 of their parents was assessed prior to and during the first (April\u2013May 2020), second (October\u2013November 2020), third (April\u2013May 2021), and fourth wave (October\u2013November 2021) of the pandemic with standardized questionnaires. Linear mixed models were used to investigate longitudinal changes in child and parent well-being compared to before the pandemic. Social and COVID-19-specific determinants were investigated as predictors of impaired well-being. To illustrate clinical relevance, the proportion of children and parents scoring\u2009>\u20091 SD below normative mean/median was reported. Compared to before the pandemic, child proxy-reported well-being was lower during the first but not the second, third, and fourth waves. Child self-reported well-being was not lower during the pandemic compared to before. Parent well-being dropped during the first wave and remained low throughout the subsequent waves. Proxy-reported child and self-reported parent well-being was lower in families with sparse social support and poor family functioning. Parents of typically developing children reported lower well-being than parents of children born very preterm or with a complex congenital heart disease. In November 2021, 20% of children (both self- and proxy-report) and 24% of parents scored below the normal range compared to 11% (child self-report), 10% (child proxy-report), and 16% (parent self-report), respectively, before the pandemic. The pandemic continues to impact the well-being of parents of school-aged children with and without complex medical histories more than 1 year after its outbreak. Children\u2019s well-being was specifically affected during the first wave of the pandemic and has recovered thereafter. Families with sparse social support and poor family functioning are particularly at risk for compromised well-being and support should be provided to them.",

Importantly, these patients were not identified as a specific subgroup in the landmark melanoma trials involving ipilimumab and the anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab. There is therefore an absence of prospective clinical trial evidence regarding the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) in this population. Acral melanoma has lower tumor mutation burden (TMB) than other cutaneous sites, and primary site is associated with differences in TMB. However the impact of this on the effectiveness of immune CPIs is unknown. We examined the efficacy of CPIs in acral melanoma, including by primary site.MethodsPatients with unresectable stage III/IV acral melanoma treated with CPI (anti-PD-1 and/or ipilimumab) were studied. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were conducted. Primary outcome was objective response rate (ORR); secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).ResultsIn total, 325 patients were included: 234 (72%) plantar, 69 (21%) subungual and 22 (7%) palmar primary sites. First CPI included: 184 (57%) anti-PD-1, 59 (18%) anti-PD-1/ipilimumab combination and 82 (25%) ipilimumab. ORR was significantly higher with initial anti-PD-1/ipilimumab compared with anti-PD-1 (43% vs 26%, HR 2.14, p=0.0004) and significantly lower with ipilimumab (15% vs 26%, HR 0.49, p=0.0016). Landmark PFS at 1 year was highest for anti-PD-1/ipilimumab at 34% (95% CI 24% to 49%), compared with 26% (95% CI 20% to 33%) with anti-PD-1 and 10% (95% CI 5% to 19%) with ipilimumab. Despite a trend for increased PFS, anti-PD-1/ipilimumab combination did not significantly improve PFS (HR 0.85, p=0.35) or OS over anti-PD-1 (HR 1.30, p=0.16), potentially due to subsequent therapies and high rates of acquired resistance. No outcome differences were found between primary sites.ConclusionWhile the ORR to anti-PD-1/ipilimumab was significantly higher than anti-PD-1 and PFS numerically higher, in this retrospective cohort this benefit did not translate to improved OS. Future trials should specifically include patients with acral melanoma, to help determine the optimal management of this important melanoma subtype.",

However, poor numeracy and severe numerical learning problems are very common in our society and imply serious obstacles in daily lives, school, or professional success. It is time to gain advantages from obtained numeracy research and neuroscientific knowledge of the recent years for affected people. First, early symbolic numerical skills have been proven being crucial for later mathematical skills and enable us to identify children at risk for mathematical learning disorders already in preschool. Second, an early support of these preschool children has the potential to enable them to catch up to the mathematical levels of their peers, facilitates school entry, school development, and prevents the development of severe math learning problems. Third, general evidence-based recommendations are given that make an intervention particularly effective for people with poor numeracy. Moreover, we highlight the neuronal changes that go along with successful numerical training. Finally, insights are provided into recent approaches to stimulate the human brain by noninvasive methods using low electrical currents open new venues to facilitate numerical learning. Although it is still unclear which factors best predict individual learning success through intervention. However, there is evidence that the earlier you intervene the better and that children with more severe numerical difficulties are rather dependent on intense and individualized interventions.",

All randomized patients with PPI use \u2264 30 days before initiating study treatment were included in the PPI-use subgroup.

Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival analyses provided insufficient evidence of a meaningful association between PPI use and efficacy outcomes with nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab, nivolumab, or ipilimumab therapy. In five of the six ICI treatment arms, 95% confidence intervals for odds ratios or hazard ratios traversed 1.

Mast cells (MCs), long-lived tissue-resident cells that are particularly abundant in human skin where they regulate both innate and adaptive immunity, are associated with melanoma stroma (MAMCs). Thus, MAMCs could impact melanoma development, progression, and metastasis by secreting proteases, pro-angiogenic factors, and both pro-inflammatory and immuno-inhibitory mediators. To interrogate the as-yet poorly characterized role of human MAMCs, we have purified MCs from melanoma skin biopsies and performed RNA-seq analysis. Here, we demonstrate that MAMCs display a unique transcriptome signature defined by the downregulation of the Fc\u03b5RI signaling pathway, a distinct expression pattern of proteases and pro-angiogenic factors, and a profound upregulation of complement component C3. Furthermore, in melanoma tissue, we observe a significantly increased number of C3$^{+}$ MCs in stage IV melanoma. Moreover, in patients, C3 expression significantly correlates with the MC-specific marker TPSAB1, and the high expression of both markers is linked with poorer melanoma survival. In vitro, we show that melanoma cell supernatants and tumor microenvironment (TME) mediators such as TGF-\u03b2, IL-33, and IL-1\u03b2 induce some of the changes found in MAMCs and significantly modulate C3 expression and activity in MCs. Taken together, these data suggest that melanoma-secreted cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 contribute to the melanoma microenvironment by upregulating C3 expression in MAMCs, thus inducing an MC phenotype switch that negatively impacts melanoma prognosis.",

Methods A survey focused on clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures, treatments, cats\u2019 QoL and disease progression was distributed worldwide to owners of cats with HS. The owner\u2019s perception of the cats\u2019 QoL before and after or during treatment was defined using a score ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Improvement following treatment (IFT) was quantified using a score ranging from 1 (absent) to 5 (obvious). Different treatment groups, including at least five cases, were compared. Results A total of 127 cats were included from at least 11 different countries. Among these, 120 (95%) were diabetic and 7 (5%) were not. Out of 120 diabetic cats, 55 (46%) were treated with insulin as a single treatment (INS). Other treatments were not mentioned to owners in 35/120 (29%) cases. The median QoL score at diagnosis was 2 (range 1\u20135) and improved after treatment in all groups. Cabergoline (4; range 1\u20135), radiotherapy (4; range 2\u20135) and hypophysectomy (5; range 4\u20135) showed better median IFT scores compared with INS (3; range 1\u20135) ( P\u2009=\u20090.046, P <0.002 and P <0.0001, respectively). Hypophysectomy IFT proved superior to cabergoline ( P\u2009=\u20090.047) and was equal to radiotherapy IFT ( P\u2009=\u20090.32). No difference was found between cabergoline and radiotherapy IFT ( P\u2009=\u20090.99). The median survival time (MST) was 24 months (range 0\u201375 months). Cats treated with INS showed shorter MST (22 months; range 0\u201369 months) compared with cats treated with causal treatments combined (36 months; range 3\u201375 months) ( P\u2009=\u20090.04). Conclusions and relevance Not all cats with HS will have diabetes mellitus. Causal treatments seem associated with the greatest improvements in perceived cats\u2019 QoL and survival; such treatments should therefore be discussed with owners. Cabergoline could be an effective alternative management option.",

The course of initial specialization of ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOTC) sensitivity to visual number processing is crucial for the acquisition of numeric and arithmetic skills. We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of vOTC activation across five time points in kindergarten (T1, mean age 6.60 years), middle and end of first grade (T2, 7.38 years; T3, 7.68 years), second grade (T4, 8.28 years), and fifth grade (T5, 11.40 years). A combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal EEG data of a total of 62 children (35 female) at varying familial risk for dyslexia were available to form groups of 23, 22, 27, 27, and 42 participants for each of the five time points. The children performed a target detection task which included visual presentation of single digits (DIG), false fonts (FF), and letters (LET) to derive measures for coarse (DIG vs. FF) and fine (DIG vs. LET) digit sensitive processing across development. The N1 amplitude analyses indicated coarse and fine sensitivity characterized by a stronger N1 to digits than false fonts across all five time points, and stronger N1 to digits than letters at all but the second (T2) time point. In addition, lower arithmetic skills were associated with stronger coarse N1 digit sensitivity over the left hemisphere in second grade (T4), possibly reflecting allocation of more attentional resources or stronger reliance on the verbal system in children with poorer arithmetic skills. To summarize, our results show persistent visual N1 sensitivity to digits that is already present early on in pre-school and remains stable until fifth grade. This pattern of digit sensitivity development clearly differs from the relatively sharp rise and fall of the visual N1 sensitivity to words or letters between kindergarten and middle of elementary school and suggests unique developmental trajectories for visual processing of written characters that are relevant to numeracy and literacy.",

Yet, reactive and proactive aggression and CU traits may co-occur to varying degrees across individuals. We aimed to investigate emotion recognition in more homogeneous clusters based on these three dimensions. In a sample of 243 youth (149 with disruptive behavior problems and 94 controls) aged 8-18 years, we used model-based clustering on self-report measures of CU traits and reactive and proactive aggression and compared the resulting clusters on emotion recognition (accuracy and response bias) and working memory. In addition to a Low and Low-Moderate symptom cluster, we identified two high CU clusters. The CU-Reactive cluster showed high reactive and low-to-medium proactive aggression; the CU-Mixed cluster showed high reactive and proactive aggression. Both CU clusters showed impaired fear recognition and working memory, whereas the CU-Reactive cluster also showed impaired recognition of disgust and sadness, partly explained by poor working memory, as well as a response bias for anger and happiness. Our results confirm the importance of CU traits as a core dimension along which youth with disruptive behavior may be characterized, yet challenge the view that high CU traits are closely linked to high proactive aggression per se. Notably, distinct neurocognitive processes may play a role in youth with high CU traits and reactive aggression with lower versus higher proactive aggression.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Callous-unemotional traits; Disruptive behavior problems; Emotion recognition; Proactive aggression; Reactive aggression",

Moreover, the majority of studies have focused only on predefined regions or functional networks rather than connectivity throughout the entire brain. Here, we investigated differences in resting-state functional connectivity between OCD patients and healthy controls (HC) using mega-analysis of data from 1,024 OCD patients and 1,028 HC from 28 independent samples of the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. We assessed group differences in whole-brain functional connectivity at both the regional and network level, and investigated whether functional connectivity could serve as biomarker to identify patient status at the individual level using machine learning analysis. The mega-analyses revealed widespread abnormalities in functional connectivity in OCD, with global hypo-connectivity (Cohen\u2019s d: -0.27 to -0.13) and few hyper-connections, mainly with the thalamus (Cohen\u2019s d: 0.19 to 0.22). Most hypo-connections were located within the sensorimotor network and no fronto-striatal abnormalities were found. Overall, classification performances were poor, with area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) scores ranging between 0.567 and 0.673, with better classification for medicated (AUC=0.702) than unmedicated (AUC=0.608) patients versus healthy controls. These findings provide partial support for existing pathophysiological models of OCD and highlight the important role of the sensorimotor network in OCD. However, resting-state connectivity does not so far provide an accurate biomarker for identifying patients at the individual level.",

The primary aim was to identify definitions of esophagogastric OMD. A secondary aim was to perform a meta-analysis of OS after local treatment versus systemic therapy alone for OMD.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nStudies and study protocols reporting on definitions or OS after local treatment for esophagogastric OMD were included. The primary outcome was the maximum number of organs/lesions considered OMD and the maximum number of lesions per organ (i.e. 'organ-specific' OMD burden). Agreement was considered to be either absent/poor (< 50%), fair (50%-75%), or consensus (\u2265 75%). The secondary outcome was the pooled adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for OS after local treatment versus systemic therapy alone. The ROBINS tool was used for quality assessment.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nA total of 97 studies, including 7 study protocols, and 2 prospective studies, were included. OMD was considered in 1 organ with \u2264 3 metastases (consensus). 'Organ-specific' OMD burden could involve bilobar \u2264 3 liver metastases, unilateral \u2264 2 lung metastases, 1 extra-regional lymph node station, \u2264 2 brain metastases, or bilateral adrenal gland metastases (consensus). Local treatment for OMD was associated with improved OS compared with systemic therapy alone based on 6 non-randomized studies (pooled aHR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.30-0.74) and for liver oligometastases based on 5 non-randomized studies (pooled aHR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.22-0.59).

Radiotherapy might be superior to temozolomide. Recent studies have linked temozolomide with induction of hypermutation and poor clinical course in some IDH-mutant gliomas.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nIn this retrospective study, 183 patients with astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, CNS WHO grade 2 or 3 and diagnosed between 2001 and 2019 were included. Patients initially monitored by wait-and-scan strategies or treated with radiotherapy or temozolomide alone were studied. Patient data were correlated with outcome. Matched pair and subgroup analyses were conducted.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nRadiotherapy was associated with longer progression-free survival than temozolomide (6.2 vs 3.4\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and wait-and-scan strategies (6.2 vs 4\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Patients treated with radiotherapy lived longer than patients treated with temozolomide (14.4 vs 10.7\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.02). Survival was longer in the wait-and-scan cohort than in the temozolomide cohort (not reached vs 10.7\u00a0years, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Patients from the wait-and-scan cohort receiving temozolomide at first progression had significantly shorter survival times than patients treated with any other therapy at first progression (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

With the use of new radiotherapy techniques, which allow for conformal treatment plans, image guidance, and short fractionation schemes, the use of re-irradiation for different sites is increasing in clinical settings. Yet, prospective evidence on re-irradiation is scarce and our understanding of the underlying radiobiology is poor. Our consensus on re-irradiation aims to assist in re-irradiation decision making, and to standardise the classification of different forms of re-irradiation and reporting. The consensus has been endorsed by the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer. The use of this classification in daily clinical practice and research will facilitate accurate understanding of the clinical implications of re-irradiation and allow for cross-study comparisons. Data gathered in a uniform manner could be used in the future to make recommendations for re-irradiation on the basis of clinical evidence. The consensus document is based on an adapted Delphi process and a systematic review of the literature was done according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).",

Seemingly a punishing and mysterious place, it is unsurprising students might regard the upper fingerboard with more than a little trepidation. This fear may have negative consequences for string player development, such as avoidance and increased tension, which can lead to awkward fingering choices, poor sound quality, problematic intonation, and the risk of developing performance injuries.

However, little research has investigated these relations following a transactional model of child development. This study investigated the bidirectional associations between student-teacher relationships and oppositional behaviors towards teachers using the \u2018Zurich Project on the Social Development from Childhood to Adulthood\u2019 (n\u2009=\u20091527; median ages 11, 13 and 15; 49% female). Results of a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model suggested that, among boys, positive student-teacher bonds at age 13 were associated with fewer teacher-reported oppositional behaviors two years later. The results indicated that negative interactions with teachers may be part of vicious cycles of poor relationships and increased levels of oppositional behavior, particularly for boys in late adolescence.",

Although the treatment had an impact on several secondary outcomes, effects were not observed for the primary outcome. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to examine heterogeneity in treatment responses. The initial RCT randomized participants to either a treatment or psychoeducational control condition. We conducted an exploratory latent class analysis to distinguish individuals based on pre-treatment risk and then used moderated regressions to examine differential treatment responses based on class membership. We found evidence for three distinct groups. Most participants fell in the \u201clow severity\u201d group (n = 123), followed by the \u201cmoderate severity\u201d group (n = 57) who had a higher likelihood of endorsing a previous mental health diagnosis and treatment and higher symptom severity than the low group. The \u201chigh severity\u201d group (n = 42) endorsed a family history of alcoholism, and the highest symptom severity and executive dysfunction. Moderated regressions revealed significant class differences in treatment responses. In the treatment condition, high severity (relative to low) participants reported higher alcohol consumption and hazardous drinking and lower quality of life at follow-up, whereas moderate severity (relative to low) individuals had lower alcohol consumption at follow-up, and lower hazardous drinking at end-of-treatment. No class differences were found for participants in the control group. Higher risk individuals in the treatment condition had poorer responses to the program. Tailoring interventions to severity may be important to examine in future research.",

Therefore, the usefulness of the current WFNS grading system for identifying the worst scenarios for clinical studies and for making treatment decisions is limited. We previously modified the WFNS scale by requiring positive signs of brain stem dysfunction to assign grade V. This study aimed to validate the new herniation WFNS grading system in an independent prospective cohort.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWe conducted an international prospective multicentre study in poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients comparing the WFNS classification with a modified version-the herniation WFNS scale (hWFNS). Here, only patients who showed positive signs of brain stem dysfunction (posturing, anisocoric, or bilateral dilated pupils) were assigned hWFNS grade V. Outcome was assessed by modified Rankin Scale score 6 months after hemorrhage. The primary end point was the difference in specificity of the WFNS and hWFNS grading with respect to poor outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score 4-6).\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOf the 250 patients included, 237 reached the primary end point. Comparing the WFNS and hWFNS scale after neurological resuscitation, the specificity to predict poor outcome increased from 0.19 (WFNS) to 0.93 (hWFNS) (McNemar, P<0.001) whereas the sensitivity decreased from 0.88 to 0.37 (P<0.001), and the positive predictive value from 61.9 to 88.3 (weighted generalized score statistic, P<0.001). For mortality, the specificity increased from 0.19 to 0.93 (McNemar, P<0.001), and the positive predictive value from 52.5 to 86.7 (weighted generalized score statistic, P<0.001).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe identification of objective positive signs of brain stem dysfunction significantly improves the specificity and positive predictive value with respect to poor outcome in grade V patients. Therefore, a simple modification-presence of brain stem signs is required for grade V-should be added to the WFNS classification.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION\r\n\r\nURL: https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02304328.",

A world-based survey on severe traumatic brain injury\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is going to be the third-leading cause of death worldwide, according to the WHO. Two European surveys suggested that adherence to brain trauma guidelines is poor. No study has compared compliance between low- (LMICs) and high-income (UHICs) countries. Hence, this study aimed to investigate differences in the management of severe TBI patients, comparing low- and high-income, and adherence to the BTF guidelines.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nA web-based survey was spread through the Global Neuro Foundation, different neurosurgical societies, and social media.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nA total of 803 neurosurgeons participated: 70.4 from UHICs and 29.6% from LMICs. Hypertonic was administered as an early measure by the 73% and 65% of the responders in LMICs and UHICs, respectively (P=0.016). An invasive intracranial pressure monitoring was recommended by the 66% and 58% of the neurosurgeons in LMICs and UHICs, respectively (P<0.001). Antiseizure drugs (P<0.001) were given most frequently in LMICs as, against recommendations, steroids (87% vs. 61% and 86% vs. 81%, respectively). In the LMICs both the evacuation of the contusion and decompressive craniectomy were performed earlier than in UHICs (30% vs. 17% with P<0.001 and 44% vs. 28% with P=0.006, respectively). In the LMICs, the head CT control was performed mostly between 12 and 24 hours from the first imaging (38% vs. 23%, P<0.001).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe current Guidelines on TBI do not always fit to both the resources and circumstances in different countries.

An expected proportion of the included patients had non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage In this post-hoc study, we will investigate whether ultra-early and short-term tranexamic acid treatment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage improves clinical outcome at six months.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nThe ULTRA-trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label trial with blinded outcome assessment, conducted between July 24, 2013 and January 20, 2020. After confirmation of subarachnoid hemorrhage on non-contrast computer tomography, patients were allocated to either ultra-early and short-term tranexamic acid treatment with usual care, or usual care only. In this post-hoc analysis, we included all ULTRA-participants with a confirmed aneurysm on CT angiography and/or digital subtraction angiography.

Safety concerns likely influence individual IVT treatment decisions. Using data from a large IVT registry, we aimed to provide more evidence on safety of IVT in the very elderly.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nIn this prospective multicenter study from the TRISP (Thrombolysis in Ischemic Stroke Patients) registry, we compared patients \u226590 years with those <90 years using symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ECASS [European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study]-II criteria), death, and poor functional outcome in survivors (modified Rankin Scale score 3-5 for patients with prestroke modified Rankin Scale score \u22642 and modified Rankin Scale score 4-5 for patients prestroke modified Rankin Scale \u22653) at 3 months as outcomes. We calculated adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI using logistic regression models.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOf 16\u2009974 eligible patients, 976 (5.7%) were \u226590 years. Patients \u226590 years had higher median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission (12 versus 8) and were more often dependent prior to the index stroke (prestroke modified Rankin Scale score of \u22653; 45.2% versus 7.4%). Occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (5.7% versus 4.4%, odds ratio$_{adjusted}$ 1.14 [0.83-1.57]) did not differ significantly between both groups. However, the probability of death (odds ratio$_{adjusted}$ 3.77 [3.14-4.53]) and poor functional outcome (odds ratio$_{adjusted}$ 2.63 [2.13-3.25]) was higher in patients aged \u226590 years. Results for the sample of centenarians (n=21) were similar.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe probability of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage after IVT in very elderly patients with stroke did not exceed that of their younger counterparts. The higher probability of death and poor functional outcome during follow-up in the very elderly seems not to be related to IVT treatment. Very high age itself should not be a reason to withhold IVT.",

The BRAFV600E-mutation found in approximately 8-12% of mCRC patients is associated with poor prognosis. Guideline recommendations for this population are mostly based on small cohorts due to lack of clinical data. This retrospective analysis was designed to evaluate (approved) therapeutic approaches and algorithms in BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC prior to approval of the targeted combination encorafenib plus cetuximab in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nPatients and methods: Anonymized data from BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC patients were analyzed retrospectively regarding 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-line treatment using descriptive statistics.\r\n\r\nResults: Forty-two patients were eligible for analysis (mean age 62.1 years, 47.6% female). At initial diagnosis, 20 patients (47.6%) were documented with right-sided tumors. Most patients (81.0%) were tested for BRAF before 1st-line. Four patients (9.5%) showed high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). Based on 94 treatment lines, chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy (TT) was used mostly (61.7%), followed by chemotherapy alone (19.1%). Backbone therapies were most frequently FOLFOXIRI (27.7%), FOLFOX/CAPOX (22.3%), or FOLFIRI (20.2%). Anti-VEGF/VEGFR and anti-EGFR-treatments were used in 45.7% and 23.4% of patients, respectively. Across all treatment lines and types, the predominantly documented reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Combined chemotherapy+TT (anti-VEGF/VEGFR and anti-EGFR) played a predominant role in BRAFV600E-mutated mCRC treatment prior to approval of the targeted combination encorafenib plus cetuximab. Since lack of efficacy was the major reason for treatment discontinuation, newly approved therapies including encorafenib plus cetuximab and - for MSI-H tumors - pembrolizumab represent urgently needed options for future mCRC patients.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Austria; Chemotherapy; Germany; Switzerland; disease characteristics; targeted therapy; treatment reality.",

Yet, public goods rely on cooperation which can break down because of free-riding incentives. Previous research extensively investigated how groups solve this free-rider problem but ignored another challenge to public goods provision. Namely, some individuals do not need public goods to solve the problems they share with others. We investigate how such self-reliance influences cooperation by confronting groups in a laboratory experiment with a safety problem that could be solved either cooperatively or individually. We show that self-reliance leads to a decline in cooperation. Moreover, asymmetries in self-reliance undermine social welfare and increase wealth inequality between group members. Less dependent group members often choose to solve the shared problem individually, while more dependent members frequently fail to solve the problem, leaving them increasingly poor. While self-reliance circumvents the free-rider problem, it complicates the governing of the commons.",

        "document": "Title: Perceptions and Attitudes of Correctional Staff Toward ADHD\u2014A Challenging Disorder in Everyday Prison Life\nAbstract: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with risk-taking behaviors, poor self-control, and interpersonal difficulties. Affected individuals have an increased probability of involvement with the criminal justice system, contributing to a higher rate of arrest, and imprisonment compared with the general population; they are also inadequately treated once sentenced. Because prison staff play a central role in the identification of inmates with mental disorders, they could well be key to improving provision of care. There is however little knowledge of the conceptions, perceptions, and attitudes of prison staff toward ADHD. Such information could help to identify starting points for awareness training and further implementation of specific ADHD treatment. To bridge this gap, we undertook a study based on a qualitatively-driven mixed methods design, combining qualitative data collection in the form of narrative interviews with 19 prison staff from a Swiss correctional facility with quantitative data collection in the form of a survey that included the Attitudes toward Prisoners scale. The interviews were analyzed with QSR NVIVO 11 and a qualitative content analysis approach was used to evaluate findings. Prison staff were generally aware of ADHD and its symptomology, believing it to a be \"real,\" but \"fashionable\" disorder and favoring hereditary-genetic or biological explanatory models for its development. They viewed inmates with ADHD rather negatively, as complicating correctional efforts, and perceived them as sticking out, as tying up more resources and as frequently being involved in confrontations. Our findings suggest that difficulties in pragmatic aspects of communication and language comprehension may be perceived \"as not listening or following instructions,\" creating additional tensions. Consequently, inmates with ADHD are more often exposed to disciplinary sanctions, such as solitary confinement-an intervention deemed \"necessary\" by staff. Therefore, staff training on ADHD might need to cover evidence on adverse effects. Non-pharmacological interventions for treatment were preferred and considered to be highly efficacious. Skepticism toward pharmacological treatment prevailed, even when benefits from stimulant medication were described. Interestingly, this skepticism was not the result of negative experiences with the misuse and diversion of stimulants. Acceptance of multimodal treatment among prison staff may require customized strategies.",

Pairs were matched according to 14 clinically relevant covariates assessing psychosocial impairments, functioning deficits and illness severity. The two outcomes of interest were the number and total duration of all rehospitalisations over a 12-month follow-up after discharge from the hospital based on the official clinical registry. Results: Altogether 35.6% of antidepressant users were rehospitalised at least once, as compared to 22.2% in matched non-users. Two or more rehospitalisations occurred in 22.2% of antidepressant users but only in 2.2% of non-users. In antidepressant users, the mean total duration of rehospitalisations was 22.22 days, as compared to 8.51 in matched non-users. According to Poisson regression analyses, antidepressant use during acute inpatient care prospectively relates to both a higher risk (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 3.64, 95% confidence interval [95%-CI] = 1.71-7.75, p = 0.001) and a longer duration (IRR = 2.61, 95%-CI = 1.01-6.79, p = 0.049) of subsequent rehospitalisations. These findings were consistently replicated when traditional multivariable regression analysis was applied to the full sample. Findings also replicated when patients with affective and non-affective disorders were analyzed separately. Conclusions: Our findings raise the possibility that, in the long-term, antidepressants may impair recovery and increase the risk of rehospitalisation in patients with both primarily affective and non-affective disorders. More work is required to explore possible aetiopathological pathways leading to psychiatric rehospitalisation.",

        "document": "Title: Predictors of Compulsory Re-admission to Psychiatric Inpatient Care\nAbstract: Objective: This prospective study addresses risk factors of compulsory re-admission focusing on the role of the patient's subjective symptom distress and perceived social support, based on comprehensive patient and external (clinicians, study staff) assessments. Methods: Of the baseline sample, 168 (71%) patients with serious mental disorders, who had been compulsorily admitted to psychiatric inpatient care, were followed over 24 months after discharge within the framework of a RCT. Results: During this time 36% had compulsory re-admissions; risk was highest immediately after discharge. Regression models identified a history of previous compulsory hospitalisations and compulsory admission due to endangerment of others as the predictors most strongly associated with the outcome. Patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder or an emotionally instable or combined personality disorder were most likely to experience compulsory re-hospitalisation, with poor response to treatment further significantly increasing the risk. The patient ratings of subjective symptom distress or perceived social support had no predictive value for compulsory re-admission, and this study did not provide evidence for a significant prognostic relevance of sociodemographic background factors. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that within individual-level variables disease-related factors are essentially the strongest predictors, but including the patients' subjective perspective does not enhance the prediction of compulsory re-hospitalisation. The psychiatric treatment of patients with recurrent and often challenging behavioural problems, at the more severe end of the spectrum of mental disorders, deserves closer attention if the use of compulsory hospitalisation is to be reduced.",

Increases in physical activity are associated with improvements in symptoms of mental illness and reduction in cardiometabolic risk. Reliable and valid clinical tools that assess physical activity would improve evaluation of intervention studies that aim to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour in people living with mental illness.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nThe five-item Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire (SIMPAQ) was developed by a multidisciplinary, international working group as a clinical tool to assess physical activity and sedentary behaviour in people living with mental illness. Patients with a DSM or ICD mental illness diagnoses were recruited and completed the SIMPAQ on two occasions, one week apart. Participants wore an Actigraph accelerometer and completed brief cognitive and clinical assessments.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nEvidence of SIMPAQ validity was assessed against accelerometer-derived measures of physical activity. Data were obtained from 1010 participants. The SIMPAQ had good test-retest reliability. Correlations for moderate-vigorous physical activity was comparable to studies conducted in general population samples. Evidence of validity for the sedentary behaviour item was poor. An alternative method to calculate sedentary behaviour had stronger evidence of validity. This alternative method is recommended for use in future studies employing the SIMPAQ.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe SIMPAQ is a brief measure of physical activity and sedentary behaviour that can be reliably and validly administered by health professionals.",

While existing research has focused on the impact of migration inflows of poor households on states with high provision of social expenditure, it has remained silent with regard to migration outflows. In this article, I argue that migration outflows are associated with increased social expenditure if eligibility restrictions for social benefits between states are relaxed. Facing outflows of workers and the unemployed, low-spending states respond with increases in social expenditure to retain a sufficient workforce and counteract rising wage levels. As a result, states with higher levels of outward migration are catching up with more generous states instead of engaging in a race to the bottom. To support my claim, I use a time-series cross-sectional data set of Swiss cantons covering the period 1930\u201375.",

We, therefore, examined the impact of stigma-related emotional reactions and stigma stress on recovery over a 2-year period.\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\n\r\nShame and self-contempt as emotional reactions to involuntary hospitalisation, stigma stress, self-stigma and empowerment, as well as recovery were assessed among 186 individuals with serious mental illness and a history of recent involuntary hospitalisation.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nMore shame, self-contempt and stigma stress at baseline were correlated with increased self-stigma and reduced empowerment after 1 year.

We aimed at studying the prevalence, clinical correlates and the role of hypersomnia in a sample of acutely depressed patients. Secondarily, we factors significantly increasing the odds of hypersomnia were studied. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the BRIDGE-II-Mix study. Variables were compared between patients with hypersomnia (SLEEP+) and with insomnia (SLEEP-) with standard bivariate tests. A stepwise backward logistic regression model was performed with SLEEP+ as dependent variable. A total of 2514 subjects were dichotomized into SLEEP+ (n\u202f=\u202f423, 16.8%) and SLEEP- (n\u202f=\u202f2091, 83.2%). SLEEP+ had significant higher rates of obese BMI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), BD diagnosis (p\u202f=\u202f0.027), severe BD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), lifetime suicide attempts (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), lower age at first depression (p\u202f=\u202f0.004) than SLEEP-. Also, SLEEP+ had significantly poorer response to antidepressants (AD) such as (hypo)manic switches, AD resistance, affective lability, or irritability (all 0<0.005). Moreover, SLEEP+ had significantly higher rates of mixed-state specifiers than SLEEP- (all 0\u00a0<\u00a00.006). A significant contribution to hypersomnia in our regression model was driven by metabolic-related features, such as \"current bulimia\" (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.21) and \"overweight/obese BMI (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.42)\". Globally, hypersomnia is associated with poor outcome in acute depression. Hypersomnia is strongly associated with mixed features and bipolarity. Metabolic aspects could influence the expression of hypersomnia, worsening the overall clinical outcome. Along with commonly used screening tools, detection of hypersomnia has potential, costless discriminative validity in the differential diagnosis unipolar and bipolar depression.",

Even before the current escalation, the conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine has led to the internal displacement of more than 200,000 children, and many others have experienced attacks, e.g. on schools. This inevitably leads to limitations in health care delivery. During transit, overcrowding, poor shelter and vulnerability may further put refugees at increased risk for infectious diseases. This consensus document aims to provide information and guidance regarding health issues that paediatricians and general practitioners may face when caring for Ukrainian children.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Members of the Migrant Health Reference Group of Paediatrics Switzerland and the Paediatric Infectious Disease Group in Switzerland developed this recommendation between March and April 2022 in a modified Delphi process.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: A total of 50 recommendations were agreed on with a \u226580% consensus. These include the following topics: i) general aspects, including interpreter services, urgent health needs, personal history and general check-ups; ii) mental health, including how to search for signs of psychological distress without going into traumatic details; iii) vaccinations, including recommendations for evaluation and catch-up; iv) screening for tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B and C; and v) providing age-appropriate preventive and health service information.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: This document provides current evidence and guidance when caring for paediatric refugees from Ukraine. The recommendations focus on Switzerland but may well be used in other countries. These are based on current evidence and may need to be adapted to individual situations and once further evidence becomes available.",

Due to the multitude of underlying factors, prediction of outcomes remains poor. We aimed to identify factors governing diagnosis and survival in AMI and develop novel prognostic tools.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nThis monocentric retrospective study analyzed patients with suspected AMI undergoing imaging between January 2014 and December 2019. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with confirmed AMI undergoing surgery. Nomograms were calculated based on multivariable logistic regression models.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nFive hundred and thirty-nine patients underwent imaging for clinically suspected AMI, with 216 examinations showing radiological indication of AMI. Intestinal necrosis (IN) was confirmed in 125 undergoing surgery, 58 of which survived and 67 died (median 9\u00a0days after diagnosis, IQR 22). Increasing age, ASA score, pneumatosis intestinalis, and dilated bowel loops were significantly associated with presence of IN upon radiological suspicion. In contrast, decreased pH, elevated creatinine, radiological atherosclerosis, vascular occlusion (versus non-occlusive AMI), and colonic affection (compared to small bowel ischemia only) were associated with impaired survival in patients undergoing surgery. Based on the identified factors, we developed two nomograms to aid in prediction of IN upon radiological suspicion (C-Index\u2009=\u20090.726) and survival in patients undergoing surgery for IN (C-Index\u2009=\u20090.791).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAs AMI remains a condition with high mortality, we identified factors predicting occurrence of IN with suspected AMI and survival when undergoing surgery for IN. We provide two new tools, which combine these parameters and might prove helpful in treatment of patients with AMI.",

        "document": "Title: Living Organ Donation for Transplantation in Bangladesh: Reality and Problems\nAbstract: The stipulation of living organ transplantation policy and practice in Bangladesh is family-oriented, with relatives being the only people legally eligible to donate organs. There have been very few transplantations of bone marrows, liver lobes, and kidneys from related-living donors in Bangladesh. The major question addressed in this study is why Bangladesh is not getting adequate organs for transplantation. In this study, I examin the stipulations of the policy and practice of living organ donation through the lens of 32 key stakeholders including physicians and nurses, a health administrator, organ donors and recipients, and their family members, as they can shed light on the realities and problems of organ donation for transplantation in Bangladesh. My ethnography reveals that the family members are always encouraged to donate organs for transplantation, and saving the lives of relatives through organ donation is seen as a moral obligation. Many view saving the life of a relative by donating one\u2019s organs as equivalent to saving one\u2019s own life. An assessment of the dynamics of biomedicine, religion, and culture leads to the conclusion that the family-oriented organ donation policy and practice have been widely endorsed and accepted in Bangladesh, and Islamic ethical principles and collective family ethos undergird that policy and practice. However, the unavailability of medical resources, lack of post-operative coverage for organ donors, religious misconceptions and unawareness of the general public, and the absence of posthumously donated vital organs for transplantation are perceived to be the most common barriers to a successful living donor-recipient pair organ transplantation. By overcoming these obstacles, Bangladesh can develop a successful living donor-recipient pair organ transplantation program that will ensure improved healthcare outcomes, promote altruism and solidarity among Bangladeshi families, and protect the poor from having their organs sold to wealthy patients.",

Completers (257/527, 49%) had mean 36-month changes in VA and CST of +12 letters and -324\u03bcm with a median of 18 injections at 26 visits. The adjusted mean VA change was similar with each VEGF inhibitor (mean, +11.4 letters) despite a greater reduction in CST with aflibercept (-310\u03bcm) vs. ranibizumab (-258\u03bcm) vs. bevacizumab (-216\u03bcm; P < 0.001). Eyes with baseline VA that was trial-eligible (19-73 letters, 356/527, 68%) gained 7 letters, very-poor (<19 letters, 129/527, 24%) gained 22 letters, or very-good (>73 letters, 42/527, 8%) lost 7 letters.

All adults with PCR-confirmed influenza infection and treatment on intensive-care unit (ICU) for >24 h were included. IAPA was diagnosed according to previously published clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria. We assessed risk factors for IAPA and predictors for poor outcome, which was a composite of in-hospital mortality, ICU length of stay \u22657 days, mechanical ventilation \u22657 days, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\r\n\r\nResults: One hundred fifty-eight patients (median age 64 years, 45% females) with influenza were included, of which 17 (10.8%) had IAPA. Asthma was more common in IAPA patients (17% vs. 4% in non-IAPA, P = 0.05). Asthma (OR 12.0 [95% CI 2.1-67.2]) and days of mechanical ventilation (OR 1.1 [1.1-1.2]) were associated with IAPA. IAPA patients frequently required organ supportive therapies including mechanical ventilation (88% in IAPA vs. 53% in non-IAPA, P = 0.001) and vasoactive support (75% vs. 45%, P = 0.03) and had more complications including ARDS (53% vs. 26%, P = 0.04), respiratory bacterial infections (65% vs. 37%, P = 0.04), and higher ICU-mortality (35% vs. 16.4%, P = 0.05).

We hypothesised the effects of a target temperature of 33 \u00b0C when compared to normothermia would differ based on average time to hypothermia and those patients achieving hypothermia fastest would have more favorable outcomes.\r\n\r\nMethods: In this post-hoc analysis of the TTM-2 trial, patients after out of hospital cardiac arrest were randomized to targeted hypothermia (33 \u00b0C), followed by controlled re-warming, or normothermia with early treatment of fever (body temperature, \u2265 37.8 \u00b0C). The average temperature at 4 h (240 min) after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was calculated for participating sites. Primary outcome was death from any cause at 6 months. Secondary outcome was poor functional outcome at 6 months (score of 4-6 on modified Rankin scale).\r\n\r\nResults: A total of 1592 participants were evaluated for the primary outcome. We found no evidence of heterogeneity of intervention effect based on the average time to target temperature on mortality (p = 0.17). Of patients allocated to hypothermia at the fastest sites, 71 of 145 (49%) had died compared to 68 of 148 (46%) of the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.07; 95% confidence interval 0.84-1.36). Poor functional outcome was reported in 74/144 (51%) patients in the hypothermia group, and 75/147 (51%) patients in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia 1.01 (95% CI 0.80-1.26).\r\n\r\nConclusions: Using a hospital's average time to hypothermia did not significantly alter the effect of TTM of 33 \u00b0C compared to normothermia and early treatment of fever.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Hypothermia; Out of hospital cardiac arrest; Temperature management; Time to target temperature.",

The primary aim of this study was to describe the values of partial pressure of oxygen values (PaO2) and the episodes of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia occurring within the first 72 h of mechanical ventilation in out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. The secondary aim was to evaluate the association of PaO2 with patients' outcome.\r\n\r\nMethods: Preplanned secondary analysis of the targeted hypothermia versus targeted normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) trial. Arterial blood gases values were collected from randomization every 4 h for the first 32 h, and then, every 8 h until day 3. Hypoxemia was defined as PaO2 < 60 mmHg and severe hyperoxemia as PaO2 > 300 mmHg. Mortality and poor neurological outcome (defined according to modified Rankin scale) were collected at 6 months.\r\n\r\nResults: 1418 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 64 \u00b1 14 years, and 292 patients (20.6%) were female. 24.9% of patients had at least one episode of hypoxemia, and 7.6% of patients had at least one episode of severe hyperoxemia. Both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia were independently associated with 6-month mortality, but not with poor neurological outcome. The best cutoff point associated with 6-month mortality for hypoxemia was 69 mmHg (Risk Ratio, RR = 1.009, 95% CI 0.93-1.09), and for hyperoxemia was 195 mmHg (RR = 1.006, 95% CI 0.95-1.06). The time exposure, i.e., the area under the curve (PaO2-AUC), for hyperoxemia was significantly associated with mortality (p = 0.003).\r\n\r\nConclusions: In OHCA patients, both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia are associated with 6-months mortality, with an effect mediated by the timing exposure to high values of oxygen. Precise titration of oxygen levels should be considered in this group of patients.\r\n\r\nTrial registration: clinicaltrials.gov NCT02908308 , Registered September 20, 2016.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Cardiac arrest; Hyperoxemia; Hypoxemia; Mortality; Neurological outcome",

The optimal acute therapeutic intervention for these patients remains unknown.\r\n\r\nMethods: Patients with isolated ACA-stroke were identified from 10 centers participating in the EndoVascular treatment And ThRombolysis in Ischemic Stroke Patients (EVATRISP) prospective registry. Patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) were compared to those treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (OR; 95%CI) were calculated using multivariate regression analysis.\r\n\r\nResults: Included were 92 patients with ACA-stroke. Of the 92 ACA patients, 55 (60%) were treated with IVT only and 37 (40%) with EVT (\u00b1bridging IVT). ACA patients treated with EVT had more often wake-up stroke (24% vs. 6%, p = 0.044) and proximal ACA occlusions (43% vs. 24%, p = 0.047) and tended to have higher stroke severity on admission [NIHSS: 10.0 vs 7.0, p = 0.054). However, odds for favorable outcome, mortality or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage did not differ significantly between both groups. Exploration of the effect of clot location inside the ACA showed that in patients with A1 or A2/A3 ACA occlusions the chances of favorable outcome were not influenced by treatment allocation to IVT or EVT.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: Treatment with either IVT or EVT could be safe with similar effect in patients with ACA-strokes and these effects may be independent of clot location within the occluded ACA.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Anterior cerebral artery; Cerebrovascular disease; Endovascular; Stroke; Thrombectomy",

Although poor SQ is often reported as an early symptom of MDD or burnout, it is not clear whether HPA axis-related hormones can influence the association between SQ and MDD or burnout. This manuscript addresses this question by examining HPA axis-related hormones as potential moderators influencing the association between SQ and MDD or burnout.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth annual examination wave of the Dresden Burnout Study, we measured general SQ (including sleep duration and efficiency), depressive and burnout symptoms, and obtained hair samples for quantification of long-term integrated steroid concentrations (cortisol [hC], cortisone [hCn], dehydroepiandrosterone [hDHEA]) from 462 participants (67% female). Data on SQ, depressive and burnout symptoms were available from 342 participants from the preceding examination wave (average time span between examinations 13.2 months).\r\n\r\nCross-sectional analyses showed that the negative association between sleep duration and depressive symptoms was buffered by higher levels of hC, and hCn, whereas the negative association between sleep duration and burnout symptoms was buffered by higher levels of hDHEA. The negative association between sleep efficiency and burnout symptoms was intensified by higher levels of hC and hC/hCn ratio and the negative association between general SQ and burnout symptoms was intensified by higher levels of hC/hCn ratio. With regard to longitudinal data, a significant interaction effect between sleep duration and hC/hCn ratio could be detected for burnout symptoms.\r\n\r\nOur results suggest opposed moderation effects of hair glucocorticoids on the association between SQ and depressive or burnout symptoms. This points toward opposed glucocorticoid receptor functioning in depression and burnout. To fully elucidate the negative consequences of poor SQ on MDD and burnout, the complex underlying mechanisms of action including HPA axis-related hormones need to be investigated in MDD and burnout separately.",

Evidence from hair-based hormonal measures of 2105 rural Indian women\nAbstract: Depressive and anxiety disorders substantially contribute to the global burden of disease, particularly in poor countries. Higher prevalence rates for both disorders among women indicate sex hormones may be integrated in the pathophysiology of these disorders. The Kshetriya Gramin Financial Services study surveyed a random sample of 4160 households across 876 villages in rural Tamil Nadu, India. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was conducted to quantify depressive (K6-D) and anxiety (K6-A) symptoms. Alongside, hair samples for sex hormone profiling were collected from a subsample of 2105 women aged 18\u201385 years. Importantly, 5.9%, 14.8%, and 46.3% of samples contained non-detectable hormone levels for dehydroepiandrosterone, progesterone, and testosterone, respectively. Our primary analysis imputes values for the non-detectable sample and we check robustness of results when non-detectable values are dropped. In this cohort of women from rural India, higher depressive symptomatology is associated with lower levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and higher depressive and anxiety symptoms are associated with higher levels of testosterone. Progesterone shows no clear association with either depressive or anxiety symptoms. These results support a potential protective effect of higher endogenous dehydroepiandrosterone levels. An important caveat on the potential negative effect of hair testosterone levels on women\u2019s mental health is that the testosterone analysis is sensitive to how non-detectable values are treated.",

Second, to examine whether the timing of maternal depressive symptoms or specific unhealthy behaviors matter and whether child depressive symptoms and body mass index explain these associations.\r\n          \r\nMETHODS\r\nData came from a prospective-longitudinal community sample with multi-informant data (N = 213) from child ages 2 to17. A cumulative adolescent unhealthy behavior index was calculated, summing the presence of poor sleep, poor diet, physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and smoking. Regression analyses examined associations of maternal depressive symptoms in early childhood (ages 2 to 5), middle childhood (ages 7 to 10), and adolescence (age 15) with adolescents\u2019 unhealthy behaviors (ages 16 to17). Indirect effects of child depressive symptoms and body mass index were tested using a path model.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nAdolescents\u2019 unhealthy behaviors were common (eg, 2 out of 3 engaged in at least 1 unhealthy behavior). Higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms in middle childhood and adolescence were associated with adolescent engagement in more unhealthy behaviors at ages 16 to 17. Maternal depressive symptoms in early childhood were associated with adolescent unhealthy behaviors through indirect effects involving children\u2019s depressive symptoms and continuity of maternal depressive symptoms.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nMaternal depressive symptoms are associated with the number of adolescent unhealthy behaviors, both directly and indirectly. Promoting mothers\u2019 mental health can be crucial for promoting children\u2019s health behaviors and health.",

It is unclear how social, health, cognitive, and functional variables rank as risk/protective factors for depression among older adults and whether there are conspicuous differences among men and women.\r\n\r\nMethods: We used random forest analysis (RFA), a machine learning method, to compare 56 risk/protective factors for depression in a large representative sample of European older adults (N = 67,603; ages 45-105y; 56.1% women; 18 countries) from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE Wave 6). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the EURO-D questionnaire: Scores \u2265 4 indicated depression. Predictors included a broad array of sociodemographic, relational, health, lifestyle, and cognitive variables.\r\n\r\nFindings: Self-rated social isolation and self-rated poor health were the strongest risk factors, accounting for 22.0% (in men) and 22.3% (in women) of variability in depression. Odds ratios (OR) per +1SD in social isolation were 1.99x, 95% CI [1.90,2.08] in men; 1.93x, 95% CI [1.85,2.02] in women. OR for self-rated poor health were 1.93x, 95% CI [1.81,2.05] in men; 1.98x, 95% CI [1.87,2.10] in women. Difficulties in mobility (in both sexes), difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living (in men), and higher self-rated family burden (in women) accounted for an additional but small percentage of variance in depression risk (2.2% in men, 1.5% in women).\r\n\r\nInterpretation: Among 56 predictors, self-perceived social isolation and self-rated poor health were the most salient risk factors for depression in middle-aged and older men and women. Difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living (in men) and increased family burden (in women) appear to differentially influence depression risk across sexes.",

Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) may reveal additional insights by measuring the EEG hallmarks of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, namely slow waves and spindles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that EDS in PD is associated with nocturnal sleep disturbance revealed by quantitative NREM sleep EEG markers.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nPatients with PD (n = 130) underwent polysomnography followed by spectral analysis to calculate spindle frequency activity, slow-wave activity (SWA), and overnight SWA decline, which reflects the dissipation of homeostatic sleep pressure. We used the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to assess subjective daytime sleepiness and define EDS (ESS > 10). All examinations were part of an evaluation for deep brain stimulation.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nPatients with EDS (n = 46) showed reduced overnight decline of SWA (p = 0.036) and reduced spindle frequency activity (p = 0.032) compared with patients without EDS. Likewise, more severe daytime sleepiness was associated with reduced SWA decline (\u00df= \u22120.24 p = 0.008) and reduced spindle frequency activity (\u00df= \u22120.42, p < 0.001) across all patients. Reduced SWA decline, but not daytime sleepiness, was associated with poor sleep quality and continuity at polysomnography.\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nOur data suggest that daytime sleepiness in PD patients is associated with sleep disturbance revealed by quantitative EEG, namely reduced overnight SWA decline and reduced spindle frequency activity. These findings could indicate that poor sleep quality, with incomplete dissipation of homeostatic sleep pressure, may contribute to EDS in PD.",

Extracellular chromatin drives pathology, but the mechanisms enabling its accumulation remain elusive. Here, we show that in murine sepsis models, splenocyte death interferes with chromatin clearance through the release of the DNase I inhibitor actin. Actin-mediated inhibition was compensated by upregulation of DNase I or the actin scavenger gelsolin. Splenocyte death and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) clearance deficiencies were prevalent in individuals with severe COVID-19 pneumonia or microbial sepsis. Activity tracing by plasma proteomic profiling uncovered an association between low NET clearance and increased COVID-19 pathology and mortality. Low NET clearance activity with comparable proteome associations was prevalent in healthy donors with low-grade inflammation, implicating defective chromatin clearance in the development of cardiovascular disease and linking COVID-19 susceptibility to pre-existing conditions. Hence, the combination of aberrant chromatin release with defects in protective clearance mechanisms lead to poor survival outcomes.",

Patients who received concurrent locoregional, radiation, or other systemic therapies were excluded. Response was assessed by 2 observers in consensus using RECIST1.1, mRECIST, and iRECIST at 3/6/9/12-month time points. Time to progression (TTP) and OS were recorded. Clinicolaboratory and imaging variables were evaluated as predictors of PD and OS using uni-/multivariable and Cox regression analyses.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nFifty-eight patients (42M/16F) were included. 118 target lesions (TL) were identified before treatment.

Corpora like Early English Books Online (EEBO), Corpus of Late Modern English Texts (CLMET) and Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) allow us to apply statistical data-driven models extracting patterns to confirm our expectations. As systems biology has revolutionised biology by systematically searching for all patterns, we detect patterns in our data systematically with contextual and distributional semantic approaches, an approach that could be called systems history. We uncover semantic patterns with methods from text mining, computational linguistics and digital humanities. We normalise the spelling automatically to present-day variants and use bottom-up analyses to step from words to concepts: collocations, topic modelling and distributional semantics. We illustrate the approaches with two case studies: associations of poverty changing across time, and Charles Dickens social criticism, his vision of helping to improve the situation of the poor. As no gold standard for our task exists, our approaches are exploratory, which entails considerable manual intervention, e.g. sifting candidate lists, reading excerpts and interpreting topic models. A fully automatic approach is currently neither feasible nor envisaged: semi-automatic approaches give researchers the inspiring opportunity to interact with the texts in a constant move between distant and close reading. The different characteristics of the various statistical methods offer complementary perspectives.",

        "document": "Title: Social Justice and the Judicial Interpretation of International Equal Protection Law\nAbstract: Social justice is turning into an international concern. This development is a response to the continuous rise of socioeconomic inequality \u2013 the gap between the rich and the poor \u2013growing in several OECD member states since the 1970s. International human rights law (IHRL) presently only establishes a weak normative framework regarding social justice. This article argues that the full potential of this framework has still not been activated by international human rights adjudication. There are several reasons for this: a complex history of ideas suggesting little common understanding of the notion of social justice, the focus of international human rights adjudication on individual rather than constitutional justice, and the priority of liberty rights over equality rights. Yet, the domination of the liberal over the social in international human rights adjudication has started to change. The article shows how the social justice concern is beginning to be incorporated into IHRL by judicial interpretation of international equal protection and non-discrimination law (international equal protection law, IEPL). Integrating the social justice concern into IEPL is a legitimate yet transformative step as it increases judicial discretion at the international level. More than many other human rights, socioeconomic equality is highly context-specific and depends on a complex factual assessment of the local circumstances. This exacerbates the institutional legitimacy challenge levelled against international human rights courts. However, the article argues that the legitimacy challenge can be alleviated by focusing more on procedural rather than a substantive international review.",

Negative images of old age can lead to ageism and poorer healthcare for older people. The younger generation will have to master these demographic challenges. Therefore, their attitude towards and their perception of the older generation has to be monitored. The aim of this study is to present the images of ageing held by dental students who received education in gerodontology and to assess possible changes between different generations of students over time and separated by gender. An annual, anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted among dental students at the end of the 10th semester each year between 2008 and 2021. The questionnaire surveyed personal attitudes towards ageing, the assessment of seniors, and personal experience with seniors (images of ageing, \"Aging Semantic Differential\"). In addition to confirming Friedan's phenomenon regarding the assessment of age limits, the present study was able to demonstrate a positive image of ageing in dental students, which has remained almost constant over the years. An education in gerodontology might positively influence student perceptions of age and aging.",

Because most of these screens have been performed in vitro using established cell lines, evaluating the physiologic relevance of these targets is critical. We have established a CRISPR screening approach using orthotopic xenograft models to validate and prioritize AML-enriched dependencies in vivo, including in CRISPR-competent AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models tractable for genome editing. Our integrated pipeline has revealed several targets with translational value, including SLC5A3 as a metabolic vulnerability for AML addicted to exogenous myo-inositol and MARCH5 as a critical guardian to prevent apoptosis in AML. MARCH5 repression enhanced the efficacy of BCL2 inhibitors such as venetoclax, further highlighting the clinical potential of targeting MARCH5 in AML. Our study provides a valuable strategy for discovery and prioritization of new candidate AML therapeutic targets. SIGNIFICANCE: There is an unmet need to improve the clinical outcome of AML. We developed an integrated in vivo screening approach to prioritize and validate AML dependencies with high translational potential. We identified SLC5A3 as a metabolic vulnerability and MARCH5 as a critical apoptosis regulator in AML, both of which represent novel therapeutic opportunities.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 275.",

The feasibility, safety, and activity of tisagenlecleucel have not been defined in this group, the majority of whom have high-risk (KMT2A-rearranged) infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and historically poor outcomes despite intensification of chemotherapy, and for whom novel therapies are urgently needed. We aimed to provide real-world outcome analysis of the feasibility, activity, and safety of tisagenlecleucel in younger children and infants with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWe did an international, multicentre, retrospective cohort study at 15 hospitals across ten countries in Europe. Eligible patients were children aged younger than 3 years at screening between Sept 1, 2018, and Sept 1, 2021, who were screened for tisagenlecleucel therapy for relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia according to licensed indications. Patients received a single intravenous infusion of tisagenlecleucel. We tracked chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy outcomes using a standardised data reporting form. Overall survival, event-free survival, stringent event-free survival, B-cell aplasia, and toxicity were assessed in all patients who received a tisagenlecleucel infusion.\r\n\r\nFINDINGS\r\n\r\n38 eligible patients were screened, of whom 35 (92%) received a tisagenlecleucel infusion. 29 (76%) of 38 patients had KMT2A-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and 25 (66%) had relapsed after previous allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients had previously received a median of 2 lines (IQR 2-3) of (non-HSCT) therapy. Seven (18%) of 38 patients had received inotuzumab and 14 (37%) had received blinatumomab. After a median of 14 months (IQR 9-21) of follow-up, overall survival at 12 months after tisagenlecleucel infusion was 84% (64-93; five patients had died), event-free survival was 69% (47-83; nine events), and stringent event-free survival was 41% (23-58; 18 events). The probability of ongoing B-cell aplasia was 70% (95% CI 46-84; seven events) at 12 months. Adverse events included cytokine release syndrome, which occurred at any grade in 21 (60%) of 35 patients and at grade 3 or worse in five (14%), and neurotoxicity at any grade in nine (26%), none of which were severe. Measurable residual disease-negative complete response with or without haematological recovery occurred in 24 (86%) of 28 patients who had measurable disease.\r\n\r\nINTERPRETATION\r\n\r\nThese data suggest that tisagenlecleucel has antitumour activity and has an acceptable safety profile for young children and infants with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.",

Data on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are limited. We determined the efficacy of ICIs in MM, analyzed by primary site and ethnicity/race.\r\n\r\nPatients and methods: A retrospective cohort study from 25 cancer centers in Australia, Europe, USA and Asia was carried out. Patients with histologically confirmed MM were treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) \u00b1 ipilimumab. Primary endpoints were response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) by primary site (naso-oral, urogenital, anorectal, other), ethnicity/race (Caucasian, Asian, Other) and treatment. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analyses were conducted.\r\n\r\nResults: In total, 545 patients were included: 331 (63%) Caucasian, 176 (33%) Asian and 20 (4%) Other. Primary sites included 113 (21%) anorectal, 178 (32%) urogenital, 206 (38%) naso-oral and 45 (8%) other. Three hundred and forty-eight (64%) patients received anti-PD-1 and 197 (36%) anti-PD-1/ipilimumab. RR, PFS and OS did not differ by primary site, ethnicity/race or treatment. RR for naso-oral was numerically higher for anti-PD-1/ipilimumab [40%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 29% to 54%] compared with anti-PD-1 (29%, 95% CI 21% to 37%). Thirty-five percent of patients who initially responded progressed. The median duration of response (mDoR) was 26 months (95% CI 18 months-not reached). Factors associated with short PFS were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) \u22653 (P < 0.01), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) more than the upper limit of normal (ULN) (P = 0.01), lung metastases (P < 0.01) and \u22651 previous treatments (P < 0.01). Factors associated with short OS were ECOG PS \u22651 (P < 0.01), LDH >ULN (P = 0.03), lung metastases (P < 0.01) and \u22651 previous treatments (P < 0.01).\r\n\r\nConclusions: MM has poor prognosis. Treatment efficacy of anti-PD-1 \u00b1 ipilimumab was similar and did not differ by ethnicity/race. Naso-oral primaries had numerically higher response to anti-PD-1/ipilimumab, without difference in survival. The addition of ipilimumab did not show greater benefit over anti-PD-1 for other primary sites. In responders, mDoR was short and acquired resistance was common. Other factors, including site and number of metastases, were associated with survival.\r\n\r\nKeywords: anti-PD-1; ethnicity/race; immunotherapy; ipilimumab; mucosal melanoma",

A self-report on-line survey was completed by 553 adolescents (age-range 12\u201318\u00a0years in 2021) in the summers of 2020 and 2021, assessing symptoms of various mental health problems, perceived COVID-19-related stressors, and coping strategies. Overall, participants reported less COVID-19 related stress one year after the lockdown, though mental health status remained stable. \u2018Challenges at home or with others\u2019 were significantly associated with mental health problems in both genders, whereas \u2018trouble getting medical care or mental health services \u2018was associated with mental health problems in girls. Perceived stress and pre-existing psychiatric problem were significantly linked to all mental health outcomes at both time points. Parents\u2019 poor relationships with partners during the lockdown was associated with increased anxiety symptoms in their children. Using cognitive restructuring to cope with stress was associated with less, while negative coping was associated with more anxiety, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms one year post lockdown. Girls appear to have been more affected by the pandemic than boys, with youths with pre-existing psychiatric problems especially vulnerable to its detrimental effects. Healthcare and school professionals should support to identify high-risk adolescents with negative and avoidant coping strategies and train youths to use positive coping strategies.",

Therefore, identifying which critically ill intubated COVID-19 patients will benefit may help allocate labor resources.\r\n\r\nMethods: From the multi-center Dutch Data Warehouse of COVID-19 ICU patients from 25 hospitals, we selected all 3619 episodes of prone positioning in 1142 invasively mechanically ventilated patients. We excluded episodes longer than 24 h. Berlin ARDS criteria were not formally documented. We used supervised machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine and Extreme Gradient Boosting on readily available and clinically relevant features to predict success of prone positioning after 4 h (window of 1 to 7 h) based on various possible outcomes. These outcomes were defined as improvements of at least 10% in PaO2/FiO2 ratio, ventilatory ratio, respiratory system compliance, or mechanical power. Separate models were created for each of these outcomes. Re-supination within 4 h after pronation was labeled as failure. We also developed models using a 20 mmHg improvement cut-off for PaO2/FiO2 ratio and using a combined outcome parameter. For all models, we evaluated feature importance expressed as contribution to predictive performance based on their relative ranking.\r\n\r\nResults: The median duration of prone episodes was 17 h (11-20, median and IQR, N = 2632). Despite extensive modeling using a plethora of machine learning techniques and a large number of potentially clinically relevant features, discrimination between responders and non-responders remained poor with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.62 for PaO2/FiO2 ratio using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost. Feature importance was inconsistent between models for different outcomes. Notably, not even being a previous responder to prone positioning, or PEEP-levels before prone positioning, provided any meaningful contribution to predicting a successful next proning episode.\r\n\r\nConclusions: In mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, predicting the success of prone positioning using clinically relevant and readily available parameters from electronic health records is currently not feasible. Given the current evidence base, a liberal approach to proning in all patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS is therefore justified and in particular regardless of previous results of proning.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19; Mechanical ventilation.",

The present study explores if similar disparities exist in terms of psycho-oncological support.\r\n\r\nLatent class analysis (LCA) was used to group 10,945 patients with any type of cancer, of which 72 (0.7%) had been diagnosed with a SMI (ICD10-codes F20-F22, F24, F25, F28-F31, F32.3, F33.3), and 1056 (9.6%) with another mental disorder. Subgrouping was based on presence of SMI, other mental illnesses, stage of cancer at its first detection, screening for distress and receipt of information on psycho-oncology, consultation with a psychotherapist and/or psychiatrist, prescription of different psychotropic medication, and use of a patient care attendant.\r\n\r\nFive subgroups were identified. Patients with SMI were most likely to suffer from further mental comorbidities, to be prescribed antipsychotics, antidepressants, or mood stabilizers, and be in need of a patient care attendant. In comparison to patients without SMI, the larger one of 2 subgroups of patients with SMI had a low probability to be screened for distress and informed about psycho-oncological support services. A smaller subgroup of patients with SMI was probable to be diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer. In subgroups without patients with mental disorders, screening for distress and offering psycho-oncological support seemed to be economized unless benzodiazepines or opioids were prescribed.\r\n\r\nContrary to published evidence, distress screening and offering psycho-oncological support is neglected in patients with SMI unless an advanced stage of cancer is being diagnosed.",

As COVID19 forced us to isolate ourselves, we are in a better position to understand consequences of social distancing. The recent literature showed that older incarcerated adults are particularly at risk of health-related complications due to isolation in the prison environment, reducing their social capital. Mental and physical health can be severely affected by loneliness and social isolation, especially in prison.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nOur qualitative study investigates the view of older persons deprieved of their liberty on loneliness and social isolation pertaining to their mental health. We interviewed 57 older participants, including imprisoned individuals and forensic patients, following a semi-structured interview guide. During the data management and data analysis process, we excluded 7 interviews which were of poorer quality. Thereafter, we analyzed the remainders following a thematic approach.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nMost interviewees experience loneliness following lack of significant human relationships in prison. Making friends appears to be a challenge for all the participants, because, for one thing, they do not find people with similar interests. Also, secure institution setting aggravates isolation due to the restrictions of movement placed such as rules concerning movement between floors, hindering intimate relationship, and separation between friends. Moreover, contact with prison personnel is limited and lack social capital (e.g. trust).\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nTo our knowledge, this study is one of the first to present incarcerated persons\u2019 perspective on loneliness, social isolation and poor social capital in the Swiss prison setting. These has been reported to cause health problems both somatic and psychological. Our participants experience these deleterious factors in detention. As prisons have the possibility to become a health-promoting environment through connectedness, friendship, and trust promotion, stakeholders need to better their social capital.",

The most effective infection prevention and control interventions for neonates in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are unknown.\r\n\r\nAIM\r\n\r\nTo identify effective interventions in the prevention of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections in LMIC neonatal units.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nMedline, PUBMED, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE and PsychInfo (January 2003 to October 2020) were searched to identify studies reporting single or bundled interventions for prevention of bloodstream infections in LMIC neonatal units.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOur initial search identified 5206 articles; following application of filters, 27 publications met the inclusion and Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs assessment criteria and were summarized in the final analysis. No studies were carried out in low-income countries, only 1 in Sub-Saharan Africa and just 2 in multiple countries. Of the 18 single-intervention studies, most targeted skin (n = 4) and gastrointestinal mucosal integrity (n = 5). Whereas emollient therapy and lactoferrin achieved significant reductions in proven neonatal infection, glutamine and mixed probiotics showed no benefit. Chlorhexidine gluconate for cord care and kangaroo mother care reduced infection in individual single-center studies. Of the 9 studies evaluating bundles, most focused on prevention of device-associated infections and achieved significant reductions in catheter- and ventilator-associated infections.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThere is a limited evidence base for the effectiveness of infection prevention and control interventions in LMIC neonatal units; bundled interventions targeting device-associated infections were most effective. More multisite studies with robust study designs are needed to inform infection prevention and control intervention strategies in low-resource neonatal units.",

We aimed to validate the prognostic value of LSM in a large cohort study.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWe performed an international, multicentre, retrospective follow-up study of 3,985 patients with PBC seen at 23 centres in 12 countries. Eligibility criteria included at least 1 reliable LSM by VCTE and a follow-up \u2265 1 year. Independent derivation (n\u00a0= 2,740) and validation (n\u00a0= 568) cohorts were built. The primary endpoint was time to poor clinical outcomes defined as liver-related complications, liver transplantation, or death. Hazard ratios (HRs) with CIs were determined using a time-dependent multivariable Cox regression analysis.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nLSM was independently associated with poor clinical outcomes in the derivation (5,324 LSMs, mean follow-up 5.0 \u00b1 3.1 years) and validation (1,470 LSMs, mean follow-up 5.0 \u00b1 2.8 years) cohorts: adjusted HRs (95% CI) per additional kPa were 1.040 (1.026-1.054) and 1.042 (1.029-1.056), respectively (p <0.0001 for both). Adjusted C-statistics (95% CI) at baseline were 0.83 (0.79-0.87) and 0.92 (0.89-0.95), respectively. Between 5 and 30\u00a0kPa, the log-HR increased as a monotonic function of LSM. The predictive value of LSM was stable in time. LSM improved the prognostic ability of biochemical response criteria, fibrosis scores, and prognostic scores. The 8\u00a0kPa and 15\u00a0kPa cut-offs optimally separated low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. Forty percent of patients were at medium to high risk according to LSM.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nLSM by VCTE is a major, independent, validated predictor of PBC outcome. Its value as a surrogate endpoint for clinical benefit in PBC should be considered.\r\n\r\nLAY SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPrimary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune disease, wherein the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the bile ducts. PBC progresses gradually, so surrogate markers (markers that predict clinically relevant outcomes like the need for a transplant or death long before the event occurs) are often needed to expedite the drug development and approval process. Herein, we show that liver stiffness measurement is a strong predictor of clinical outcomes and could be a useful surrogate endpoint in PBC trials.",

Emerging evidence suggests a key role for epigenetics in the maturation and regulation of the immune system in health and disease. The study aimed to investigate epigenetic changes in early life and to understand the relationship between the epigenome and antigen-specific antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccination.\r\n\r\nMethods: The epigenetic profiles from 24 healthy children were analyzed at 12 months prior to a booster dose of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13), and at 24 months of age, using the Illumina Methylation 450 K assay and assessed for differences over time and between high and low vaccine responders.\r\n\r\nResults: Our analysis revealed 721 significantly differentially methylated positions between 12 and 24 months (FDR < 0.01), with significant enrichment in pathways involved in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion and T cell activation. Comparing high and low vaccine responders, we identified differentially methylated CpG sites (P value < 0.01) associated with HLA-DPB1 and IL6.\r\n\r\nConclusion: These data imply that epigenetic changes that occur during early childhood may be associated with antigen-specific antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccines.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Childhood; DNA methylation; Epigenetics; Immune system; Pneumococcal vaccination; Vaccine response.",

Following this report, we implemented a protocol to investigate children with IPD, to assess the proportion with an immunodeficiency in our setting.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\nWe retrospectively identified patients who presented with IPD from January 2015 to November 2020 and collected data from medical records. Immunological investigations included complement C3 and C4 levels, classical and alternative pathway complement function, IgG, IgA and IgM levels, specific IgG levels (H. influenza B, tetanus and pneumococcal serotypes), peripheral blood film, lymphocyte subsets, and CD62L-shedding upon activation with Toll-like receptor-agonists in selected cases.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nWe identified a total of 68 children with IPD, with a mortality of 6%. Immunological investigations were performed in 51 children. Four children (8%) had abnormal findings that were deemed of clinical significance. Two children had complement deficiencies (Factor I and C2 deficiency), one child had specific antibody deficiency, and another child had low IgM, low NK-cells and poor persistence of serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal IgG concentrations. Of the 17 children with IPD who were not tested for immunodeficiencies, 4 died and four had possible explanations for the infection.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nWe identified clinically relevant abnormal immunological findings in 4/51 (8%) of children with IPD. Our results support the recommendation to perform immunological investigations in children with IPD, since this might reveal underlying immunodeficiencies, allowing for necessary preventive measures and close follow-up.",

Acute kidney injury developing on the battlefield, in field hospitals or in higher-level hospital settings is characterized by poor outcomes. People with chronic kidney disease may experience treatment interruptions, contributing to worsening kidney function. Patients living on dialysis or with a functioning graft may experience limitations of dialysis possibilities or availability of immunosuppressive medications, increasing the risk of severe complications including death. When patients must flee, these threats are compounded by unhealthy and insecure conditions both during displacement and/or at destination. Measures to attenuate these risks may only be partially effective. Local preparedness for overall and medical/kidney-related disaster response is essential. Due to limitations in supply, adjustments in dialysis frequency or dose, switching between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and changes in immunosuppressive regimens may be required. Telemedicine (if possible) may be useful to support inexperienced local physicians in managing medical and logistical challenges. Limited treatment possibilities during warfare may necessitate referral of patients to distant higher-level hospitals, once urgent care has been initiated. Preparation for disasters should occur ahead of time. Inclusion of disaster nephrology in medical and nursing curricula and training of patients, families and others on self-care and medical practice in austere settings may enhance awareness and preparedness, support best practices adapted to the demanding circumstances, and prepare non-professionals to lend support.",

Globally, chronic kidney disease is more prevalent among women, but the prevalence of end-stage kidney failure, and especially receipt of kidney replacement therapy, is higher in men. These differences likely reflect a combination of physiological and social/structural risk factors that independently modulate kidney disease and/or its progression. The distribution of the most common risk factors such as hypertension and obesity differ between men and women and may impact disease risk differentially. Social and structural gender-related inequities remain stark across the globe. More women live in poverty, receive less education, and are more dependent on others for health care decision making, but men may have a higher risk of injury, occupational exposures, and less access to screening, prevention, and primary care. In this article, we explore how social determinants of health affect kidney disease risk and access to care differentially across genders, and differently across the globe. We also describe specific challenges experienced by boys and girls with kidney disease, how culture and geography may impact kidney care in places where resources are particularly limited such as sub-Saharan Africa, and give examples of social and structural circumstances that place young men and women at high risk of kidney disease in Mexico and Central America, illustrated by case vignettes. The coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic has raised awareness of pervasive gender-based inequities within all societies. This applies to kidney disease and is not new. The nephrology community must add its voice to the calls for action, for a more just society overall, and for the recognition of the roles of sex and gender as modulators of kidney disease risk and access to care.",

Dialysis is not considered cost-effective, and for those patients accessing the limited service available, high out-of-pocket expenses are common and few continue care over time. This study assessed challenges faced by nephrologists in SSA who manage patients needing dialysis. The specific focus was to investigate if and how physicians respond to bedside rationing situations.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nA survey was conducted among a randomly selected group of nephrologists from SSA. The questionnaire was based on a previously validated survey instrument. A descriptive and narrative approach was used for analysis.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nAmong 40 respondents, the majority saw patients weekly with acute kidney injury (AKI) or end-stage kidney failure (ESKF) in need of dialysis whom they could not dialyze. When dialysis was provided, clinical compromises were common, and 66% of nephrologists reported lack of basic diagnostics and medication and\u2009>\u200980% reported high out-of-pocket expenses for patients. Several patient-, disease- and institutional factors influenced who got access to dialysis. Patients' financial constraints and poor chances of survival limited the likelihood of receiving dialysis (reported by 79 and 78% of nephrologists respectively), while a patient's being the family bread-winner increased the likelihood (reported by 56%). Patient and institutional constraints resulted in most nephrologists (88%) frequently having to make difficult choices, sometimes having to choose between patients. Few reported existence of priority setting guidelines. Most nephrologists (74%) always, often or sometimes felt burdened by ethical dilemmas and worried about patients out of hospital hours. As a consequence, almost 46% of nephrologists reported frequently regretting their choice of profession and 26% had considered leaving the country.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nNephrologists in SSA face harsh priority setting at the bedside without available guidance. The moral distress is high. While publicly funded dialysis treatment might not be prioritized in essential health care packages on the path to universal health coverage, the suffering of the patients, families and the providers must be acknowledged and addressed to increase fairness in these decisions.",

Due to different disease manifestations, the triage of patients at high risk for a poor outcome continues to be a major challenge for clinicians. The AIFELL score was developed as a simple decision instrument for emergency rooms to distinguish COVID-19 patients in severe disease stages from less severe COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the AIFELL score as a prediction tool for clinical deterioration and disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. During the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, we analyzed consecutively hospitalized patients at the Triemli Hospital Zurich from the end of November 2020 until mid-February 2021. Statistical analyses were performed for group comparisons and to evaluate significance. AIFELL scores of patients developing severe COVID-19 stages IIb and III during hospitalization were significantly higher upon admission compared to those patients not surpassing stages I and IIa. Group comparisons indicated significantly different AIFELL scores between each stage. In conclusion, the AIFELL score at admission was useful to predict the disease severity and progression in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",

Research Question: This study's aim was a first testing of 2 models to identify patients early after kidney transplantation who are at risk for weight gain and increase in adipose tissue mass in the first year after kidney transplantation. Design: The literature-based models were evaluated on longitudinal data of 88, respectively 79 kidney transplant recipients via ordinary and Firth regression, using gains \u2265 5% in weight and adipose tissue mass respectively as primary and secondary endpoints. Results: The models included physical activity, smoking cessation at time of kidney transplantation, self-reported health status, depressive symptomatology, gender, age, education, baseline body mass index and baseline trunk fat as predictors. Area under the curve was 0.797 (95%-CI 0.702 to 0.893) for the weight model and 0.767 (95%-CI 0.656 to 0.878) for the adipose tissue mass model-showing good, respectively fair discriminative ability. For weight gain \u2265 5%, main risk factors were smoking cessation at time of transplantation (OR 16.425, 95%-CI 1.737-155.288) and better self-reported baseline health state (OR 1.068 for each 1-unit increase, 95%-CI 1.012-1.128). For the adipose tissue mass gain \u2265 5%, main risk factor was overweight/obesity (BMI \u2265 25) at baseline (odds ratio 7.659, 95%-CI 1.789-32.789). Conclusions: The models have potential to assess patients' risk for weight or adipose tissue mass gain during the year after transplantation, but further testing is needed before implementation in clinical practice.\r\n\r\nKeywords: addictive; behavior; cardiovascular disease; clinical outcomes; depression; exercise outcomes; nutrition; performance improvement; quality; quality of life; quantitative methods; regression; research.",

However, the high heterogeneity of human tumor-associated stromal cells (TASCs) hampers a clear identification of specific markers of prognostic relevance. To address these issues, we established short-term cultures of TASCs and matched healthy mucosa-associated stromal cells (MASCs) from human primary colon cancers and, upon characterization of their phenotypic and functional profiles in vitro and in vivo, we identified differentially expressed markers by proteomic analysis and evaluated their prognostic significance. TASCs were characterized by higher proliferation and differentiation potential, and enhanced expression of mesenchymal stem cell markers, as compared to MASCs. TASC triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells in vitro and promoted their metastatic spread in vivo, as assessed in an orthotopic mouse model. Proteomic analysis of matched TASCs and MASCs identified a panel of markers preferentially expressed in TASCs. The expression of genes encoding two of them, calponin 1 (CNN1) and tropomyosin beta chain isoform 2 (TPM2), was significantly associated with poor outcome in independent databases and outperformed the prognostic significance of currently proposed TASC markers. The newly identified markers may improve prognostication of primary colon cancers and identification of patients at risk.",

Moreover, such workplace experiences are considered to have negative impacts and particularly adverse health consequences on health care workers. Nevertheless, the problem is still highly underreported and thus largely ignored and unexplored in Switzerland as comprehensive data and studies on their prevalence and health correlates among hospital staffs and health professionals are widely missing.\r\n\r\nMethods: This cross-sectional study was based on secondary data from a company survey among several public hospitals and rehabilitation clinics in German-speaking Switzerland conducted in 2015/16. The study population was limited to a subsample of 1567 health professionals among the surveyed staffs of five participating hospitals and clinics. Relative frequencies of different forms of violence and discrimination at work and the total number of such experiences were calculated for the entire study population and for occupational subgroups. These data were compared with a nationally representative subsample of the Swiss Health Survey 2017 as a reference population. Multiple logistic regression analyses were further computed to investigate the association between the number of different experienced forms of violence and/or discrimination at work and several poor general and mental health outcomes.\r\n\r\nResults: 23% of the inverviewed hospital employees experienced at least one form of discrimination or violence at work in the past year, compared to 18% of the general working population. Nurses were by far the most affected occupational group regarding all forms of violence. More and particularly the most exposed and affected hospital employees with regard to experiences of violence and/or discrimination at work showed almost consistently increased frequencies and relative risks for the studied poor mental and general health outcomes. Prevalence rates and odds ratios for strong sleep disorders, strong stress feelings and increased burnout symptoms were between 3 and 4 times higher among the most exposed compared to the non-exposed group of hospital employees.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Study findings underline the importance of an active combat against violent and discriminatory behaviors in health care. Prevention strategies should particularly focus on nurses and midwives, which turned out to be the most affected and exposed group of all health professions.\r\n\r\nKeywords: General health; Hospital employees; Mental health; Workplace discrimination; Workplace violence.",

However, in Switzerland research addressing over-indebtedness is widely lacking, strongly needed and particularly important because it is evidently a rising but still commonly tabooed, socially \u201cundesired\u201d and highly stigmatized phenomenon that is rarely discussed and largely ignored and unexplored.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted among over-indebted adults seeking advice from one of the four official debt advisory centers in the Canton of Zurich. The survey finally included 219 respondents participating voluntarily and anonymously. This sample was then linked with a comparable subsample of the nationally representative Swiss Health Survey of 2017, namely 1,997 respondents of the same age from the Canton of Zurich. For reasons of comparability identical health questions and measures were taken from the Swiss Health Survey and used in the over-indebtedness survey. The pooled or combined dataset covered a total of 2,216 adult individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\nRemarkably high prevalence rates and relative risks of poor self-rated health, severe musculoskeletal and sleep disorders and moderate to severe depression were observed among over-indebted individuals compared to the general population. More than 50% of the over-indebted individuals had poor general health or moderate to severe depression compared to the general population with 14% and 7%, respectively. And far above one third of the over-indebted but \u2018only\u2019 between 6% and 8% of the general population showed severe musculoskeletal disorders and sleep disorders. Even after adjustment for various control variables and covariates, over-indebtedness increased the odds ratios for poor health outcomes consistently and dramatically, i.e. by a factor of 8 and more (aOR = 8.5\u201311.6).\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nOver-indebtedness in Switzerland has particularly negative effects on various aspects of the health of the persons concerned, irrespective of their demographic characteristics and their social and employment status.",

The study population (n = 219) was compared to the cantonal subsample of the general adult population selected from the nationally representative sample of the Swiss Health Survey 2017 (n = 1,997). Bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to examine associations between over-indebtedness, mastery and health outcomes like mental stress and depression.\r\n\r\nResults: Over-indebted people have poorer mental health and weaker mastery than the general population. Low mastery is the strongest predictor of poor mental health (beta coefficient = 0.58/-0.62 for mental stress/depression respectively) among the over-indebted, followed by the perception of one's health being affected by over-indebtedness (beta coefficient = -0.19/0.15). The amount of debt, anticipated time until repayment of debt and duration of indebtedness had no predictive effects.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Surprisingly, traditional debt parameters cannot explain the poor mental health of the over-indebted, in contrast to a strong sense of mastery, which was identified as a highly protective factor.",

Biological characteristics of modern humans are a result of the process of auto-domestication that is continuing. Thus, they include disadvantages occurring in domesticated species: poor ability to cope with the external environment, reduced central nervous system plagued by mental abnormalities, gastrointestinal and metabolic deficiencies including reduced dentition, and musculoskeletal limitations. Since the process of autodomestication is continuing, these disadvantages will increase in future generations. At this stage of our bio-cultural evolution, we are being confronted by a pandemic of mental disorders which we are ill-equipped to address. This paper briefly discusses reasons why modern humans are more susceptible to mental disorders due to auto-domestication.",

However, the mechanism of cascading hazards that cause small outbursts to transition into big disasters is poorly understood. We investigated the Gongbatongshaco GLOF in the Himalayas, to reveal a novel disaster model and mechanism, considering increasing regional temperature, glacial lake area, and glacial retreat. Global warming drives glacial retreat, and uncover loose sediment that can be mobilized as debris flows, triggering small glacial lake outbursts in high mountain regions. Sediment generated from earthquake-induced landslides exacerbates the flow magnitude in a valley to increase the disaster risk. Concentrations of inhabitants located in these areas are subject to socioeconomic vulnerability, leading to post-disaster poverty within these communities. A reasonable GLOFs resilient mitigation framework is proposed. The results offer new insights into risk assessment, especially for small glacial lakes in tectonically-active high mountain environments influenced by climate change and earthquake activity.",

Medical accounts on caring for young people with variations of sex characteristics\nAbstract: Objectives:\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of intersex or variations of sex characteristics (VSC) often has a big impact on families who fear social stigmatization. Research has shown that intersex populations often experience important health disparities and that poor mental health and daily function are common among youth with VSC. The present study aimed to explore what healthcare professionals of adolescents and young adults (AYA) with VSC find important in terms of care to this group of patients.\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with Swiss healthcare providers involved in the care of youth born with an intersex variation. The qualitative data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.\r\nResults:\r\n\r\nAnalysis resulted in six major themes: (1) With regard to patients\u2019 and families lived experiences, interviewees reported that fertility was as a major issue for parents but not for intersex youth as they were said to live in the moment. (2) Respondents considered various forms of psycho-social care (professional support, peer support and informal support from family and friends) to be of fundamental importance for their patients, but many of them seemed critical about support from advocacy groups and activists. All healthcare providers reported significant gaps in (3) the transition process and (4) the establishment of multidisciplinary care teams due to structural, provider- and patient-related barriers. (5) Participants were in favor of a more holistic and patient-centred care approach and (6) were critical about the medicalized use of DSD (disorder of sex development) with patients and families.\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nThese findings suggest that although clinicians work hard to implement a holistic approach to care, their intentions are often undercut by a desire to hold a position of medical control.

Understanding the neutralizing activity and coverage of SARS-CoV-2 variants of vaccine-elicited antibodies is required to guide prophylactic and therapeutic COVID-19 interventions in this frail population. By analyzing plasma samples from 130 hemodialysis and 13 peritoneal dialysis patients after two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines, we found that 35% of the patients had low-level or undetectable IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S). Neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 and Delta variant were low or undetectable in 49% and 77% of patients, respectively, and were further reduced against other emerging variants. The fraction of non-responding patients was higher in SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve hemodialysis patients immunized with BNT162b2 (66%) than those immunized with mRNA-1273 (23%). The reduced neutralizing activity correlated with low antibody avidity. Patients followed up to 7 months after vaccination showed a rapid decay of the antibody response with an average 21- and 10-fold reduction of neutralizing antibodies to vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 and Delta variant, which increased the fraction of non-responders to 84% and 90%, respectively. These data indicate that dialysis patients should be prioritized for additional vaccination boosts. Nevertheless, their antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 must be continuously monitored to adopt the best prophylactic and therapeutic strategy.",

However, the compliance, how much an HO is worn after it has been prescribed, is widely unknown.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE\r\n\r\nThis study was performed to assess the wearing time of HOs for OVFs in a prospective blinded, sensor-controlled manner.\r\n\r\nSTUDY DESIGN / SETTING\r\n\r\nA prospective, single blinded observational study was performed.\r\n\r\nPATIENT SAMPLE\r\n\r\nThis study prospectively included 18 patients who were treated non-operatively with an HO for OVFs.\r\n\r\nOUTCOME MEASURES\r\n\r\nThe true wearing time was measured using a hidden temperature-based sensor. The patients were invited to return for regular follow-up every 2 weeks for 6 weeks, at which time clinical evaluation (including a visual analog scale for pain and the Oswestry disability questionnaire) and radiographs of the spine were performed.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nFull compliance was defined as a wearing time of 15 hours per day. Correlation between compliance and demographic differences, patient reported outcomes and radiographic changes of the vertebral structures were calculated.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe mean HO wearing time was 5.5\u00b13.3 hours (37%\u00b122% compliance). Female patients used the HO significantly longer per day than did male patients (6.5\u00b13.2 vs 2.9\u00b12.0 hours, p=.039). Age and body mass index had no influence on wearing behavior.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nOverall, compliance with wearing HOs is poor and shows great variability with significant gender-dependency but not associated with BMI, age, or pain-level. Further studies are required to confirm our results that the wearing time does not have an influence on kyphotic progression of the osteoporotic fractured segment, nor on clinical outcome at short term.\r\n\r\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\r\n\r\nI.",

Although eating habits are one of the main predictors of physical health, few studies assess the nutritional status and eating behavior of people with SMI. The aim of this study was to examine the nutritional status and risk of malnutrition in people with SMI who were in need of intensive psychiatric treatment. The cross-sectional study included 65 inpatients and 67 outpatients with psychotic or depressive disorders from the Psychiatric Hospital of the University of Zurich. Patients\u2019 assessments at admission included anthropometric measurements, such as weight and height, and interview data including severity of symptoms and functioning (SCL-K-9, PHQ-D, CGI, m-GAF), personal and medical data, nutrition risk screening tools (adapted NRS, MNA-SF), and laboratory values. The results showed that 32% of the inpatients and 34% of the outpatients were at risk of malnutrition, which was associated with higher levels of psychiatric symptoms and lower levels of functioning. Regardless, the body mass index (BMI) was overweight in both groups (mean BMIinpatients = 25.3, mean BMIoutpatients = 27.9). These results indicate that a substantial proportion of psychiatric patients seems to be at risk of malnutrition, despite most being overweight, and hence they might benefit from nutritional support during their psychiatric treatment. Moreover, nutritional risk screening tools specifically developed for the mental healthcare setting are needed.",

Data regarding pessimism, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and mortality and all-cause mortality remained inconclusive. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide an overview of the association between pessimism, CVD outcomes and mortality. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted from inception through July 2022 for studies evaluating pessimism and adverse outcomes. A total of 17 studies published between 1966 and July 2022 met our inclusion criteria, for a total of 232,533 individuals. Pooled hazard ratios were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses. Based on pooled analysis of adjusted HRs, pessimism was associated with adjusted HR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.07-1.19) for all-cause mortality with minimal heterogeneity (I2 = 28.5%). Based on pooled analysis of adjusted HRs, pessimism was associated with adjusted HR of 1.30 (95% CI 0.43-3.95) for CHD mortality, adjusted HR of 1.41 (95% CI 1.05-1.91) for CVD mortality, and adjusted HR of 1.43 (95% CI 0.64-3.16) for stroke. In conclusion, pessimism seems to be significantly associated with a higher risk for and poorer outcomes from CVD events than optimistic styles. There are genetic and other bases for these life approaches, but behavioral, cognitive and meditative interventions can modify patients' level of pessimism, hopefully leading to better medical outcomes. Testing this theory would yield highly useful and practical data for clinical care.",

Most evidence suggests that Lokomat therapy is equally effective as but not superior to standard therapy approaches. One reason might be that the Lokomat parameters to personalize therapy, such as gait speed, body weight support and Guidance Force, are not optimally used. However, there is little evidence available about the influence of Lokomat parameters on the effectiveness of the therapy. Nevertheless, an appropriate reporting of the applied therapy parameters is key to the successful clinical transfer of study results. The aim of this scoping review was therefore to evaluate how the currently available clinical studies report Lokomat parameter settings and map the current literature on Lokomat therapy parameters.\r\n\r\nMethods and results: A systematic literature search was performed in three databases: Pubmed, Scopus and Embase. All primary research articles performing therapy with the Lokomat in neurologic populations in English or German were included. The quality of reporting of all clinical studies was assessed with a framework developed for this particular purpose. We identified 208 studies investigating Lokomat therapy in patients with neurologic diseases. The reporting quality was generally poor. Less than a third of the studies indicate which parameter settings have been applied. The usability of the reporting for a clinical transfer of promising results is therefore limited.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Although the currently available evidence on Lokomat parameters suggests that therapy parameters might have an influence on the effectiveness, there is currently not enough evidence available to provide detailed recommendations. Nevertheless, clinicians should pay close attention to the reported therapy parameters when translating research findings to their own clinical practice. To this end, we propose that the quality of reporting should be improved and we provide a reporting framework for authors as a quality control before submitting a Lokomat-related article.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Body weight support; Gait speed; Lokomat; Neurological rehabilitation; Public Reporting of Healthcare Data; Robotic guidance.",

        "document": "Title: The individual welfare concerns for small cetaceans from two bycatch mitigation techniques\nAbstract: The prevalence of small cetacean (including dolphins, porpoises and small odontocete whales) bycatch in fisheries worldwide remains an ongoing conservation and welfare challenge. Various mitigation methods have been implemented in attempts to reduce bycatch. Two such methods involve gear modification: placement of Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) within trawl nets, usually involving a physical barrier and an escape hatch; and, deployment of Acoustic Deterrent Devices (ADDs, \u2018pingers\u2019), typically placed on static nets and some trawl nets, to alert cetaceans to their presence and deter them from interacting with the gear. Despite their efficacy in reducing bycatch under certain circumstances, negative welfare impacts remain for individuals interacting with both BRDs and ADDs. Post-mortem analyses of small cetaceans caught in trawl gear, for example, illustrate the potential long-term effects of capture myopathies and cardiac damage sustained during the acute stress of entanglement, prior to and during escape through the BRD. Further, animals may become entangled in the bars, ropes or mesh of the BRD or escape hatch itself, and little is known of their post-release survival. ADD efficacy is typically fishery- and cetacean species-specific and, even where deemed a success at reducing bycatch, displacing animals from their optimal foraging habitat could negatively impact individual survival. Some species display equivocal responses to ADDs, while others may habituate to or be attracted to the sounds produced as they learn to associate it with food rewards, as they do in trawl fisheries, thereby reducing ADD efficacy and increasing the likelihood of entanglement. Here, we provide a synthesis of existing studies of these mitigation methods and discuss the associated welfare issues, where poor welfare negatively impacts an individual\u2019s physical or mental state. We conclude that cetacean welfare considerations should become an integral part of decision-making in relation to bycatch globally.",

However, the relative importance of plaque location regarding the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with non-obstructive CAD has not been well defined.\r\n\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\r\n\r\nFrom the Coronary CT Angiography Evaluation for Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter (CONFIRM) registry, 4644 patients without obstructive CAD were included in this study. The degree of stenosis was classified as 0 (no) and 1-49% (non-obstructive). Proximal involvement was defined as any plaque present in the left main or the proximal segment of the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery. Extensive CAD was defined as segment involvement score of >4. During a median follow-up of 5.2 years (interquartile range 4.1-6.0), 340 (7.3%) MACE occurred. Within the non-obstructive CAD group (n = 2065), proximal involvement was observed in 1767 (85.6%) cases. When compared to non-obstructive CAD patients without proximal involvement, those with proximal involvement had an increased MACE risk (log-rank P = 0.033). Multivariate Cox analysis showed when compared to patients with no CAD, proximal non-obstructive CAD was associated with increased MACE risk [hazard ratio (HR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-2.45, P < 0.001] after adjusting for extensive CAD and conventional cardiovascular risk factors; however, non-proximal non-obstructive CAD did not increase MACE risk (HR 1.26, 95% CI 0.79-2.01, P = 0.339).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nIndependent of plaque extent, proximal coronary involvement was associated with increased MACE risk in patients with non-obstructive CAD. The plaque location information by coronary computed tomography angiography may provide additional risk prediction over CAD extent in patients with non-obstructive CAD.",

Less is known about the relationship between the combination of these restrictions with Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), PA, mental health, and sleep-quality. The present study aimed to evaluate whether COVID-19 restrictions and RIF during the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran are associated with poor PA, anxiety, well-being, and sleep-quality outcomes. A total of 510 individuals participated in an online questionnaire that was disseminated to adults (\u226518 years) residing in Iran from 13 May 2021 to 16 May 2021 (~3 days), just after the end of Ramadan 2021. PA behavior (Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), well-being (Mental Health Continuum-Short Form), and sleep-quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). Of 510 individuals included in the study (331 female (64.9%); mean \u00b1 SD, 31 \u00b1 12 years), 172 (33.7%) reported less PA during the Ramadan 2021. PA was associated with better well-being and sleep-quality outcomes. Regardless of PA, participants who fasted for all of Ramadan had less anxiety and better well-being outcomes than those who fasted part of Ramadan or did not fast at all. However, the fasting part of Ramadan decreased the sleep-quality of active participants. The Ramadan 2021 was associated with poor PA, well-being, and sleep-quality of Iranians. However, PA was associated with better well-being and sleep-quality outcomes, and those who fasted all Ramadan had better anxiety and well-being outcomes. Therefore, PA during Ramadan might be an essential and scalable mental health resilience builder during COVID-19 restrictions which should be encouraged.\r\n\r\nKeywords: SARS-CoV-2; exercise training; feasting; holy month; lockdown; mental health; sleep-quality.",

The option of working more hours a day and, as a result, increasing the remuneration received is often chosen by drivers even at the expense of sleep. Due to their professional obligation, this population is at risk of excessive sleepiness due to sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality, increasing the risk of detrimental effects on health and the risk of car accidents.

Our aim was to compare levels of cognition, psychosocial functioning, and health-related QoL of CC survivors to healthy controls and examine the associations between these three domains. Seventy-eight CC survivors (age range = 7-16 years, \u2265 one year since cancer treatment) and 56 healthy controls were included. Cognition (i.e., fluid intelligence, executive functions, memory, processing speed, and selective attention), psychosocial functioning, and health-related QoL were assessed using standardized tests and questionnaires. The cognitive performance, parent-reported psychosocial behaviour, and health-related QoL of the CC survivors were within the normative range. However, working memory was significantly poorer in survivors than controls, and visuospatial working memory below the normative range was more commonly observed among survivors than among controls. Processing speed significantly predicted survivors' performance in executive functions. Among survivors, greater peer problems were significantly associated with poorer cognitive functions and health-related QoL. Despite the evidence for good intellectual functioning, which might point towards adequate reserves, in some survivors, domain-specific difficulties may emerge years after cancer relating to psychosocial development and QoL.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Cognitive late effects; Cognitive reserve; Executive functions; Pediatric cancer survivors; Psychosocial functioning.",

Unfortunately, CR is still underutilized, especially among women and older patients. Aim of this study was to highlight age- and sex-specific effects of inpatient CR on HRQOL.\r\n\r\nMethods: From 2012 to 2018, 18,459 patients were prospectively assessed in six Swiss CR clinics. Of these, we retrospectively analyzed a final sample of 8'286 patients with a mean (SD) age of 67.8 (11.3) in men and 72.2 (11.3) in women. HRQOL was measured at CR entry and discharge. In multivariable analyses, sex- and age- specific changes in HRQOL throughout CR were estimated, adjusting for baseline HRQOL and clinical characteristics.\r\n\r\nResults: Participants of both sexes improved significantly (p <.001) in all domains of HRQOL during CR. Women reported significantly lower social (p < .001) and emotional (p < .001) HRQOL than men at CR entry. Female sex predicted greater improvement in social (F 19.63, p < .001), emotional (F = 27.814, p < .001) and physical HRQOL (F = 20.473, p < .001). In a subgroup of n= 2'632 elderly patients (> 75 years) female sex predicted greater changes in emotional (F = 15.738, p < .001) and physical (F = 6.295, p = .012), but not in social HRQOL.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Women report poorer HRQOL at CR entry compared to men, but in turn particularly benefit from CR in this regard. Our results indicate that sex- and age-specific needs of patients should be considered.\r\n\r\nKeywords: HRQOL; age; cardiac rehabilitation; sex",

Novel risk stratification parameters include Group 3/4 (non-WNT/non-SHH) methylation subgroups I-VIII or whole-chromosomal aberration (WCA) phenotypes. This study investigates the integration of clinical and molecular parameters to improve risk stratification of non-WNT/non-SHH MB. Non-WNT/non-SHH MB from the HIT2000 study and the HIT-MED registries were selected based on availability of DNA-methylation profiling data. MYC or MYCN amplification and WCA of chromosomes 7, 8, and 11 were inferred from methylation array-based copy number profiles. In total, 403 non-WNT/non-SHH MB were identified, 346/403 (86%) had a methylation class family Group 3/4 methylation score (classifier v11b6)\u2009\u2265\u20090.9, and 294/346 (73%) were included in the risk stratification modeling based on Group 3 or 4 score (v11b6)\u2009\u2265\u20090.8 and subgroup I-VIII score (mb_g34)\u2009\u2265\u20090.8. Group 3\u00a0MB (5y-PFS, survival estimation\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation: 41.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6%; 5y-OS: 48.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0%) showed poorer survival compared to Group 4 (5y-PFS: 68.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7%; 5y-OS: 84.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8%). Subgroups II (5y-PFS: 27.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2%) and III (5y-PFS: 37.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9%) showed the poorest and subgroup VI (5y-PFS: 76.6\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9%), VII (5y-PFS: 75.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2%), and VIII (5y-PFS: 66.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8%) the best survival. Multivariate analysis revealed subgroup in combination with WCA phenotype to best predict risk of progression and death. The integration of clinical (age, M and R status) and molecular (MYC/N, subgroup, WCA phenotype) variables identified a low-risk stratum with a 5y-PFS of 94\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7 and a very high-risk stratum with a 5y-PFS of 29\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1%.

This study aimed to evaluate the attitudes of General Dental Practitioners (GDPs), working in Switzerland, to caring for dependent older adults with a focus on the use of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) as a caries preventive agent and more widely on the provision of domiciliary dental care (DDC).\r\nMETHODS\r\nSeventeen GDPs working in Switzerland were interviewed. Each interview was semi-structured by a topic guide, digitally recorded, and transcribed. The transcribed data were analysed using a thematic analysis.\r\nRESULTS\r\nThree major themes to the widespread use of SDF in this population were identified: lack of basic knowledge including indications for use; aesthetic concerns and product availability. Those who had knowledge about the product believed that using it in the treatment of frail older adults had advantages, especially in the preservation and/or prolongation of the life of teeth without invasive treatments. The biggest barrier was its availability. The GDPs identified three major barriers related to DDC provision: lack of infrastructure, poor financial rewards and safety concerns (patient and operator safety). Those who provided this service stated that they were doing it because of self-motivation, kindness, or as a role in community service.\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nThe potential use of SDF was viewed positively by the majority of the GDPs interviewed but confusion exists over its availability in Switzerland, and other barriers were identified to more widespread use in this patient group. The GDPs interviewed in this study reported that a lack of infrastructure and a low level of remuneration continue to be barriers to more of them undertaking DDC for dependent older adults.",

        "document": "Title: Periodontitis and peri-implantitis in elderly people experiencing institutional and hospital confinement\nAbstract: An increasing number of elderly people retain their natural teeth into old age and further, the prevalence of endosseous implants for supporting oral prosthesis is ever increasing. These teeth and implants now present a considerable challenge in terms of maintenance, especially when patients become dependent on care. Periodontal and peri-implant diseases are more prevalent in elderly than in younger age cohorts. There are distinct differences related to the inflammatory response between periodontal and peri-implant tissues, both in young and old age. The age-related reasons for the increase in periodontal infections may be related to poor oral hygiene because of a loss of dexterity or vision, but also to immunosenescence. This term describes the aging of the immune system and the decline of its effectiveness with age. Low-grade infections, like chronic periodontitis, may cause low-grade inflammation and subsequently increase the likelihood of developing chronic diseases. In return, treatment of periodontitis may improve general health, as demonstrated for diabetes. A second mechanism illustrating how poor oral health translates into systemic disease is the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. The treatment options in old age should be evaluated with regard to the issues of general health and maintenance. Systematic periodontal maintenance therapy, as performed in younger age cohorts, may be difficult to implement in elderly people experiencing institutional or hospital confinement because of logistics, barriers related to patients and caregivers, or cost. The scale of periodontal disease in old age represents a public health issue.",

Type I interferons (IFN) are involved in immune responses to viral infection and exhibit anti-tumor activity in certain cancers. Here we explored the biological relevance of constitutive type I IFN signaling in murine glioma models in vitro and in vivo. CT-2A, GL-261, SMA-497, SMA-540 and SMA-560 murine glioma cells expressed IFN type I receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 and were responsive to exogenous IFN stimulation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of IFNAR1 decreased the baseline expression of type I IFN response genes in GL-261 cells, but neither in CT-2A nor in SMA-560 cells. IFNAR1 deletion slowed growth in GL-261 and SMA-560, but not in CT-2A cells. However, only the growth of IFNAR1-depleted GL-261 tumors and not that of SMA-560 tumors was delayed in vivo upon orthotopic tumor cell implantation into syngeneic mice. This survival gain was no longer detected when the IFNAR1-depleted GL-261 cells were inoculated into IFNAR1-deficient mice. Altogether these data suggest that constitutive type I IFN signaling in gliomas may be pro-tumorigenic, but only in a microenvironment that is proficient for type I IFN signaling in the host.",

The aim of this paper was to review the literature on the relationship between smoking and alcohol consumption with regard to RMD-specific outcomes.\r\n\r\nMethods: Two systematic reviews were conducted to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published between 2013 and 2018, related to smoking and alcohol consumption in seven RMDs: osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus, axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), systemic sclerosis (SSc) and gout. Two additional systematic reviews were performed to identify original longitudinal studies on smoking and alcohol consumption and disease-specific outcomes.\r\n\r\nResults: Nine reviews and 65 original studies on smoking as well as two reviews and 14 original studies on alcohol consumption met the inclusion criteria. While most studies were moderate/poor quality, smoking was significantly associated with poorer outcomes: cardiovascular comorbidity; poorer response to RA treatment; higher disease activity and severity in early RA; axSpA radiographic progression. Results were heterogeneous for OA while there was limited evidence for PsA, SSc and gout. Available studies on alcohol mainly focused on RA, reporting a positive association between alcohol intake and radiographic progression. Five studies assessed alcohol consumption in gout, reporting a significant association between the number and type of alcoholic beverages and the occurrence of flares.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Current literature supports that smoking has a negative impact on several RMD-specific outcomes and that moderate or high alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of flares in RA and gout.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Epidemiology; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Smoking",

Over time, the share of automation innovations endogenously increases through an increase in low-skill wages, leading to an increase in the skill premium and a decline in the labor share. We calibrate the model to the US economy and show that it quantitatively replicates the paths of the skill premium, the labor share, and labor productivity. Our model offers a new perspective on recent trends in the income distribution by showing that they can be explained endogenously.",

We investigated electroclinical endophenotypes and long-term seizure outcome in a large cohort of patients with EMA.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nIn this multicenter retrospective study, patients with EMA with \u22655 years of follow-up were included. We investigated prognostic patterns and sustained terminal remission (STR), along with their prognostic factors. Moreover, a 2-step cluster analysis was used to investigate the presence of distinct EMA endophenotypes.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nWe included 172 patients with a median age at onset of 7 years (interquartile range [IQR] 5-10 years) and a median follow-up duration of 14 years (IQR 8.25-23.75 years). Sixty-six patients (38.4%) displayed a nonremission pattern, whereas remission and relapse patterns were encountered in 56 (32.6%) and 50 (29.1%) participants. Early epilepsy onset, history of febrile seizures (FS), and EM status epilepticus significantly predicted a nonremission pattern according to multinomial logistic regression analysis. STR was achieved by 68 (39.5%) patients with a mean latency of 14.05 years (SD \u00b112.47 years). Early epilepsy onset, psychiatric comorbid conditions, and a history of FS and generalized tonic-clonic seizures were associated with a lower probability of achieving STR according to a Cox regression proportional hazards model. Antiseizure medication (ASM) withdrawal was attempted in 62 of 172 patients, and seizures recurred in 74.2%. Cluster analysis revealed 2 distinct clusters with 86 patients each. Cluster 2, which we defined as EMA-plus, was characterized by an earlier age at epilepsy onset, higher rate of intellectual disability, EM status epilepticus, generalized paroxysmal fast activity, self-induced seizures, FS, and poor ASM response, whereas cluster 1, the EMA-only cluster, was characterized by a higher rate of seizure remission and more favorable neuropsychiatric outcome.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nEarly epilepsy onset was the most relevant prognostic factor for poor treatment response. A long latency between epilepsy onset and ASM response was observed, suggesting the effect of age-related brain changes in EMA remission. Last, our cluster analysis showed a clear-cut distinction of patients with EMA into an EMA-plus insidious subphenotype and an EMA-only benign cluster that strongly differed in terms of remission rates and cognitive outcomes.",

However, there is a lack of benchmark data to reliably evaluate outcomes after redo-LT.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWe collected data on redo-LT between January 2010 and December 2018 from 22 high-volume transplant centers. Benchmark cases were defined as recipients with model of end stage liver disease (MELD) score \u226425, absence of portal vein thrombosis, no mechanical ventilation at the time of surgery, receiving a graft from a donor after brain death. Also, high-urgent priority and early redo-LT including those for primary nonfunction (PNF) or hepatic artery thrombosis were excluded. Benchmark cutoffs were derived from the 75th percentile of the medians of all benchmark centers.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOf 1110 redo-LT, 373 (34%) cases qualified as benchmark cases. Among these cases, the rate of postoperative complications until discharge was 76%, and increased up to 87% at 1-year, respectively. One-year overall survival rate was excellent with 90%. Benchmark cutoffs included Comprehensive Complication Index CCI \u00ae at 1-year of \u226472, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates of \u226413% and \u226415%, respectively. In contrast, patients who received a redo-LT for PNF showed worse outcomes with some values dramatically outside the redo-LT benchmarks.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThis study shows that redo-LT achieves good outcome when looking at benchmark scenarios. However, this figure changes in high-risk redo-LT, as for example in PNF. This analysis objectifies for the first-time results and efforts for redo-LT and can serve as a basis for discussion about the use of scarce resources.",

A better understanding of chromatin biology (DNA/histone complexes) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has enabled the development of epigenetic drugs able to modulate transcriptional programs implicated in cardiovascular diseases. This particularly applies to heart failure, where epigenetic networks have shown to underpin several pathological features, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and microvascular dysfunction. Targeting epigenetic signals might represent a promising approach, especially in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where prognosis remains poor and breakthrough therapies have yet to be approved. In this setting, epigenetics can be employed for the development of customized therapeutic approaches thus paving the way for personalized medicine. Even though the beneficial effects of epi-drugs are gaining attention, the number of epigenetic compounds used in the clinical practice remains low suggesting that more selective epi-drugs are needed. From DNA-methylation changes to non-coding RNAs, we can establish brand-new regulations for drug targets with the aim of restoring healthy epigenomes and transcriptional programs in the failing heart. In the present review, we bring the timeline of epi-drug discovery and development, thus highlighting the emerging role of epigenetic therapies in heart failure.",

However, clozapine protocols and package inserts worldwide provide no instructions for preventing myocarditis or pneumonia during clozapine titrations. Prescribers worldwide are largely unaware of that. Meanwhile, as they worry about agranulocytosis, their clozapine-treated patients are at risk of dying from pneumonia or myocarditis. Consequently, an international guideline with 104 authors from 50 countries/regions was recently published to provide personalised clozapine titration schedules for adult inpatients. This forum article reviews pneumonia and myocarditis occurring during clozapine titration, as well as the three most innovative aspects of this new guideline: (1) personalised titration, (2) C reactive protein (CRP) measures, and (3) dose predictions based on blood levels. Clozapine metabolism is influenced by 3 levels of complexity: (1) ancestry groups, (2) sex-smoking subgroups, and (3) presence/absence of poor metabolizer status. These 3 groups of variables should determine the maintenance dose and speed of clozapine titration; they are summarised in a table in the full-text. The international clozapine titration guideline recommends measuring CRP levels simultaneously with WBC, at baseline and weekly at least for the first 4 weeks of titration, the highest risk period for clozapine-induced myocarditis.",

We aimed to assess changes in risk stratification and outcomes of ACHD patients suffering from COVID-19 between March 2020 and April 2021.\r\n\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\r\n\r\nRisk stratification among ACHD experts (before and after the first outcome data were available) was assessed by means of questionnaires. In addition, COVID-19 cases and the corresponding patient characteristics were recorded among participating centres. Predictors for the outcome of interest (complicated disease course) were assessed by means of multivariable logistic regression models calculated with cluster-robust standard errors. When assessing the importance of general and ACHD specific risk factors for a complicated disease course, their overall importance and the corresponding risk perception among ACHD experts decreased over time. Overall, 638 patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0168 during the first wave and n\u00a0=\u00a0470 during the subsequent waves) were included (median age 34 years, 52% women). Main independent predictors for a complicated disease course were male sex, increasing age, a BMI >25\u00a0kg/m2, having \u22652 comorbidities, suffering from a cyanotic heart disease or having suffered COVID-19 in the first wave vs. subsequent waves.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nApart from cyanotic heart disease, general risk factors for poor outcome in case of COVID-19 reported in the general population are equally important among ACHD patients.

Our estimations detect that climate anomalies during gestation and early infancy induced a decrease in average height observed at adulthood, as well as an increase in height dispersion, indicating greater welfare inequalities. These results indicate that pre-Anthropocene climate shocks had irremediable welfare implications for the poorest segments of the population in lower income countries.",

We therefore assessed seroprevalence and identified risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity in this population.\r\n\r\nMethods: Between 22 June 22 and 15 August 2020, HCWs from institutions in northern/eastern Switzerland were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We recorded baseline characteristics, non-occupational and occupational risk factors. We used pairwise tests of associations and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with seropositivity.\r\n\r\nResults: Among 4664 HCWs from 23 healthcare facilities, 139 (3%) were seropositive. Non-occupational exposures independently associated with seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-positive household (adjusted OR 59, 95% CI 33-106), stay in a COVID-19 hotspot (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) and male sex (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1). Blood group 0 vs. non-0 (aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8), active smoking (aOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.7), living with children <12 years (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) and being a physician (aOR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5) were associated with decreased risk. Other occupational risk factors were close contact to COVID-19 patients (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.4), exposure to COVID-19-positive co-workers (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), poor knowledge of standard hygiene precautions (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) and frequent visits to the hospital canteen (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.8).\r\n\r\nDiscussion: Living with COVID-19-positive households showed the strongest association with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. We identified several potentially modifiable work-related risk factors, which might allow mitigation of the COVID-19 risk among HCWs. The lower risk among those living with children, even after correction for multiple confounders, is remarkable and merits further study.\r\n\r\nKeywords: COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Risk factors; Seroprevalence; Switzerland",

In rodent models, stress/trauma, poor diet, and endocrine disruptors in a parent have been shown to cause phenotypes in the direct progeny, suggesting intergenerational inheritance. A few models also examined transmission to further offspring and suggested transgenerational inheritance, but such multigenerational inheritance is not well characterized. Our previous work on a mouse model of early postnatal stress showed that behaviour and metabolism are altered in the offspring of exposed males up to the 4th generation in the patriline and up to the 2nd generation in the matriline. The present study examined if symptoms can be transmitted beyond the 4th generation in the patriline. Analyses of the 5th and 6th generations of mice revealed that altered risk-taking and glucose regulation caused by postnatal stress are still manifested in the 5th generation but are attenuated in the 6th generation. Some of the symptoms are expressed in both males and females, but some are sex-dependent and sometimes opposite. These results indicate that postnatal trauma can affect behaviour and metabolism over many generations, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms of transmission.",

Traditional real-wage indices suggest that living standards in Europe stagnated before 1800. In this paper, we argue that welfare may have actually risen substantially, but surreptitiously, because of an influx of new goods. Colonial \u201cluxuries\u201d such as tea, coffee, and sugar became highly coveted. Together with more simple household staples such as potatoes and tomatoes, overseas goods transformed European diets after the discovery of America and the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope. They became household items in many countries by the end of the 18th century. We apply two standard methods to calculate broad orders of magnitude of the resulting welfare gains. While they cannot be assessed precisely, gains from greater variety may well have been big enough to boost European real incomes by 10% or more (depending on the assumptions used).",

However, it is still unclear which patients might benefit the most from this approach. We retrospectively analyzed a multicenter cohort of 1381 patients with pTany pN1-3 cM0 R0 urothelial BCa treated with radical cystectomy (RC) with or without cisplatin-based ACT. The main endpoint was overall survival (OS) after RC. We performed 1:1 propensity score matching to adjust for baseline characteristics and conducted a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to assess postoperative risk groups and Cox regression analyses to predict OS. Overall, 391 patients (28%) received cisplatin-based ACT. After matching, two cohorts of 281 patients with pN+ BCa were obtained. CART analysis stratified patients into three risk groups: favorable prognosis (\u2264pT2 and positive lymph node [PLN] count \u22642; odds ratio [OR] 0.43), intermediate prognosis (\u2265pT3 and PLN count \u22642; OR 0.92), and poor prognosis (pTany and PLN count \u22653; OR 1.36). Only patients with poor prognosis benefitted from ACT in terms of OS (HR 0.51; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). We created the first algorithm that stratifies patients with pN+ BCa into prognostic classes and identified patients with pTany BCa with PLN \u22653 as the most suitable candidates for cisplatin-based ACT. PATIENT SUMMARY: We found that overall survival among patients with bladder cancer and evidence of lymph node involvement depends on cancer stage and the number of positive lymph nodes. Patients with more than three nodes affected by metastases seem to experience the greatest overall survival benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy after bladder removal. Our study suggests that patients with the highest risk should be prioritized for cisplatin-based chemotherapy after bladder removal.",

Multiple nomograms, grading tools and scoring systems now exist in the adult setting, which aim to enhance the pre-operative planning and decision-making associated with these surgeries. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in nomograms dedicated for use in the paediatric setting. This study provides an up-to-date review and assessment of available paediatric endourology nomograms and scoring systems.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nA comprehensive search of worldwide literature was conducted according PRISMA methodology. Studies describing paediatric-specific endourology nomograms, scoring systems or grading tools and studies externally validating these tools, or existing adult tools in a paediatric population, were evaluated and included in the narrative data synthesis.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nA total of 7 endourology nomograms were identified. 4 were paediatric-specific, 2 for shockwave lithotripsy, 1 for percutaneous nephrolithotomy or ureteroscopy and 1 for percutaneous nephrolithotomy specifically. Only the 2 shockwave lithotripsy nomograms have been externally validated in 4 further studies and showed efficacy in predicting treatment success. 3 adult tools, all specific to PCNL have been investigated and validated in a paediatric setting in 11 studies. In general, they showed efficacy in the prediction of stone free rate but were poor at predicting likelihood of complications.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nA limited number of paediatric-specific endourology predictive nomograms are available to aid in the management of kidney stone disease, with the strongest evidence supporting those designed for shockwave lithotripsy. Although 3 adult tools have been implemented, there are problems applying these to the paediatric setting and further development of paediatric-specific tools is necessary.",

Grounded in an appreciation of the quotidian, the paper explores how pandemic-related disruptions have destabilized the traditional boundaries between work and leisure, producing a blurry everyday life that combines labor with home time and, subsequently, results in confused and uncertain reactions to the challenges of prolonged lockdown. This has been exacerbated by a fragmented government response due to Swiss federalism, combined with a climate of poor communication from authorities.

Quality of life for these children has historically been poor; however, over the decades pediatric urologists have devised many creative solutions to help them live a normal life and be free of discomfort and unacceptable social sequelae. These are complex reconstructive operations including bladder augmentation or appendicostomy that require skill and experience to achieve good outcomes and avoid complications. The pediatric general surgeon may occasionally be asked to assist in these operations or might encounter a reconstructed anatomy in an emergency situation.

Many studies have sought to identify brain-based biomarkers of these clinical variables using a priori dichotomies (e.g., good vs. poor cognition, deficit vs. nondeficit syndrome).\r\n\r\nMETHODS: We evaluated a fully data-driven approach to do the same by building and validating a brain connectivity-based biomarker of social cognitive and neurocognitive performance in a sample using resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (n\u00a0= 74 healthy control participants, n\u00a0= 114 persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 188 total). We used canonical correlation analysis followed by clustering to identify a functional connectivity signature of normal and poor social cognitive and neurocognitive performance.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Persons with poor social cognitive and neurocognitive performance were differentiated from those with normal performance by greater resting-state connectivity in the mirror neuron and mentalizing systems. We validated our findings by showing that poor performers also scored lower on functional outcome measures not included in the original analysis and by demonstrating neuroanatomical differences between the normal and poorly performing groups. We used a support vector machine classifier to demonstrate that functional connectivity alone is enough to distinguish normal and poorly performing participants, and we replicated our findings in an independent sample (n\u00a0= 75).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: A brief functional magnetic resonance imaging scan may ultimately be useful in future studies aimed at characterizing long-term illness trajectories and treatments that target specific brain circuitry in those with impaired cognition and function.",

However, it suffers from several disadvantages, including its lack of objectivity and the fact that it is a time-consuming process. Our aim was to test a recently established artificial intelligence (AI)-aided digital image analysis platform, Pathronus, and to compare it to conventional scoring by five observers on chromogenic IHC-stained slides belonging to three experimental groups. Because Pathronus operates on grayscale 0-255 values, we transformed the data to a seven-point scale for use by pathologists and scientists. The accuracy of these methods was evaluated by comparing statistical significance among groups with quantitative fluorescent IHC reference data on subsequent tissue sections. The pairwise inter-rater reliability of the scoring and converted Pathronus data varied from poor to moderate with Cohen\u2019s kappa, and overall agreement was poor within every experimental group using Fleiss\u2019 kappa. Only the original and converted that were obtained from Pathronus original were able to reproduce the statistical significance among the groups that were determined by the reference method. In this study, we present an AI-aided software that can identify cells of interest, differentiate among organelles, protein specific chromogenic labelling, and nuclear counterstaining after an initial training period, providing a feasible and more accurate alternative to semi-quantitative scoring.",

It remains unclear whether the decongestive effects of acetazolamide differ across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nThis is a prespecified analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ADVOR trial that enrolled 519 patients with acute heart failure (HF), clinical signs of volume overload (eg, edema, pleural effusion, or ascites), NTproBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) >1000 ng/L, or BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) >250 ng/mL to receive intravenous acetazolamide (500 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standardized intravenous loop diuretics (twice that of the oral home maintenance dose). Randomization was stratified according to LVEF (\u226440% or >40%). The primary end point was successful decongestion, defined as the absence of signs of volume overload within 3 days from randomization without the need for mandatory escalation of decongestive therapy because of poor urine output.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nMedian LVEF was 45% (25th to 75th percentile; 30% to 55%), and 43% had an LVEF \u226440%. Patients with lower LVEF were younger and more likely to be male with a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease, higher NTproBNP, less atrial fibrillation, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. No interaction on the overall beneficial treatment effect of acetazolamide to the primary end point of successful decongestion (OR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.18-2.63]; P=0.005; all P values for interaction >0.401) was found when LVEF was assessed per randomization stratum (\u226440% or >40%), or as HF with reduced ejection fraction, HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction, and HF with preserved ejection fraction, or on a continuous scale. Acetazolamide resulted in improved diuretic response measured by higher cumulative diuresis and natriuresis and shortened length of stay without treatment effect modification by baseline LVEF (all P values for interaction >0.160).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nWhen added to treatment with loop diuretics in patients with acute decompensated HF, acetazolamide improves the incidence of successful decongestion and diuretic response, and shortens length of stay without treatment effect modification by baseline LVEF.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION\r\n\r\nURL: https://www.\r\n\r\nCLINICALTRIALS\r\n\r\ngov; Unique identifier: NCT03505788.",

All participants received standardized loop diuretics and were randomized towards once daily intravenous acetazolamide (500\u2009mg) versus placebo, stratified according to study centre and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (\u226440% vs. &gt;40%). The primary endpoint was successful decongestion assessed by a dedicated score indicating no more than trace oedema and no other signs of congestion after three consecutive days of treatment without need for escalating treatment. Mean age was 78\u2009years, 63% were men, mean LVEF was 43%, and median NT-proBNP 6173\u2009pg/ml. The median clinical congestion score was 4 with an EuroQol-5 dimensions health utility index of 0.6. Patients with LVEF \u226440% were more often male, had more ischaemic heart disease, higher levels of NT-proBNP and less atrial fibrillation.

This study examines whether inequalities can already be observed in the molecular underpinnings of such diseases in the 30s, before many of them become prevalent. Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a large, nationally representative sample of US subjects who were followed for over two decades beginning in adolescence. We now have transcriptomic data (mRNA-seq) from a random subset of 4,543 of these young adults. SES in the household-of-origin and in young adulthood were examined as covariates of\r\n            a priori\r\n            -defined mRNA-based disease signatures and of specific gene transcripts identified\r\n            de novo\r\n            . An SES composite from young adulthood predicted many disease signatures, as did income and subjective status. Analyses highlighted SES-based inequalities in immune, inflammatory, ribosomal, and metabolic pathways, several of which play central roles in senescence. Many genes are also involved in transcription, translation, and diverse signaling mechanisms. Average causal-mediated effect models suggest that body mass index plays a key role in accounting for these relationships. Overall, the results reveal inequalities in molecular risk factors for chronic diseases often decades before diagnoses and suggest future directions for social signal transduction models that trace how social circumstances regulate the human genome.",

We evaluated whether ECG parameters are associated with the distribution and dynamic of LGE along the course of myocarditis.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Fifty-one patients with CMR confirmed acute myocarditis were included who underwent CMR with LGE and 12-lead ECG at baseline and 3-month follow-up at our institution. The association between the presence, regional distribution and change of ECG parameters and LGE was investigated using linear regression analysis. LGE was quantified as visual presence score (VPS) and visual transmurality score (VTS).\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Among many ECG parameters only\u2009>\u20091\u00a0mm ST-elevation (STE) was associated with VPS and VTS at baseline (\u03b2\u2009=\u20093.08 [95%CI: 1.75; 4.41], p\u2009=\u2009<\u20090.001 and \u03b2\u2009=\u20095.40 [95%CI: 1.92; 8.88], p\u2009=\u20090.004; respectively). STE was most frequent in lateral and inferior ECG-leads (48% and 31%) and it was associated with VPS and VTS in these localizations (p\u2009<\u20090.05 all), however no association between anterior-septal STE and LGE could be confirmed. At follow-up the regression of STE was associated with the regression of VPS and VTS in univariate analysis (\u03b2=-1.49 [95%CI: -2.41; -0.57], p\u2009=\u20090.003 and \u03b2=-4.87 [95%CI: -7.18; -2.56], p\u2009=\u20090.001, respectively), which remained significant for VTS using a multivariate model (\u03b2=-2.39 [95%CI: -3.32; -0.47], p\u2009=\u20090.019).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Although we demonstrated some promising associations between STE and LGE, the usability of ECG to estimate the territorial involvement and dynamical changes of LGE along the course of myocarditis is generally limited and cardiac magnetic resonance should be considered for this purpose.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of modified Cormack-Lehane (MCL) views and to elucidate variables for poor views in a large collective of children without anticipated airway difficulties.\r\nMETHODS: The departmental anaesthesia patient database was searched for patients who had undergone general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation between January 2007 and March 2017. Inclusion criteria were age from birth to 17.99 years, general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy, no history, symptoms or signs of a difficult airway and the best obtained MCL view documented in the database. Patient- and anaesthesia-related variables associated with a poor view (MCL IIb, III and IV) were elucidated using a logistic regression model.\r\nRESULTS: In all, 22 965 patients were included; of these, 17 593 were observed only once. The prevalence of the first observed MCL views I, IIa, IIb, III and IV was 90.6%, 8.5%, 0.86%, 0.05% and 0%, respectively. The logistic regression model indicates that age and gender are the most important variables associated with MCL views IIb and III in the model. The probability for MCL views IIb/III decreases across the first 5-7 years before increasing again.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The incidence of a poor grade of laryngoscopic view was found to be very low in children with a normal airway. They mainly occurred in infants and adolescent patients and were more common in male patients.",

Four readers (2 experienced, 2 novice) independently reviewed all MRI examinations (n\u00a0=\u00a0295) and assigned scores for subjective image quality (1-5; 1:poor, 5:excellent), the PI-QUAL and the PSHS scoring system. The original PI-RADS scores were extracted from the report and transperineal template saturation biopsy served as histopathological reference.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Inter-reader agreement was found to be good, with PSHS showing highest agreement (kappa: 0.65). The PSHS scoring system performed well assessing the influence of image quality on sensitivity of MR for clinically-significant cancer for the experienced readers using a PI-RADS score cut-off\u00a0\u2265\u00a03/\u22654, as did the PI-QUAL scoring system with a PI-RADS cut-off\u00a0\u2265\u00a04. For the less experienced radiologist, this was true for PSHS (clinically-significant and all cancers) and PI-QUAL scores (clinically-significant cancers) for a PI-RADS score\u00a0\u2265\u00a03. PSHS scores were positively associated with the detection of clinically-significant cancer based on a PI-RADS cut-off\u00a0\u2265\u00a04, OR 1.86 (95\u00a0% CI 1.22-2.82), and had the highest Somers' D.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The PSHS scoring system performed well in assessing the effect of image quality on detection rates, as did the PI-QUAL system. Since both systems focus on different aspects of image quality, their incorporation into prostate MRI reports could further enhance standardization and allow for a reliable assessment of image quality as a potential confounder in prostate MRI.",

Determining HRR deficiency (HRD) is of major clinical relevance as it is associated with therapeutic vulnerabilities and remains poorly investigated in sarcoma. Here, we show that specific sarcoma entities exhibit high levels of genomic instability signatures and molecular alterations in HRR genes, while harboring a complex pattern of chromosomal instability. Furthermore, sarcomas carrying HRDness traits exhibit a distinct SARC-HRD transcriptional signature that predicts PARP inhibitor sensitivity in patient-derived sarcoma cells. Concomitantly, HRD$^{high}$ sarcoma cells lack RAD51 nuclear foci formation upon DNA damage, further evidencing defects in HRR. We further identify the WEE1 kinase as a therapeutic vulnerability for sarcomas with HRDness and demonstrate the clinical benefit of combining DNA damaging agents and inhibitors of DNA repair pathways ex vivo and in the clinic. In summary, we provide a personalized oncological approach to treat sarcoma patients successfully.",

Pain experienced in the preceding week was assessed using numeral rating scale (NRS). We performed a negative binomial regression analysis to assess pain in IIMs subtypes and whether demographics, disease activity, general health status, and physical function had an impact on pain scores.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Of 6988 participants included, 15.1% had IIMs, 27.9% had other AIRDs, and 57.0% were wAIDs. The median pain NRS in patients with IIMs, other AIRDs, and wAIDs were 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR]\u00a0=\u00a01.0-5.0), 3.0 (IQR\u00a0=\u00a01.0-6.0), and 1.0 (IQR\u00a0=\u00a00-2.0), respectively (P\u00a0<\u20090.001). Regression analysis adjusted for gender, age, and ethnicity revealed that overlap myositis and antisynthetase syndrome had the highest pain (NRS\u00a0=\u00a04.0, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a03.5-4.5, and NRS\u00a0=\u00a03.6, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a03.1-4.1, respectively). An additional association between pain and poor functional status was observed in all groups. Female gender was associated with higher pain scores in almost all scenarios. Increasing age was associated with higher pain NRS scores in some scenarios of disease activity, and Asian and Hispanic ethnicities had reduced pain scores in some functional status scenarios.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Patients with IIMs reported higher pain levels than wAIDs, but less than patients with other AIRDs. Pain is a disabling manifestation of IIMs and is associated with a poor functional status.",

However, when humans condition punishment on other factors than poor contribution, punishment can become ineffective and group cooperation deteriorates. Here we show that this happens in pluriform groups where members have different socio-demographic characteristics. In our public good provision experiment, participants were confronted with a public good from which all group members benefitted equally, and in-between rounds they could punish each other. Groups were uniform (members shared the same academic background) or pluriform (half the members shared the same academic background, and the other half shared another background). We show that punishment effectively enforced cooperation in uniform groups where punishment was conditioned on poor contribution. In pluriform groups, punishment was conditioned on poor contribution too, but also partially on others\u2019 social-demographic characteristics\u2014dissimilar others were punished more than similar others regardless of their contribution. As a result, punishment lost its effectiveness in deterring free-riding and maintaining public good provision. Follow-up experiments indicated that such discriminatory punishment was used to demarcate and reinforce subgroup boundaries. This work reveals that peer punishment fails to enforce cooperation in groups with a pluriform structure, which is rule rather than exception in contemporary societies.",

Therefore, exploring the spatiotemporal dynamics and causes of poverty is of great significance to the sustainable poverty reduction of the \u201cpost poverty alleviation era\u201d in China. This paper used the multisource big data of 2022 counties in China from 2000 to 2015 to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework to explore the multidimensional poverty situation in China. The results showed the following findings: There is an obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity of multidimensional poverty, showing a typical stair-like gradient from high in the west to low in the east, with the poverty level in state-designated poverty counties higher and intensifying over time. The spatial differentiation of multidimensional poverty is contributed to by multiple factors, in which the geographical condition has a stronger impact on state-designated poverty counties, while natural endowment and human resources have a stronger effect on non-state-designated poverty counties. These things considered, the regional poverty causes were relatively stable before 2015, but the poverty spatial agglomeration of some regions in the Northwest, Northeast, and Yangtze River Economic Belt has undergone significant changes after 2015. These findings can help policymakers better target plans to eliminate various types of poverty in different regions.",

However, welfare practices for children and adolescents have also been linked to a higher risk for maltreatment, trauma, and deprivation. Due to such early-life adversity, affected individuals often report a life course depicted by further trauma, socio-economic disadvantage, mental and physical ill-health. Examination of the long-term health correlates of enforced child welfare practices, as well as potential mediators, have previously been neglected in later life. It was therefore the purpose of these studies to examine the long-term correlates of enforced child welfare practices; the associated maltreatment, trauma, and deprivation; and the physical and mental health outcomes in Swiss older survivors (n=132, MAGE=71 years) and an age-matched control group (n=125). These studies further examined the mediating role of socio-economic factors (e.g., education, income), self-esteem, and self-compassion. Mental health was assessed with a structured clinical interview; physical health, self-esteem, and self-compassion with psychometric instruments. Survivors reported significantly more types and severity of childhood maltreatment, trauma, and deprivation than the control group. They also reported significantly more lifetime and current mental health disorders and more physical illnesses. Socio-economic factors and self-esteem, but not self-compassion, acted as significant mediators. Exposure to maltreatment, trauma, and deprivation in childhood and adolescence is linked to poorer mental and physical health in later life. Potential targets for intervention and health-protective measures include socio-economic factors and self-esteem, which were found to diminish the detrimental long-term impact of early-life adversity and disadvantage into later life.",

In these films, while a spider often plays the villain, a cobweb can appear not only as a trap but also as various objects due to its simple but unique form, often providing clues for \u201cthe passage of time\u201d by giving the impression of desolation or even poverty. Most importantly, a cobweb functions as various Depth Cues because of its web-like structure and thus creates visual depth in a two-dimensional world. Its transparency is also advantageous in the spatial composition of cell animations, which consist of multiple layers. In The Old Mill, a translucent plane formed by a cobweb right in the front stresses the cross-over motion of focus\u2014going deep into the mill\u2014thereby enhancing the impression of depth created by a multiplane camera. Moreover, depicting a delicate spider web also serves as the optimal showcase for the Disney Studio\u2019s advanced colour techniques and sophisticated drawing skills.",

Moreover, the majority of studies have focused only on predefined regions or functional networks rather than connectivity throughout the entire brain. Here, we investigated differences in resting-state functional connectivity between OCD patients and healthy controls (HC) using mega-analysis of data from 1024 OCD patients and 1028 HC from 28 independent samples of the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. We assessed group differences in whole-brain functional connectivity at both the regional and network level, and investigated whether functional connectivity could serve as biomarker to identify patient status at the individual level using machine learning analysis. The mega-analyses revealed widespread abnormalities in functional connectivity in OCD, with global hypo-connectivity (Cohen\u2019s d: -0.27 to -0.13) and few hyper-connections, mainly with the thalamus (Cohen\u2019s d: 0.19 to 0.22). Most hypo-connections were located within the sensorimotor network and no fronto-striatal abnormalities were found. Overall, classification performances were poor, with area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) scores ranging between 0.567 and 0.673, with better classification for medicated (AUC\u2009=\u20090.702) than unmedicated (AUC\u2009=\u20090.608) patients versus healthy controls. These findings provide partial support for existing pathophysiological models of OCD and highlight the important role of the sensorimotor network in OCD. However, resting-state connectivity does not so far provide an accurate biomarker for identifying patients at the individual level.",

We investigated the long-term trajectories of mental HRQoL (m-HRQoL) in mothers of children with CHD and examined risk factors for persistent low\u00a0m-HRQoL.\r\n            \r\nMethods: One hundred twenty-five mothers of children with CHD completed a standardized questionnaire on m-HRQoL (mental subscale SF-12) after the children\u2019s first open-heart surgery and subsequently when the children were 1, 4, 6, 10, and 13\u00a0years old. A z-score for m-HRQoL was calculated with national norms. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify subgroups of mothers with regards to their m-HRQoL trajectories over time. Regression analysis investigated predictors for chronically low\u00a0m-HRQoL.\r\n            \r\nResults: Compared to norms, mothers of children with CHD had significantly lower m-HRQoL immediately after open-heart surgery (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.30 (CI-95: \u22120.44, \u22120.15)). Subsequently, m-HRQoL increased to a normal level (m-HRQoL compared to the norm from 1 to 13\u00a0years: \u03b2 ranges between\u00a00.05 and 0.27). LCGA revealed two distinct groups of m-HRQoL trajectories: A group with normal m-HRQoL (75% of mothers, means z-scores range between \u2212\u00a00.76 and 0.62) and a group with chronically low m-HRQoL (25% of mothers, mean z-scores range between \u22121.32 and \u22120.10). Chronically, low\u00a0m-HRQoL was associated with poorer social support (OR\u2009=\u20093.39 (CI-95: 1.40, 8.49), p\u2009=\u20090.008) but not with parental education, migration background, number of open-heart surgeries, diagnosis of a univentricular CHD, or low IQ.\r\n\r\nConclusion: A quarter of mothers of children with CHD have chronically low\u00a0m-HRQoL throughout their child\u2019s development, especially those mothers with poor social support. Further studies of family-oriented approaches are needed to identify and support these mothers and reinforce parental well-being.",

METHODS Treatment-naive patients with unresectable stage III-IV melanoma received nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (four doses) followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg (240 mg following a protocol amendment) once every 2 weeks for \u226424 months. The primary end point was the incidence of grade 3-5 select treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Overall survival (OS) was a secondary end point. Outcomes were evaluated in subgroups defined by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), brain metastasis status, and melanoma subtype. RESULTS In total, 533 patients received at least one dose of study drug. Grade 3-5 select TRAEs affecting the GI (16%), hepatic (15%), endocrine (11%), skin (7%), renal (2%), and pulmonary (1%) systems occurred in the all-treated population; similar incidence rates were observed across all subgroups. At 21.6 months' median follow-up, 24-month OS rates were 63% in the all-treated population, 44% in the ECOG PS 2 subgroup (including patients with cutaneous melanoma only), 71% in the brain metastasis subgroup, 36% in the ocular/uveal melanoma subgroup, and 38% in the mucosal melanoma subgroup. CONCLUSION Nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed by nivolumab monotherapy was tolerable in patients with advanced melanoma and poor prognostic characteristics. Efficacy was similar between the all-treated population and patients with brain metastases. Reduced efficacy was observed in patients with ECOG PS 2, ocular/uveal melanoma, and/or mucosal melanoma, highlighting the continued need for novel treatment options for these difficult-to-treat patients.",

        "document": "Title: Systemic LRG1 Expression in Melanoma is Associated with Disease Progression and Recurrence\nAbstract: The response rates upon neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in stage III melanoma are higher as compared with stage IV disease. Given that successful ICB depends on systemic immune response, we hypothesized that systemic immune suppression might be a mechanism responsible for lower response rates in late-stage disease, and also potentially with disease recurrence in early-stage disease. Plasma and serum samples of cohorts of patients with melanoma were analyzed for circulating proteins using mass spectrometry proteomic profiling and Olink proteomic assay. A cohort of paired samples of patients with stage III that progressed to stage IV disease (n = 64) was used to identify markers associated with higher tumor burden. Baseline patient samples from the OpACIN-neo study (n = 83) and PRADO study (n = 49; NCT02977052) were used as two independent cohorts to analyze whether the potential identified markers are also associated with disease recurrence after neoadjuvant ICB therapy. When comparing baseline proteins overlapping between patients with progressive disease and patients with recurrent disease, we found leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) to be associated with worse prognosis. Especially nonresponder patients to neoadjuvant ICB (OpACIN-neo) with high LRG1 expression had a poor outcome with an estimated 36-month event-free survival of 14% as compared with 83% for nonresponders with a low LRG1 expression (P = 0.014). This finding was validated in an independent cohort (P = 0.0021). LRG1 can be used as a biomarker to identify patients with high risk for disease progression and recurrence, and might be a target to be combined with neoadjuvant ICB.\r\n               \r\n                  Significance:\r\n                  LRG1 could serve as a potential target and as a biomarker to identify patients with high risk for disease recurrence, and consequently benefit from additional therapies and intensive follow-up.",

Clinical manifestation can be variable and therefore, deletion size, inherited elastin (ELN) and LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) alleles, gender, and parental origin of deletion have been investigated for associations with clinical outcome. In an analysis of 85 confirmed deletion cases, no statistically significant associations were found after Bonferroni's correction for multiple pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, the present data do not support presence of imprinted genes in the WBS common deletion despite a nonsignificant excess of maternal over paternal deletions. Maternal deletion cases were more likely to have a large head circumference in the present data. Also, pairwise comparisons between individual WBS clinical features have been conducted and revealed significant associations between (1) low birth weight and poor postnatal weight gain (<10th percentile at the time of examination) and (2) transient infantile hypercalcemia and a stellate iris pattern. The latter association could indicate a common underlying etiology.",

We aimed to compare and analyze differences in visual analog scale (VAS) scores (0-10\u00a0cm) for fatigue (VAS-F) in patients with IIMs, non-IIM systemic autoimmune diseases (SAIDs), and healthy controls (HCs). We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the data from the COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) international patient self-reported e-survey. The COVAD survey was circulated from December 2020 to August 2021, and details including demographics, COVID-19 history, vaccination details, SAID details, global health, and functional status were collected from adult patients having received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Fatigue experienced 1 week prior to survey completion was assessed using a single-item 10\u00a0cm VAS. Determinants of fatigue were analyzed in regression models. Six thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight respondents (mean age 43.8\u00a0years, 72% female; 55% White) were included in the analysis. The overall VAS-F score was 3 (IQR 1-6). Patients with IIMs had similar fatigue scores (5, IQR 3-7) to non-IIM SAIDs [5 (IQR 2-7)], but higher compared to HCs (2, IQR 1-5; P\u2009<\u20090.001), regardless of disease activity. In adjusted analysis, higher VAS-F scores were seen in females (reference female; coefficient -0.17; 95%CI -0.21 to -13; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and Caucasians (reference Caucasians; coefficient -0.22; 95%CI -0.30 to -0.14; P\u2009<\u20090.001 for Asians and coefficient -0.08; 95%CI -0.13 to 0.30; P\u2009=\u20090.003 for Hispanics) in our cohort. Our study found that patients with IIMs exhibit considerable fatigue, similar to other SAIDs and higher than healthy individuals. Women and Caucasians experience greater fatigue scores, allowing identification of stratified groups for optimized multidisciplinary care and\u00a0improve\u00a0outcomes such as\u00a0quality of life.",

A prospective cohort study\nAbstract: PURPOSE\r\n\r\nTo assess patient outcomes following reverse shoulder arthroplasty in patients with complex proximal humerus fracture and the clinical implications of greater tuberosity malunions.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nThis prospective study included 56 patients who underwent RSA (DELTA XTEND\u2122, DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, IN, USA) to treat proximal humerus fractures. We used a standardized suture technique to reattach the tuberosities. Demographic, comorbidity, and radiological parameters were collected. Assessments at 2-year follow-up (n\u2009=\u200949) are given as follows: range of motion (ROM), pain level, Constant Murley scores (CS), subjective shoulder value (SSV), and tuberosity healing.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nAnatomic tuberosity healing was achieved in 31 (55%) patients (group 1), 14 (25%) had a malunion (group 2), and complete migration occurred in 11 (20%) (group 3). No statistically significant differences between groups 1 and 2 were detected: CS (p\u2009=\u20090.53), SSV (p\u2009=\u20090.07), ROM (forward flexion (FF) p\u2009=\u20090.19, internal rotation (IR) p\u2009=\u20090.34, and external rotation (ER) p\u2009=\u20090.76).

Three complications (group 1) occurred: one-stage revision after low-grade infection, haematoma due to early rivaroxaban intake, and open reduction and internal fixation for acromion insufficiency fracture. No patients showed signs of stem or glenoid loosening after 2\u00a0years.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nCases with complete superior migration experienced poorer clinical outcomes than those with anatomic healing. Despite a relatively high malunion rate, the outcomes were not significantly worse in these patients compared to anatomically healed GT cases.",

Methods: In this observational study, all patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 in 2020 in the Cantonal Hospital of Baden were included. We assessed clinical characteristics, in-hospital outcomes as well as long-term outcomes with a mean follow-up time of 278 (\u00b190) days. Results: Amongst 646 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (59% male, median age: 70 (IQR: 59-80)) in 2020, a total of 177 (27.4%) patients were transferred to the intermediate/intensive care unit (IMC/ICU), and 76 (11.8%) were invasively ventilated during their hospitalization. Ninety patients (13.9%) died. A total of 116 patients (18%) showed AF on admission of which 34 (29%) had new-onset AF. Patients with COVID-19 and newly diagnosed AF were more likely to require invasive ventilation (OR: 3.5; p = 0.01) but did not encounter an increased in-hospital mortality. Moreover, AF neither increased long-term mortality nor the number of rehospitalizations during follow-up after adjusting for confounders. Conclusions: In patients suffering from COVID-19, the new-onset of AF on admission was associated with an increased risk of invasive ventilation and transfer to the IMC/ICU but did not affect in-hospital or long-term mortality.",

We conducted a narrative review to examine whether its use as a metric might be appropriate for patient selection.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nA literature review was conducted to identify relevant studies that highlight the benefits of palliative RT in timely symptom management among patients with a poor performance status, the accuracy of predicting survival near the end of life and ways to speed up the process of RT administration through rapid response clinics.\r\n\r\nKEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS\r\n\r\nSeveral trials have demonstrated substantial response rates for pain and/or bleeding by four weeks and sometimes within the first two weeks after RT. Models of patient survival have limited accuracy, particularly for predicting whether patients will die within the next 30 days. Dedicated Rapid Access Palliative RT (RAPRT) clinics, in which patients are assessed, simulated and treated on the same day, reduce the number of patient visits to the radiation oncology department and hence the burden on the patient as well as costs.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nSingle-fraction palliative RT should be offered to eligible patients if they are able to attend treatment and could potentially benefit from symptom palliation, irrespective of predicted life expectancy. We discourage the routine use of the 30-day mortality as the only metric to decide whether to offer RT. More common implementation of RAPRT clinics could result in a significant benefit for patients of all life expectancies, but particularly those having short ones.",

We compared SRS outcomes for SCLC and non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC) where SRS is well established.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nMulticenter first-line SRS outcomes for SCLC and NSCLC from 2000-2022 were retrospectively collected (N=892-SCLC/N=4,785-NSCLC). Data from the prospective JLGK0901 SRS trial were analyzed as a comparison cohort (N=98-SCLC/N=794-NSCLC). OS and CNS-progression were analyzed using Cox-Proportional-Hazard and Fine-Gray models, respectively, with multivariable (MV) adjustment (including age/sex/performance-status/year/extracranial disease/BrM-number/BrM-volume). Mutation-stratified analyses were performed in propensity score-matched (PSM) retrospective cohorts of EGFR/ALK-positive-NSCLC, mutation-negative-NSCLC, and SCLC.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOS was superior with NSCLC over SCLC in the retrospective dataset (median-OS, 10.5 vs 8.6 months, MV-p<0.001) and JLGK0901. Hazard estimates for first CNS-progression favoring NSCLC were similar in both datasets but reached significance in the retrospective dataset only (MV-HR:0.82 [95%-CI:0.73-0.92], p=0.001). In the PSM cohorts, there were continued OS advantages for NSCLC (median-OS, 23.7 [EGFR/ALK-positive-NSCLC] vs 13.6 [mutation-negative-NSCLC] vs 10.4 months [SCLC], pairwise-p-values<0.001), but no significant differences in CNS-progression. Neurological mortality and number of lesions at CNS-progression were similar for NSCLC and SCLC patients. Leptomeningeal-progression was increased in NSCLC patients in the retrospective dataset only (MV-HR:1.61 [95%-CI:1.14-2.26], p=0.007).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAfter SRS, SCLC was associated with shorter OS compared to NSCLC. CNS progression occurred earlier in SCLC overall but was similar in patients matched on baseline characteristics. Neurological mortality, lesions at CNS-progression, and leptomeningeal-progression were comparable. These findings may better inform clinical decision-making for SCLC patients.",

We compared the agreement of validated study data on sepsis criteria with ICD-10 coding abstraction obtained at the participating hospitals.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nWe analyzed 998 hospital admissions of children with blood culture-proven sepsis. The sensitivity of ICD-10 coding abstraction was 60% (95%-CI 57-63) for sepsis; 35% (95%-CI 31-39) for sepsis with organ dysfunction, using an explicit abstraction strategy; and 65% (95%-CI 61-69) using an implicit abstraction strategy. For septic shock, the sensitivity of ICD-10 coding abstraction was 43% (95%-CI 37-50). Agreement of ICD-10 coding abstraction with validated study data varied by the underlying infection type and disease severity (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The estimated national incidence of sepsis, inferred from ICD-10 coding abstraction, was 12.5 per 100,000 children (95%-CI 11.7-13.5) and 21.0 per 100,000 children (95%-CI 19.8-22.2) using validated study data.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nIn this population-based study, we found a poor representation of sepsis and sepsis with organ dysfunction by ICD-10 coding abstraction in children with blood culture-proven sepsis when compared against a prospective validated research dataset. Sepsis estimates in children based on ICD-10 coding may thus severely underestimate the true prevalence of the disease.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s44253-023-00006-1.",

However, second-line therapies are currently recommended only when ALP levels remain above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (xULN) after 12-month UDCA. We assessed whether, in patients considered good responders to UDCA, normal ALP levels were associated with significant survival gains.\r\n\r\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1,047 patients with PBC who attained an adequate response to UDCA according to Paris-2 criteria. Time to liver-related complications, liver transplantation or death was assessed using adjusted restricted mean survival time analysis. The overall incidence rate of events was 17.0 (95%CI 13.7 - 21.1) per 1,000 out of 4,763.2 patient-years. On the whole population, normal serum ALP values (but not normal GGT, ALT, or AST; or total bilirubin < 0.6 xULN) were associated with an overall absolute complication-free survival gain at 10 years of 7.6 months (95%CI 2.7 - 12.6, p = 0.003). In subgroup analysis, this association was significant in patients with a liver stiffness measurement \u2265 10 kPa and/or age \u2264 62 years, with a 10-year absolute complication-free survival gain of 52.8 months (95%CI 45.7 - 59.9, p < 0.001) when these two conditions were met.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: PBC patients with an adequate response to UDCA and persistent ALP elevation between 1.1 and 1.5 xULN, particularly those with advanced fibrosis and/or who are sufficiently young, remain at risk of poor outcome. Further therapeutic efforts should be considered for these patients.",

A multi-institutional survey of zoos (n=62) in Europe, North America and Australia was conducted to evaluate relationships between husbandry, feeding, reproduction and medical management. Data was collected on 169 animals, 81 females, 86 males and two of unknown sex, ranging in age from 1 month to 16 years. This study indicates that factors relevant to reproductive success include paternal parenting behaviour, restricting access to indoor enclosures, the presence of previous offspring during the breeding season and insuffi cient monitoring during the reproductive period. Health concerns most frequently reported over the past 15 years were poor body condition, cystinuria and nephritis. Diets varied considerably, with North American zoo diets typically including Mazuri\u00ae Maned Wolf Diet or commercial dog foods, and European and Australian zoo diets primarily consisting of small prey animals with varying additions of fruit and vegetables. The most notable difference between all zoo diets and the diet of free-ranging maned wolves was a lack of grasses and Solanum fruits in zoo diets. The fi ndings in this study suggest that zoo diets would mirror the diets of free-ranging animals more effectively if they contained equal proportions of animal and plant material, which could potentially also help to address poor body condition and cystinuria. To address the poor reproductive success, further research, including close monitoring during the reproductive period, is warranted.",

In early adolescence (age 13), we assessed indicators of mental health (internalizing symptoms), stressor exposure (cumulative stressful life events), and family socialization (supportive parent\u2013child interactions). In early adulthood (age 22), during the first COVID-19-related Swiss national lockdown, we assessed cumulative pandemic-related stressors, distress (poor well-being, hopelessness, and perceived disruptions to life) and adaptive coping. Early adolescent internalizing symptoms predicted lower well-being, more hopelessness, and perceived lifestyle disruptions in early adulthood, during the pandemic. Cumulative stressful life events during early adolescence moderated the association between cumulative pandemic-related stressors and perceived lifestyle disruptions. Supportive parent\u2013child interactions fostered subsequent engagement in adaptive coping, which, in turn, predicted less hopelessness and better well-being. Findings reveal that early adolescent development is linked with distress and adaptive coping in later periods.",

Cross-sectional analysis of studies for DLSS included in systematic reviews (SA) and meta-analyses (MA) indexed in the Cochrane Library. We extracted all outcome measures for pain and disability. We assessed whether the studies provided external references for the validity of the outcome measures and the quality of the validation studies. Out of 20 SA/MA, 95 primary studies used 242 outcome measures for pain and/or disability. Most commonly used were the VAS (n\u2009=\u200969), the Oswestry Disability Index (n\u2009=\u200953) and the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (n\u2009=\u200922).

The quality of the validation studies was mainly poor. The Zurich Claudication Questionnaire was the only disease specific tool with adequate validation for assessing treatment response in DLSS.

        "document": "Title: Why is female gender associated with poorer clinical outcome after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty?\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of gender-specific research after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). While previous studies have documented worse outcome in women - a more thorough understanding of why outcome may differ is needed. We therefore asked: (1) Are there gender-specific differences in pre- and postoperative clinical scores, complications, surgery-related parameters and demographics? (2) Is female gender an independent risk factor for poorer clinical outcome after RTSA? (3) If so, why is female gender associated with poorer outcome after RTSA?\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2005 and 2019, 987 primary RTSAs were performed in our institution. After exclusion criteria were applied, data of 422 female and 271 male patients were analyzed. Clinical outcome (absolute/relative Constant Score (a/rCS) and Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV)), complications (intra- and/or postoperative fracture, loosening), surgery-related parameters (indication, implant related characteristics) and demographics (age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and number of previous surgeries) were evaluated. Pre- and postoperative radiographs were analyzed (Critical Shoulder Angle (CSA), Deltoid-Tuberosity Index (DTI), Reverse Shoulder Angle (RSA), Lateralization (LSA) and Distalization Shoulder Angle (DSA)).\r\nRESULTS: Preoperative clinical scores (aCS, rCS, SSV and pain level) as well as postoperative clinical outcome (aCS, rCS) were significantly worse in women. However, the improvement between pre- and postoperative outcome was significantly higher in female patients for rCS (p=0.037), internal rotation (p<0.001) and regarding pain (p<0.001). Female patients had a significantly higher number of intraoperative as well as postoperative fractures (24.9% vs. 11.4%, p<0.001). The proportion of female patients with a DTI<1.4 was significantly higher than in males (p=0.01). Female gender was an independent negative predictor for postoperative rCS (p=0.047, Coefficient -0.084) and pain (p=0.017, Coefficient -0.574). In addition to female sex per se being a predictive factor of worse outcome, females were significantly more likely to meet two of the three most significant predictive factors: (1) significantly worse preoperative clinical scores and (2) higher rate of intra- and/or postoperative fractures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Female sex is a very weak, but isolated, negative predictive factor that negatively affects objective clinical outcome (rCS) after RTSA. However, differences did not reach the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and it is not a predictor for subjective outcome (SSV). The main reason for worse outcome in female patients seems to be a combination of higher preoperative disability and higher incidence of fractures. To improve the outcome of women, all measures that contribute to the reduction of perioperative fracture risk should be utilized.",

Demographic data and the responses to the Patient's Global Impression of Change scale collected at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year were analyzed with the \u03c7$^{2}$ test. Baseline pain and disability levels were measured using the numeric rating scale (NRS), Oswestry questionnaire for LBP, and Bournemouth questionnaire for patients with NP and analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test between the 2 groups. To detect significant predictors of medication use at baseline, logistic regression analysis was performed.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nPatients with acute LBP and NP were more likely than those with chronic pain to take pain medication (P < .001 LBP; P\u00a0=\u00a0.003 NP). Medication use was more likely with patients with radiculopathy (P < .001 LBP; P\u00a0=\u00a0.05 NP) who were smokers (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008 LBP; P\u00a0=\u00a0.024 NP) and those reporting below-average general health (P < .001 LBP and NP). Pain medication users had higher baseline pain (P < .001 LBP and NP) and disability (P < .001 LBP and NP) scores.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nPatients with LBP and NP had significantly higher pain and disability levels at baseline, tended to have radiculopathy and poor health, were smokers, and presented during the acute phase. However, for this sample of patients, there were no differences in subjective improvement between users and non-users of pain medication for any data collection time point, which has management implications.",

The rationale for these financial instruments seems clear, as many households are heavily invested in housing and standard financial instruments offer a poor hedge. In practice, however, most of the property derivatives available have been targeted to meet the needs of institutional investors, not those of owner-occupiers. Building on the recent launch of the first Swiss property derivative, we here propose index-linked mortgages tailored to retail consumers. The payments of these mortgages depend on the corresponding housing market performance. We further price the instruments, discuss the stabilization of the homeowner's net wealth, and quantify the expected decrease in the mortgage default risk achieved by this immunization effect.",

Using a novel panel data set, we find that financial experts exert significant influence, though not necessarily in the interest of shareholders. When commercial bankers join boards, external funding increases and investment-cash flow sensitivity decreases. However, the increased financing flows to firms with good credit but poor investment opportunities. Similarly, investment bankers on boards are associated with larger bond issues but worse acquisitions. We find little evidence that financial experts affect compensation policy. The results suggest that increasing financial expertise on boards may not benefit shareholders if conflicting interests (e.g., bank profits) are neglected.",

We develop a constrained parameter learning approach for sequential estimation allowing for belief revisions. Empirically, we find that mixed-frequency models improve predictability, not only because of the combination of predictors with different frequencies but also due to the preservation of high-frequency features such as time-varying volatility. Temporally aggregated models misspecify the evolution frequency of the volatility dynamics, resulting in poor volatility timing and worse portfolio performance than the mixed-frequency specification. These results highlight the importance of preserving the potential mixed-frequency nature of predictors and volatility in predictive regressions.",

Cross-country evidence\nAbstract: We investigate the determinants of multiple-bank relationships using a new data set comprising 1079 firms across 20 European countries.

After controlling for a variety of firm-specific characteristics, we find that firms maintain more bank relationships, on average, in countries with inefficient judicial systems and poor enforcement of creditor rights.

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether anxiety has an impact on the short-term functional outcome of patients with an OVCF. Furthermore, a direct impact of the fracture on the patient's anxiety during hospitalization should be recognized.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: All inpatients with an OVCF of the thoracolumbar spine from 2017 to 2020 were included. Trauma mechanism, analgetic medication, anti-osteoporotic therapy, timed-up-and-go test (TuG), mobility, Barthel index, Oswestry-Disability Index (ODI) and EQ5D-5L were documented.For statistical analysis, the U test, chi-square independence test, Spearman correlation, General Linear Model for repeated measures, Bonferroni analysis and Wilcoxon test were used. The item anxiety/depression of the EQ5D-5L was analyzed to describe the patients' anxiousness.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Data from 518 patients from 17 different hospitals were evaluated. Fracture severity showed a significant correlation (r = .087, P = .0496) with anxiety. During the hospital stay, pain medication (P < .001), anti-osteoporotic medication (P < .001), and initiation of surgical therapy (P < .001) were associated with less anxiety. The anxiety of a patient at discharge was negatively related to the functional outcomes at the individual follow-up: TuG (P < .001), Barthel index (P < .001), ODI (P < .001) and EQ5D-5L (P < .001).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Higher anxiety is associated with lower functional outcome after OVCF. The item anxiety/depression of the EQ5D-5L provides an easily accessible, quick and simple tool that can be used to screen for poor outcomes and may also offer the opportunity for a specific anxiety intervention.",

The state distribution is approximately represented by a set of optimal generalized moments. Deep neural networks are used to approximate the value and policy functions, and the objective is optimized over directly simulated paths. In addition to being an accurate global solver, this method has three additional features. First, it is computationally efficient in solving complex heterogeneous agent models, and it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Second, it provides a general and interpretable representation of the distribution over individual states, which is crucial in addressing the classical question of whether and how heterogeneity matters in macroeconomics. Third, it solves the constrained efficiency problem as easily as it solves the competitive equilibrium, which opens up new possibilities for normative studies. As a new application, we study constrained efficiency in heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks. We find that in the presence of aggregate risk, a utilitarian planner would raise aggregate capital for redistribution less than in absence of it because poor households do more precautionary savings and thus rely less on labor income.",

Emergency aneurysm treatment may decrease this risk, but is a logistic challenge and economic burden. We aimed to investigate whether aneurysm treatment <6\u2009h after rupture is associated with a decreased risk of poor functional outcome compared to aneurysm treatment 6-24\u2009h after rupture.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\nWe used data of patients included in the ULTRA trial (NCT02684812). All patients in ULTRA were admitted within 24\u2009h after aneurysm rupture. For the current study, we excluded patients in whom the aneurysm was not treated <24\u2009h after rupture. We calculated crude and adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals using Poisson regression analyses for poor functional outcome (death or dependency, assessed by the modified Rankin Scale) after aneurysm treatment <6\u2009h versus 6-24\u2009h after rupture. Adjustments were made for age, sex, clinical condition on admission (WFNS scale), amount of extravasated blood (Fisher score), aneurysm location, tranexamic acid treatment, and aneurysm treatment modality.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nWe included 497 patients. Poor outcome occurred in 63/110 (57%) patients treated within 6\u2009h compared to 145/387 (37%) patients treated 6-24\u2009h after rupture (crude RR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.24-1.88; adjusted RR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.11-1.66).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAneurysm treatment <6\u2009h is not associated with better functional outcome than aneurysm treatment 6-24\u2009h after rupture. Our results do not support a strategy aiming to treat every patient with a ruptured aneurysm <6\u2009h after rupture.",

Recent contributions have challenged the argument that landholding elites oppose suffrage extension if geographically fixed assets are unequally distributed. We advance research on this long-standing question by exploiting exogenous variance to reinvestigate the relationship. Using multiple instruments, we find that landholding inequality decreases support for suffrage extension. By focusing on traditional patterns of social control, we explore an empirically neglected mechanism linking landholding inequality and democratization. Taking advantage of four direct democratic votes between 1866 and 1877 in Switzerland, we demonstrate that landholding inequality also influences the political preferences of ordinary citizens who do not control these resources. This paper shows that high levels of landholding inequality provide local elites with the incentive and the means to align the local population's voting behaviour with their political goals. Supplementary analyses using qualitative and quantitative data further substantiate this social control mechanism.",

Affected patients are subject to a potential decrease in quality of care and a greater risk of a poor outcome. The diagnostic process is a complex task that starts with information gathering, followed by integration and interpretation of data, hypothesis generation and, finally, confirmation of a (hopefully correct) diagnosis. This may be particularly challenging in the patient who is critically ill where a good history may not be forthcoming and/or clinical, laboratory and imaging features are non\u2010specific. The aim of this narrative review is to analyse and describe common causes of diagnostic error in the intensive care unit, highlighting the multiple types of cognitive bias, and to suggest a diagnostic framework. To inform this review, we performed a literature search to identify relevant articles, particularly those pertinent to unclear diagnoses in patients who are critically ill. Clinicians should be cognisant as to how they formulate diagnoses and utilise debiasing strategies. Multidisciplinary teamwork and more time spent with the patient, supported by effective and efficient use of electronic healthcare records and decision support resources, is likely to improve the quality of the diagnostic process, patient care and outcomes.",

The aim of the present study was to compare the well-validated Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) and Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis (CAHP)-scores to the less complex MIRACLE2- and Target Temperature Management (TTM)-scores.\r\n\r\nMethods: This was a post-hoc analysis of the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM2) trial. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. The primary outcome was discriminatory performance assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristics-curve (AUROC), with the outcome of interest being poor functional outcome or death (modified Rankin Scale 4-6) at 6 months after OHCA.\r\n\r\nResults: Data on functional outcome at 6 months were available for 1829 cases, which constituted the study population. The pooled AUROC for the MIRACLE2-score was 0.810 (95% CI 0.790-0.828), 0.835 (95% CI 0.816-0.852) for the TTM-score, 0.820 (95% CI 0.800-0.839) for the CAHP-score and 0.770 (95% CI 0.748-0.791) for the OHCA-score. At the cut-offs needed to achieve specificities >95%, sensitivities were <40% for all four scoring systems.\r\n\r\nConclusions: The TTM-, MIRACLE2- and CAHP-scores are all capable of providing objective risk estimates accurate enough to be used as part of a holistic patient assessment after OHCA of a suspected cardiac origin. Due to its simplicity, the MIRACLE2-score could be a practical solution for both clinical application and risk stratification within trials.",

This predefined exploratory analysis provides more detailed estimation of brain dysfunction for the comparison of the 2 intervention regimens.ObjectivesTo investigate the effects of targeted hypothermia vs targeted normothermia on functional outcome with focus on societal participation and cognitive function in survivors 6 months after OHCA.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis study is a predefined analysis of an international multicenter, randomized clinical trial that took place from November 2017 to January 2020 and included participants at 61 hospitals in 14 countries. A structured follow-up for survivors performed at 6 months was by masked outcome assessors. The last follow-up took place in October 2020. Participants included 1861 adult (older than 18 years) patients with OHCA who were comatose at hospital admission. At 6 months, 939 of 1861 were alive and invited to a follow-up, of which 103 of 939 declined or were missing.InterventionsRandomization 1:1 to temperature control with targeted hypothermia at 33 \u00b0C or targeted normothermia and early treatment of fever (37.8 \u00b0C or higher).Main outcomes and measuresFunctional outcome focusing on societal participation assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended ([GOSE] 1 to 8) and cognitive function assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ([MoCA] 0 to 30) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test ([SDMT] z scores). Higher scores represent better outcomes.ResultsAt 6 months, 836 of 939 survivors with a mean age of 60 (SD, 13) (range, 18 to 88) years (700 of 836 male [84%]) participated in the follow-up. There were no differences between the 2 intervention groups in functional outcome focusing on societal participation (GOSE score, odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.71-1.17; P\u2009=\u2009.46) or in cognitive function by MoCA (mean difference, 0.36; 95% CI,\u22120.33 to 1.05; P\u2009=\u2009.37) and SDMT (mean difference, 0.06; 95% CI,\u22120.16 to 0.27; P\u2009=\u2009.62). Limitations in societal participation (GOSE score less than 7) were common regardless of intervention (hypothermia, 178 of 415 [43%]; normothermia, 168 of 419 [40%]). Cognitive impairment was identified in 353 of 599 survivors (59%).ConclusionsIn this predefined analysis of comatose patients after OHCA, hypothermia did not lead to better functional outcome assessed with a focus on societal participation and cognitive function than management with normothermia. At 6 months, many survivors had not regained their pre-arrest activities and roles, and mild cognitive dysfunction was common.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02908308",

To address this problem, we take China's Photovoltaic Poverty Alleviation Project (PPAP) as an example to empirically study the benefits of large-scale PV deployment for alleviating poverty in its multiple dimensions and achieving regional sustainable development. We investigated its effect using a panel dataset of 71 pilot counties supported by PPAP in China from 2014 to 2017, with propensity score matching and difference-in-difference estimation as the main modeling tools. We found that PPAP can reduce multidimensional poverty on average by 3.0% in a county, benefiting sustainable livelihoods. In detail regarding multidimensional poverty alleviation, PPAP can effectively reduce the poverty level of economic capital, social capital, and human capital. However, it has a limited impact on physical and natural capital. Besides, state-designated poverty counties benefit more from PPAP than the non-poverty counties. Geographically, the poverty reduction effect of PPAP also shows strong regional heterogeneity, with the most substantial poverty alleviation effect in Northwest China. Our research will enhance the public's understanding of PPAP, promote the realization of Goal 1 on poverty reduction and Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy in SDGs, and provide a reference for policymakers for future decision-making, as well as for large-scale PV project deployment in other developing countries.",

However, both disorders have associated retinal pigment epithelial changes, poor night vision, visual field defects, and abnormal electroretinographic findings, which are not found in families with COL2A1-associated Stickler syndrome. In addition, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are uncommon in Wagner disease but occur in approximately 50% of patients with either Stickler syndrome or erosive vitreoretinopathy.\r\n\r\nObjectives: To identify the chromosomal location of the genes involved in Wagner disease and erosive vitreoretinopathy and to distinguish these conditions genetically from Stickler syndrome.\r\n\r\nMethods: Fifteen affected members of a family affected with erosive vitreoretinopathy and 24 affected descendants of the pedigree described by Wagner were genotyped with a set of short tandem repeat polymorphisms distributed across the genome.\r\n\r\nResults: Significant linkage was observed in each family between the disease phenotype and markers that map to chromosome 5q13-14. The highest lod score for the family affected with erosive vitreoretinopathy was 4.2 and was obtained with marker GATA3H06 (theta = 0). The highest lod score for the family affected with Wagner disease was 5.8 and was obtained with marker D5S815 (theta = 0). A candidate gene (cartilage link protein) that is known to lie near the linked interval was screened for mutations, but none was found in either family.\r\n\r\nConclusions: These data suggest that erosive vitreoretinopathy and Wagner disease are allelic disorders and demonstrate that they are genetically distinct from COL2A1-associated Stickler syndrome.",

At validation using the holdout set, our models (preoperative / postoperative) demonstrated a median Dice score of 0.71 (0.27) / 0 (0), a mean Jaccard score of 0.53\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21/0.030\u2009\u00b1\u20090.085 and a mean 95$^{th}$ percentile Hausdorff distance of 3.89\u2009\u00b1\u20091.96./12.199\u2009\u00b1\u20096.684. Pearson's correlation coefficient for volume correlation was 0.85 / 0.22 and -0.14 for extent of resection. Gross total resection was detected with a sensitivity of 66.67% and specificity of 36.36%.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nOur volumetry pipeline demonstrated its ability to accurately segment pituitary adenomas. This is highly valuable for lesion detection and evaluation of progression of pituitary incidentalomas. Postoperatively, however, objective and precise detection of residual tumor remains less successful. Larger datasets, more diverse data, and more elaborate modeling could potentially improve performance.",

We used reference equations adjusting for age, sex, and anthropometric measurements to define abnormal 6MWD.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOverall, 323 of 363 (89.0%) patients had at least one recorded 6MWD value at one year. At 3 months, the prevalence of abnormal 6MWD was 21.9% and at 12 months it was 18.3%. At 3 and 12 months, 58.8% and 52.1% with abnormal 6MWD did not report dyspnea, respectively. On average and during follow-up, 6MWD significantly improved with time, while the mMRC dyspnea scale did not. Abnormal 6MWD was associated with younger age (odds ratio per decade, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94), higher body mass index (1.10; 1.03-1.17), smoking (3.53; 1.34-9.31), intermediate- or high-risk PE (3.21; 1.21-8.56), and higher mMRC grading (2.28; 1.59-3.27).

Our objective was to investigate the association of patterns and degree of exercise limitation, as assessed by CPET, with clinical, echocardiographic and laboratory abnormalities and quality of life (QoL) after PE.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nIn a prospective cohort study of unselected consecutive all-comers with PE, survivors of the index acute event underwent 3- and 12-month follow-ups, including CPET. We defined cardiopulmonary limitation as ventilatory inefficiency or insufficient cardiocirculatory reserve. Deconditioning was defined as peak O$_{2}$ uptake (V'$_{O_{2}}$ ) <80% with no other abnormality.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOverall, 396 patients were included. At 3\u2005months, prevalence of cardiopulmonary limitation and deconditioning was 50.1% (34.7% mild/moderate; 15.4% severe) and 12.1%, respectively; at 12\u2005months, it was 44.8% (29.1% mild/moderate; 15.7% severe) and 14.9%, respectively. Cardiopulmonary limitation and its severity were associated with age (OR per decade 2.05, 95% CI 1.65-2.55), history of chronic lung disease (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.06-6.97), smoking (OR 5.87, 95% CI 2.44-14.15) and intermediate- or high-risk acute PE (OR 4.36, 95% CI 1.92-9.94).

The exclusion of patients with a poor prognosis from RCTs is negatively associated with the generalizability of research findings.\r\nObjective To compare the prognostic risk factors (PRFs) in patient samples of RCTs of face-to-face therapy (FTF) and internet-based therapy (IBT) for depression.\r\nData Sources PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, and reference lists of published meta-analyses were searched from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2021.Study SelectionRCTs that compared FTF (individual or group therapy) and IBT (guided or self-guided interventions) against a control (waitlist or treatment as usual) in adults with symptoms of depression were included.\r\nData Extraction and Synthesis Data were extracted by 2 independent observers. The Cochrane revised risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The study was preregistered with OSF Registries and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.\r\nMain Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the standardized mean difference (Hedges g effect size) in depressive symptoms at treatment termination (assessed with standard patient self-report questionnaires), with a positive standardized mean difference indicating larger improvements in the intervention compared with those in the control group. Meta-regression analyses were adjusted for the type of control group. Three preregistered and 2 exploratory sensitivity analyses were conducted. A prognostic risk index (PROG) was created that calculated the sum of 12 predefined individual indicators, with scores ranging from 0 to 12 and higher scores indicating that a sample comprised patients with poorer prognoses.\r\nResults This systematic review and meta-regression analysis identified 105 eligible RCTs that comprised 18 363 patients. In total, 48 studies (46%) examined FTF, and 57 studies (54%) examined IBT. The PROG was significantly higher in the RCTs of FTF than in the RCTs of IBT (FTF: mean [SD],\u20093.55 [1.75]; median [IQR], 3.5 [2.0-4.5]; IBT: mean [SD], 2.27 [1.66]; median [IQR],\u20092.0 [1.0-3.5]; z\u2009=\u2009\u22123.68, P\u2009&amp;lt;\u2009.001; Hedges g\u2009=\u20090.75; 95% CI, 0.36-1.15). A random-effects meta-regression analysis found no association of the PROG with the effect size. Sensitivity analyses with outliers excluded and accounting for risk of bias or small-study effects yielded mixed results on the association between the PROG and effect size.\r\nConclusions and Relevance The findings of this systematic review and meta-regression analysis suggest that samples of RCTs of FTF vs IBT differ with regard to PRFs. These findings have implications for the generalizability of the current evidence on IBT for depression. More RCTs of internet-based interventions with clinically representative samples are needed, and the reporting of PRFs must be improved.",

Dentitions of 18 adults and 22 subadults were investigated using non-destructive methods (micro-CT, macroscopic, radiographic). Extensive carious lesions were identified in seventeen adults and four subadults, and from this group one subadult and sixteen adults had antemortem tooth loss. Sixteen adults showed evidence of periodontal disease. Enamel hypoplastic (EH) defects were identified in fourteen adults and nine subadults. Many individuals with dental defects also had skeletal signs of comorbidities. South Australian individuals had the same percentage of carious lesions as the British sample (53%), more than other historic Australian samples, but less than a contemporary New Zealand sample. Over 50% of individuals from all the historic cemeteries had EH defects, suggesting systemic health insults during dental development were common during the 19th century. The overall oral health of the South Australian settlers was poor but, in some categories, (tooth wear, periapical abscess, periodontal disease), better than the other historic samples.",

However, even with timely clot removal, many stroke patients recover poorly. Leptomeningeal collaterals (LMCs) are pial anastomotic vessels with yet unknown functions. Utilizing a thrombin-based mouse model of stroke and the gold standard fibrinolytic treatment rt-PA, we here show that LMCs play a critical role in preserving vascular function in ischemic territories. We applied laser speckle contrast imaging, ultrafast ultrasound, and two-photon microscopy, to show that after thrombolysis, LMCs allow for gradual reperfusion resulting in small infarcts. On the contrary, in mice with poor LMCs, distal segments of recanalized arteries collapse and deleterious hyperemia causes hemorrhage and mortality. Accordingly, in stroke patients with poor collaterals undergoing thrombectomy, rapid reperfusion resulted in hemorrhagic transformation and unfavorable recovery. Thus, we identify LMCs as key components regulating reperfusion after stroke. Future therapeutic interventions should aim to enhance collateral function, allowing for gradual reperfusion of ischemic tissues after stroke.",

        "document": "Title: A multicenter phase II trial of anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes loaded with doxorubicin in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer\nAbstract: Advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive, but initially chemo-sensitive disease. The prognosis is poor and more than three quarters of patients experience progression 12\u00a0months after the initiation of conventional first-line chemotherapy. Approximately two thirds of TNBC express epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR). We have developed an anti-EGFR targeted nanocontainer drug by inserting anti-EGFR antibody fragments into the membrane of pegylated liposomes (anti-EGFR-ILs-dox). The payload consists of doxorubicin, a standard drug for TNBC. In a first-in-human phase I trial in 26 patients with various advanced solid malignancies, anti-EGFR-ILs-dox has shown little toxicity and encouraging efficacy. In this single-arm phase II trial, we assessed the efficacy of anti-EGFR-ILs-dox as first-line therapy in patients with advanced, EGFR\u2009+\u2009TNBC. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 12\u00a0months (PFS12m). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs). 48 patients received anti-EGFR-ILs-dox 50\u00a0mg/m$^{2}$ iv, on day one of a 28\u00a0days-cycle until progression. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for PFS12m was 13% (one-sided 90% CI 7%, 95% CI [5%, 25%]), median PFS was 3.5\u00a0months (95% CI 1.9, 5.4). The trial has not reached its primary endpoint. There were no new toxicity signals. Based on these results, anti-EGFR-ILs-dox should not be further developed for TNBC. It remains an open question whether anti-EGFR-ILs-dox would offer more opportunities in other EGFR-expressing malignancies, where targeting this receptor has already shown anticancer effects.Trial registration: This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02833766.

The soft tissue values were integrated into the profiles, and profile preferences were identified for each location. An ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test was used to compare the differences in mean preference in each location. A multivariable regression model was used to assess the effect of the demographics of the evaluator on preference.\r\nRESULTS: Thirteen profiles were ultimately analyzed. The mean for profile preference was significantly different across locations (P\u00a0< 0.0001). For evaluators in the United States and Lebanon, the most preferred profile had the original lip and original nose. In Switzerland and South Africa, retrusive lips, and a small and less upturned nose was most preferred. In Japan and Saudi Arabia, the most preferred profile had the original lip and a protrusive nose that was less upturned. A protrusive lip with a small, upturned nose was preferred in Turkey. Profile change (P\u00a0< 0.0001), location (P\u00a0< 0.0001), sex (P\u00a0< 0.0001), and race (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) were significant confounders; in contrast, age, education, and income were not significant.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Profile preference is different among the seven locations. For the most part, lay people prefer profiles within one SD from white norms. Also, an upturned nose is the least favored in most of the locations. Sex and race are also significant confounders.\r\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: An orthodontic treatment plan decision is affected by an individual's preference for their facial appearance. This study helps clinicians understand how racial and regional differences may affect patients' preferences and, therefore, their expectations for orthodontic treatment results.",

However, the majority of patients with an SSD do not show aggressive or criminal behavior. Yet, there is little research on clinical key features distinguishing offender from non-offender patients. Previous results point to poorer impulse control, higher levels of excitement, tension, and hostility, and worse overall cognitive functioning in offender populations. This study aimed to detect the most indicative distinguishing clinical features between forensic and general psychiatric patients with SSD based on the course of illness and the referenced hospitalization in order to facilitate a better understanding of the relationship between violent and non-violent offenses and SSD.\r\n\r\nMethods: Our study population consisted of forensic psychiatric patients (FPPs) with a diagnosis of F2x (ICD-10) or 295.x (ICD-9) and a control group of general psychiatric patients (GPPs) with the same diagnosis, totaling 740 patients. Patients were evaluated regarding their medical (and, if applicable, criminal) history and the referenced psychiatric hospitalization. Supervised machine learning (ML) was used to exploratively evaluate predictor variables and their interplay and rank them in accordance with their discriminative power.\r\n\r\nResults: Out of 194 possible predictor variables, the following 6 turned out to have the highest influence on the model: olanzapine equivalent at discharge from the referenced hospitalization, a history of antipsychotic prescription, a history of antidepressant, benzodiazepine or mood stabilizer prescription, medication compliance, outpatient treatment(s) in the past, and the necessity of compulsory measures. Out of the seven algorithms applied, gradient boosting emerged as the most suitable, with an AUC of 0.86 and a balanced accuracy of 77.5%.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: Our study aimed to identify the most influential illness-related predictors, distinguishing between FPP and GPP with SSD, thus shedding light on key differences between the two groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare a homogenous sample of FPP and GPP with SSD regarding their symptom severity and course of illness using highly sophisticated statistical approaches with the possibility of evaluating the interplay of all factors at play.",

Given data limitations we employ a \u2018next best\u2019 approach to apply this framework and measure local government performance by combining a weighted \u2018quality of reporting\u2019 measure with selected available measures on political processes and internal operations, and policy implementation, so as to construct a composite index for local government performance (LGI). We also look at the relationship between our performance indices and other indices of local government performance in Ghana, as well as poverty headcounts. We find that, on average, urban districts perform better than their rural counterparts and also districts located in the southern half of Ghana perform better. Our constructed composite index is positively correlated with indices from Ghana\u2019s district league tables. It has a negative relationship with poverty headcount in districts, indicating that districts with lower poverty incidence are more effective and responsive to their citizens. The findings provide a snapshot of institutional performance across Ghana\u2019s districts, and offer a more comprehensive basis for considering variations in subnational institutional performance, including the effects of decentralisation than previous studies of Ghana \u2013 or indeed African countries more broadly.",

In the last decades advancements in neonatal care have led to a general decrease in adverse outcomes. \r\nAim: To assess trends of mortality and neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in a recent Swiss cohort of very preterm infants with grade 3 intraventricular haemorrhage (G3-IVH) and periventricular haemorrhagic infarction (PVHI). \r\nMethods: In this retrospective population-based cohort study, rates of mortality, and NDI at 2 years corrected age were reported in infants born at 24\u201329 weeks gestational age (GA) in Switzerland in 2002\u20132014, with G3-IVH and/or PVHI. \r\nResults: Out of 4956 eligible infants, 462 (9%) developed G3-IVH (n = 172) or PVHI (n = 290).

In 2002\u20132014, no change in rates of mortality (G3-IVH, p = 0.845; PVHI, p = 0.386) or NDI in survivors (G3-IVH, p = 0.756; PVHI, p = 0.588) were observed, while mean GA decreased (G3-IVH, p = 0.020; PVHI, p = 0.004). Multivariable regression analysis showed a strong association of G3-IVH and PVHI for both mortality and NDI. Death occurred after withdrawal of care in 81% of cases. \r\nConclusion: In 2002\u20132014, rates of mortality and NDI in very preterm born infants with major brain lesions did not change. The significant decrease in mean GA and changing hospital policies over this time span may factor into the interpretation of these results.",

        "document": "Title: Machine learning to predict poor school performance in paediatric survivors of intensive care: a population-based cohort study\nAbstract: Purpose: Whilst survival in paediatric critical care has improved, clinicians lack tools capable of predicting long-term outcomes. We developed a machine learning model to predict poor school outcomes in children surviving intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Population-based study of children < 16 years requiring ICU admission in Queensland, Australia, between 1997 and 2019. Failure to meet the National Minimum Standard (NMS) in the National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) assessment during primary and secondary school was the primary outcome. Routine ICU information was used to train machine learning classifiers. Models were trained, validated and tested using stratified nested cross-validation. \r\nResults: 13,957 childhood ICU survivors with 37,200 corresponding NAPLAN tests after a median follow-up duration of 6 years were included. 14.7%, 17%, 15.6% and 16.6% failed to meet NMS in school grades 3, 5, 7 and 9. The model demonstrated an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.8 (standard deviation SD, 0.01), with 51% specificity to reach 85% sensitivity [relative Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (rel-AUPRC) 3.42, SD 0.06]. Socio-economic status, illness severity, and neurological, congenital, and genetic disorders contributed most to the predictions. In children with no comorbidities admitted between 2009 and 2019, the model achieved a AUROC of 0.77 (SD 0.03) and a rel-AUPRC of 3.31 (SD 0.42). \r\nConclusion: A machine learning model using data available at time of ICU discharge predicted failure to meet minimum educational requirements at school age. Implementation of this prediction tool could assist in prioritizing patients for follow-up and targeting of rehabilitative measures.

ESOS accounts for less than 1% of all soft tissue sarcomas and exhibits an aggressive behavior with a high propensity for local recurrence and distant metastasis. Despite advances in treatment, the prognosis for ESOS remains poor, with a five-year survival rate of less than 50% and 27% for metastatic patients. Ex vivo models derived from patient samples are critical tools for studying rare diseases with poor prognoses, such as ESOS, and identifying potential new treatment strategies. In this work, we established a novel ESOS ex vivo sarco-sphere model from a metastatic lesion to the dermis for research and functional testing purposes. The ex vivo cell model accurately recapitulated the native tumor, as evidenced by histomorphology and molecular profiles. Through a functional screening approach, we were able to identify novel individual anti-cancer drug sensitivities for different drugs such as romidepsin, miverbresib and to multiple kinase inhibitors. Overall, our new ESOS ex vivo cell model represents a valuable tool for investigating disease mechanisms and answering basic and translational research questions.",

To examine this question, we exploit geographic variation in aging across U.S. counties. We establish that banks with higher exposure to aging counties increase loan-to-income ratios. Laxer lending standards lead to higher nonperforming loans during downturns, suggesting higher credit risk. Inspecting the mechanism shows that aging drives risk-taking through two contemporaneous channels: deposit inflows due to seniors\u2019 propensity to save in deposits; and depressed local investment opportunities due to seniors\u2019 lower credit demand.

However, little is known about what anesthesiologists know and think about AI in this context. This is important because the successful introduction of new technologies depends on the understanding and cooperation of end users. We sought to investigate how much anesthesiologists know about AI and what they think about the introduction of AI-based technologies into the clinical setting. In order to better understand what anesthesiologists think of AI, we recruited 21 anesthesiologists from 2 university hospitals for face-to-face structured interviews. The interview transcripts were subdivided sentence-by-sentence into discrete statements, and statements were then grouped into key themes. Subsequently, a survey of closed questions based on these themes was sent to 70 anesthesiologists from 3 university hospitals for rating. In the interviews, the base level of knowledge of AI was good at 86 of 90 statements (96%), although awareness of the potential applications of AI in anesthesia was poor at only 7 of 42 statements (17%). Regarding the implementation of AI in anesthesia, statements were split roughly evenly between pros (46 of 105, 44%) and cons (59 of 105, 56%). Interviewees considered that AI could usefully be used in diverse tasks such as risk stratification, the prediction of vital sign changes, or as a treatment guide. The validity of these themes was probed in a follow-up survey of 70 anesthesiologists with a response rate of 70%, which confirmed an overall positive view of AI in this group. Anesthesiologists hold a range of opinions, both positive and negative, regarding the application of AI in their field of work. Survey-based studies do not always uncover the full breadth of nuance of opinion amongst clinicians. Engagement with specific concerns, both technical and ethical, will prove important as this technology moves from research to the clinic.",

Yet, it is still unclear how policies that seek to tackle deprivation, such as anti-poverty schemes, affect political participation in targeted constituencies: Do they mobilize new citizens (mobilization) or keep engaged those with the habit of voting (mitigation)? I theoretically distinguish between these two mechanisms by focusing on cash transfers, the most widely adopted anti-poverty scheme worldwide. Empirically, I evaluate the Renda B\u00e1sica de Cidadania, the largest unconditional cash transfer in Latin America, which allows for isolating the effect of cash payments on voting behavior. Estimates from a difference-in-differences design reveal a three percentage points increase (a net growth of 4%) in voter turnout in posttreatment elections. Leveraging municipal-level data in a synthetic control method approach, I show that a mitigation mechanism induces this effect, i.e., the payment of monthly cash transfers reduced the incentives to abstain in elections.",

We provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the role of income inequality for trade that allows distinguishing within- and between-country inequality. To bring differences in the willingness to pay of differentially rich consumers to the forefront of the analysis, we deviate from the canonical model by replacing the standard CES preferences with non-homothetic 0-1 preferences. We characterize and numerically solve the trade equilibrium for a discrete labor endowment distribution with several consumer-income groups. Our model predicts trade intensity to be increasing in the income distribution overlap, which is our preferred proxy for demand similarity. Our model, therefore, provides a theoretical foundation for the Linder hypothesis, that bilateral trade volume is increasing in the similarity of demand structure between two countries. Furthermore, our model predicts a Manhattan effect, capturing that poor consumers are badly off if they are a small minority in a predominantly rich country due to the high price level for basic products.",

For this, I exploit the recent introduction of the L\u00e9man Express, a suburban train service in the Greater Geneva area. The new line seamlessly connects the Swiss and the French side of the agglomeration, resulting in a substantial travel time reduction. I document locally concentrated construction booms and increasing prices at locations benefiting from the new service about two years in anticipation of the opening. I study the impact of the anticipated commuting cost decrease on residential mobility flows and discuss the resulting changes in neighborhood composition. Locations near soon well-connected stations experience a shift towards affluent, home-owning cross-border workers resulting in a gentrification push for these historically predominantly poor neighborhoods. This is largely driven by inflows from adjacent areas and internal relocations whereas trans-border relocation flows remain unimportant.",

Antiplatelet use is one of the factors that has been related to early rebleed and worse outcome after aSAH. Thrombocyte transfusion overcomes the inhibitory effects of antiplatelet agents by increasing the number of functional thrombocytes, but its impact on the rebleed rate and clinical outcome remains unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of thrombocyte transfusion on rebleeding and clinical outcome in patients with aSAH and prehemorrhage antiplatelet use, considering confounding factors.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nData were prospectively collected at a single tertiary reference center for aSAH in Zurich, Switzerland. Patients with aSAH and prehemorrhage antiplatelet use were divided into \"thrombocyte transfusion\" and \"nontransfusion\" groups based on whether they did or did not receive any thrombocyte transfusion in the acute stage of aSAH after hospital admission and before the exclusion of the bleeding source. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the impact of thrombocyte transfusion on the rebleed rate and on clinical outcome (defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1-3) was calculated.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOne hundred fifty-seven patients were included, 87 (55.4%) of whom received thrombocyte transfusion. Eighteen (11.5%) of 157 patients had a rebleed during the hospital stay. The rebleed risk was 6.9% in the thrombocyte transfusion group and 17.1% in the nontransfusion group. After adjusting for confounders, thrombocyte transfusion showed evidence for a reduction in the rebleed rate (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.87). Fifty-seven patients (36.3%) achieved a poor outcome at 6 months' follow-up. Among those 57 patients, 31 (54.4%) underwent at least one thrombocyte transfusion. Thrombocyte transfusion was not associated with poor clinical outcome at 6 months' follow-up (aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.39-2.15).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThrombocyte transfusion in patients with aSAH and prehemorrhage antiplatelet use is independently associated with a reduction in rebleeds but shows no impact on clinical outcome at 6 months' follow-up. Larger and randomized studies are needed to investigate the impact of thrombocyte transfusion on rebleed and outcome.",

The standard of care for this cohort is only partially defined and survival remains poor. The aims of this study were to reveal current practice of tumor-specific therapy and supportive care, and to identify predictors for survival in this cohort.\r\nMethods: Patients aged 80 years or older at the time of glioblastoma diagnosis were retrospectively identified in 6 clinical centers in Switzerland and France. Demographics, clinical parameters, and survival outcomes were annotated from patient charts. Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to identify parameters associated with survival.\r\nResults: Of 107 patients, 45 were diagnosed by biopsy, 30 underwent subtotal resection, and 25 had gross total resection. In 7 patients, the extent of resection was not specified. Postoperatively, 34 patients did not receive further tumor-specific treatment. Twelve patients received radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide, but only 2 patients had maintenance temozolomide therapy. Fourteen patients received temozolomide alone, 35 patients received radiotherapy alone, 1 patient received bevacizumab, and 1 took part in a clinical trial. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.3 months and median overall survival (OS) was 4.2 months. Among patients who received any postoperative treatment, median PFS was 3.9 months and median OS was 7.2 months. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) \u226570%, gross total resection, and combination therapy were associated with better outcomes. The median time spent hospitalized was 30 days, accounting for 23% of the median OS. End-of-life care was mostly provided by nursing homes (n\u2005=\u200520; 32%) and palliative care wards (n\u2005=\u200516; 26%).\r\nConclusions: In this cohort of very old patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, a large proportion was treated with best supportive care. Treatment beyond surgery and, in particular, combined modality treatment were associated with longer OS and may be considered for selected patients even at higher ages.",

According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) consortium, at least 171\u2009million individuals were affected with AD in 2019, corresponding to 2.23% of the world population, with age\u2010standardized prevalence and incidence rates that were relatively stable from 1990 to 2019. Based on the panel experience, most AD cases are mild\u2010to\u2010moderate. Without parallel data on disease prevalence and severity, the GBD data are difficult to interpret in many regions. This gap is particularly important in countries with limited medical infrastructure, but indirect evidence suggests a significant burden of AD in low\u2010and\u2010medium resource settings, especially urban areas. The Singapore roundtable was an opportunity to compare experiences in World Bank category 1 (Madagascar and Mali), 3 (Brazil, China) and 4 (Australia, Germany, Qatar, USA, Singapore, Japan) countries. The panel concluded that current AD guidelines are not adapted for low resource settings and a more pragmatic approach, as developed by WHO for skin NTDs, would be advisable for minimal access to moisturizers and topical corticosteroids. The panel also recommended prioritizing prevention studies, regardless of the level of existing resources. For disease long\u2010term control in World Bank category 3 and most category 4 countries, the main problem is not access to drugs for most mild\u2010to\u2010moderate cases, but rather poor compliance due to insufficient time at visits. Collaboration with WHO, patient advocacy groups and industry may promote global change, improve capacity training and fight current inequalities. Finally, optimizing management of AD and its comorbidities needs more action at the primary care level, because reaching specialist care is merely aspirational in most settings. Primary care empowerment with store and forward telemedicine and algorithms based on augmented intelligence is a future goal.",

The first systemic treatment to significantly prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with mUM was tebentafusp, a bispecific protein that can redirect T-cells to gp-100 positive cells. However, the objective response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) may underestimate the clinical impact of tebentafusp. As metabolic response assessed by PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) has been reported to better correlate with clinical outcome, we here compared the patterns of radiological and morphological responses in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with mUM treated with tebentafusp. In the 19 enrolled patients, RECIST showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 10%, median progression-free survival of 2.8 months (95% CI 2.5\u20138.4), and median OS (mOS) of 18.8 months. In 10 patients, where both RECIST and PERCIST evaluation was available, the ORR was 10% for both; however, the PFS was longer for PERCIST compared to RECIST, 3.1 and 2.4 months, respectively. A poor agreement between the criteria was observed at all assessments (Cohen\u2019s kappa \u22640), yet they differed significantly only at the first on-treatment imaging (P\u2005=\u20050.037). Elevated baseline LDH and age were associated with an increased risk for RECIST progression, while lymphocyte decrease after the first infusions correlated to reduced risk of RECIST progression. Detectable ctDNA at baseline did not correlate with progression. Early response to tebentafusp may be incompletely captured by conventional imaging, leading to a need to consider both tumor morphology and metabolism.",

Despite more than 250 clinical trials aimed to treat children diagnosed with DMG, no curative therapies currently exist for this patient population. A major obstacle has been the intact blood brain barrier (BBB) which prevents most therapeutics from crossing into the tumor bed. Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging, noninvasive medical technology which has been shown in both preclinical and clinical research to disrupt the blood brain barrier safely and temporarily. FUS blood brain barrier opening has been studied in combination with chemotherapies in preclinical DMG models, and this technology is now being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. Focused ultrasound has additional mechanisms of action, including sonodynamic therapy and radiation sensitization, that hold promise as future DMG therapies as well. This paper, largely based off the proceedings from a workshop held by the Focused Ultrasound Foundation in October of 2021, summarizes the current state of the field of focused ultrasound for DIPG/DMG, including preclinical, technical, and clinical summaries in addition to recommended next steps for continued advancement of the game changing technology of Focused Ultrasound.",

The goal of this study was to examine the efficacy of contemporary therapy, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission (CR1).\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nInduction failure (IF) was defined as the persistence of at least 5% bone marrow (BM) lymphoblasts and/or extramedullary disease after 4-6 weeks of induction chemotherapy. Disease features and clinical outcomes were reported in 325 of 6,167 (5%) patients age 21 years and younger treated in 14 cooperative study groups between 2000 and 2018.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nWith a median follow-up period of 6.4 years (range, 0.3-17.9 years), the 10-year overall survival (OS) was 54.7% (SE = 2.9), which is significantly higher than the 27.6% (SE = 2.9) observed in the historical cohort from 1985 to 2000. There was no significant impact of sex, age, white blood cell count, central nervous system disease status, T-cell maturity, or BM disease burden at EOI on OS. Postinduction complete remission (CR) was achieved in 93% of patients with 10-year OS of 59.6% (SE = 3.1%) and disease-free survival (DFS) of 56.3% (SE = 3.1%). Among the patients who achieved CR, 72% underwent HSCT and their 10-year DFS (with a 190-day landmark) was significantly better than nontransplanted patients (63.8% [SE = 3.6] v 45.5% [SE = 7.1]; P = .005), with OS of 66.2% (SE = 3.6) versus 50.8% (SE = 6.8); P = .10, respectively.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOutcomes for patients age 21 years and younger with T-ALL and IF have improved in the contemporary treatment era with a DFS benefit among those undergoing HSCT in CR1. However, outcomes still lag considerably behind those who achieve remission at EOI, warranting investigation of new treatment approaches.",

Successful treatment strategies are currently lacking and there remains an unmet need for novel therapies for these patients. We report here the results of a phase 1 study of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) and explore the safety of this oncolytic immunotherapy for the treatment of pediatric patients with advanced non-central nervous system tumors.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nT-VEC was delivered by intralesional injection at 10$^{6}$ plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml on the first day, followed by 10$^{8}$ PFU/ml on the first day of week 4 and every 2 weeks thereafter. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability as assessed by the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary objectives included efficacy indicated by response and survival per modified immune-related response criteria simulating the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRC-RECIST).\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nFifteen patients were enrolled into two cohorts based on age: cohort A1 (n\u2009=\u200913) 12 to \u226421 years old (soft-tissue sarcoma, n\u2009=\u20097; bone sarcoma, n\u2009=\u20093; neuroblastoma, n\u2009=\u20091; nasopharyngeal carcinoma, n\u2009=\u20091; and melanoma, n\u2009=\u20091) and cohort B1 (n\u2009=\u20092) 2 to <12 years old (melanoma, n\u2009=\u20092). Overall, patients received treatment for a median (range) of 5.1 (0.1, 39.4) weeks. No DLTs were observed during the evaluation period. All patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 53.3% of patients reported grade \u22653 TEAEs. Overall, 86.7% of patients reported treatment-related TEAEs. No complete or partial responses were observed, and three patients (20%) overall exhibited stable disease as the best response.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nT-VEC was tolerable as assessed by the observation of no DLTs. The safety data were consistent with the patients' underlying cancer and the known safety profile of T-VEC from studies in the adult population.

Furthermore, poor data reporting and sharing, the absence of standardized metrics for outcome evaluation, and the lack of consensus definitions of success and failure have hampered the development of a \"transplantation culture\" on a global scale. We completed a 2-round online modified Delphi process with 35 international face transplant stakeholders, including surgeons, clinicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, ethicists, policymakers, and researchers, with a representation of 10 of the 19 face transplant teams that had already performed the procedure and 73% of face transplants. Themes addressed included patient assessment and selection, indications, social support networks, clinical framework, surgical considerations, data on patient progress and outcomes, definitions of success and failure, public image and perception, and financial sustainability. The presented recommendations are the product of a shared commitment of face transplant teams to foster the development of face transplantation and are aimed at providing a gold standard of practice and policy.",

Associations between these factors and the patients\u2019 sex, LLST timing, and presence of AD were evaluated.\r\nResults: Out of 2975 patients, 12% of men and 10.5% of women underwent LLST (p=0.30). Women, compared to men, more commonly received withdrawal instead of withholding of life sustaining treatments (57.5 vs. 45.1%, p=0.028) despite comparable disease severity. Women receiving LLST were older (73\u00b111.7 vs. 69\u00b114.9 years, p=0.005) and often without a partner (43.8 vs. 25.8%, p=0.001) compared to men. AD were associated with female sex and early LLST, but not with an increased in-hospital mortality (57.1 vs. 75.2% of patients with and without AD respectively).\r\nConclusions: In patients receiving LLST, the presence of an AD was associated with an increase of early LLST, but not with an increased in-hospital mortality. This supports the notion that the presence of an AD is primarily an expression of the patients\u2019 will but does not per se predestine the patient for an unfavorable outcome.\r\nKey words: Redirection of Care, Palliation, Neurocritical Care, Sex Differences",

We investigated whether poor global sleep quality is associated with impaired coronary microvascular function in male physicians, a professional group at increased risk for burnout.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nStudy participants were 30 male physicians with clinical burnout and 30 controls without burnout defined by the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Global sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Endothelium-dependent (cold pressor test) and endothelium-independent (adenosine challenge) coronary microvascular function were quantified with myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography. In multivariable analyses, the interaction between burnout and the PSQI global score was regressed on measures of coronary microvascular function, adjusting for age, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and main effects of burnout and PSQI score.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score > 5) was 40% in the burnout group and 10% in the control group. Adjusting for covariates, burnout-by-global PSQI score interactions were observed for myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest (r partial = -.30, p = .025), endothelium-dependent coronary flow reserve (r partial = -.26, p = .062), MBF response (r partial = -.30, p = .028), and hyperemic MBF (r partial = -.34, p = -.012). The global PSQI score was inversely associated with these MBF measures in the burnout group relative to the control group. No significant interactions emerged for endothelium-independent MBF.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nIn male physicians with occupational burnout, poor global sleep quality was associated with reduced endothelium-dependent coronary microvascular function, suggesting a mechanism by which burnout may affect cardiovascular health.",

Established multi- and single-item measures were used as predicting, intervening and outcome variables. Relative frequencies stratified for nurses, physicians and therapists were calculated to estimate and differentiate the size of the phenomena under study. Furthermore, crosstabulations, as well as multivariate regression analyses, were performed to explore the associations of interest.\r\n\r\n              \r\nResults\r\nEvery fifth to sixth nurse and every seventh to eighth physician reported having had intentions to change jobs or leave the profession within the past year. These intentions become much more prevalent across all health professions when one or even two or more different forms of violence and/or discrimination at work are experienced and reported. Accordingly, the relative risks for intending to quit one\u2019s job or leave one\u2019s profession increase significantly and steadily with a growing number (1, 2\u2009+) of different experienced forms of violence and/or discrimination at work compared to the reference group of those who are nonaffected (aOR from 2.5 up to 5.4). This fairly strong association was only slightly reduced (aOR from 2.1 to 4.0) when work climate was additionally taken into account as a potential intervening variable. Although work climate only partly accounted for the association under study, a poor work climate was an additional strong predictor and independent risk factor for intentions to turnover (aOR\u2009=\u20096.4) or leave the profession (aOR\u2009=\u20094.2).\r\n              \r\nConclusions\r\nExperiences of workplace violence and discrimination and the resulting poor work climate both together and independent of each other seem to be important causes of job changes and career endings among healthcare workers in Switzerland.",

These children are typically considered resilient. The objective of this study was to follow up such resilient children in adulthood to characterize mental health status, substance use, and functional outcomes.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nThe analysis was based on the prospective, representative Great Smoky Mountains Study (N=1,420). Participants were assessed for psychiatric disorders and exposure to adversity with the structured Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment interview up to eight times in childhood (ages 9\u201316; 6,674 observations). In total, 1,266 participants (86.3%) were followed up in adulthood at ages 25 and 30 to assess psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and functional outcomes.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nSeventy-five percent of the sample had met criteria for a psychiatric disorder or displayed subthreshold psychiatric problems by age 16. The number of adverse childhood experiences was strongly associated with childhood psychiatric status. Of children exposed to multiple adversities (N=650), 12.2% (N=63) did not display psychiatric problems. This group meets common definitions of childhood resilience. In adulthood, these individuals showing childhood resilience had greater risk of anxiety (risk ratio=2.9, 95% CI=1.0\u20139.1) and depressive (risk ratio=4.5, 95% CI=1.1\u201316.7) disorders, as well as worse physical health (means ratio=0.7, 95% CI=0.5\u20130.9) and financial or educational functioning (means ratio=0.6, 95% CI=0.5\u20130.7), compared with individuals exposed to fewer childhood adversities. These individuals showing childhood resilience did not have elevated risk for substance use disorders.\r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\nResilience to childhood adversity was uncommon. Individuals who appeared resilient in childhood were at risk for delayed poorer outcomes in adulthood. Public health efforts should prioritize minimizing early adversity exposure over promoting resilience.",

Outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, poor 3\u2010month functional outcome (modified Rankin scale 3\u20136) and mortality. We compared: (i) IVT >4.5\u20139\u2009hours versus 0\u20134.5\u2009hours after stroke onset and (ii) within the >4.5\u20139\u2009hours group baseline advanced neuroimaging (computed tomography perfusion, magnetic resonance perfusion or magnetic resonance diffusion\u2010weighted imaging fluid\u2010attenuated inversion recovery) versus non\u2010advanced neuroimaging.ResultsOf 15,827 patients, 663 (4.2%) received IVT >4.5\u20139\u2009hours and 15,164 (95.8%) within 4.5\u2009hours after stroke onset.

What is the joint role of preferences and beliefs about inequality for support for redistribution? We study these questions in a staggered experiment with a representative sample of the Swiss population conducted in the context of a vote on a highly redistributive policy proposal. Our sample comprises a majority of inequality averse subjects, a sizeable group of altruistic subjects, and a minority of predominantly selfish subjects. Irrespective of preference types, individuals vastly overestimate the extent of income inequality. An information intervention successfully corrects these large misperceptions for all types, but essentially does not affect aggregate support for redistribution. These results hide, however, important heterogeneity because the effects of beliefs about inequality for demand for redistribution are preference-dependent: only affluent inequality averse individuals, but not the selfish and altruistic ones, significantly reduce their support for redistribution. These findings cast a new light on the seemingly puzzling result that, in the aggregate, large changes in beliefs about inequality often do not translate into changes in demand for redistribution.",

Kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, are the epitome of health inequity. Kidney disease risk and outcomes are strongly associated with inequities that occur across the entire clinical course of disease. Insufficient investment across the spectrum of kidney health and kidney care is a fundamental source of inequity. In addition, social and structural inequities, including inequities in access to primary health care, education and preventative strategies, are major risk factors for, and contribute to, poorer outcomes for individuals living with kidney diseases. Access to affordable kidney care is also highly inequitable, resulting in financial hardship and catastrophic health expenditure for the most vulnerable. Solutions to these injustices require leadership and political will. The nephrology community has an important role in advocacy and in identifying and implementing solutions to dismantle inequities that affect kidney health.",

However, hedonic processing of foods consumes voluntary attention. We therefore checked whether the interaction between hedonic appetite and attentional abilities is associated with poorer dietary self-control. Using the Power of Food Scale (PFS) we measured hedonic appetite in two samples of young adults living in cities. In Study 1 (380 participants) poor dietary self-control and attentional abilities were measured by the Uncontrolled Eating subscale of Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire and the Attentional Control Scale, respectively. In Study 2, 49 participants rated the healthiness and tastiness of foods. In the incentivized series of computerized trials, dietary self-control was defined as choosing a healthier over a tastier food item. Attentional abilities were computed as the ratio of mean to standard deviation of response time in a memory task check (a presented digit was checked against a memorized digit). The interaction between the PFS and attentional abilities was associated with poorer dietary self-control (Studies 1\u20132). The strength of the positive association between attentional abilities and self-control decreased with a PFS score, with no association (Study 1) and the negative association (Study 2) for high-PFS individuals. The strength of the negative association between the PFS and dietary self-control increased with attentional abilities, with no association for individuals with low attentional abilities in Study 2. The interplay between attentional skills and hedonic appetite can be harmful for dietary self-control in young adults. If hedonic appetite is strong enough, attentional abilities may be unfavorable for dietary self-control.",

Standard oral iron therapy often results in intestinal irritation with associated side effects and premature discontinuation of therapy, therefore, optimal oral iron therapy with sufficient iron absorption and minimal side effects is desirable.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Thirty-six iron-deficient non-anaemic premenopausal women (serum ferritin \u226430 ng/ml, haemoglobin \u2265117 g/l) with normal body mass index (BMI) and no hypermenorrhea received 6 mg of elemental oral iron (corresponding to 18.6 mg ferrous sulphate) twice daily for 8 weeks.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Participants treated with low-dose iron had an average age of 28 years and a BMI of 21 kg/m2. Their serum ferritin and haemoglobin increased significantly from 18 ng/ml to 33 ng/ml (p <0.001) and from 135 g/l to 138 g/l (p = 0.014), respectively. Systolic blood pressure increased from 114 mmHg to 120 mmHg (p = 0.003). Self-reported health status improved after 8 weeks (p <0.001) and only one woman reported gastrointestinal side effects (3%).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: This prospective open-label single-arm trial shows that oral iron treatment of 6 mg of elemental iron twice daily over 8 weeks is effective in iron-deficient non-anaemic women. Due to the negligible side effects, low-dose iron treatment is a valuable therapeutic option for iron-deficient non-anaemic women with normal BMI and menstruation. Further placebo-controlled studies with a larger number of participants are needed to confirm these results.\r\n\r\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04636060",

We propose a novel, standardized method of measuring overhang distance in patients following primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) on computed tomography (CT) images after multiplanar reformation and compare it to a previously proposed measurement method on sagittal CT images.\r\n\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\n\r\nThis retrospective study included patients who underwent primary THA with an anterior approach. Patients with cup overhang (CO) and iliopsoas impingement (IPI) were identified by clinical and imaging data. Uncorrected overhang distance (OD$_{u}$) was evaluated on orthogonal sagittal CT images while corrected overhang distance (OD$_{c}$) was evaluated on reformatted sagittal CT images corrected for pelvic rotation and aligned with the plane of the cup face.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nOut of 220 patients with THA, 23 patients (10.4%) with CO and 16 patients (7.3%) with IPI were identified. CO was significantly associated to IPI (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The inter- and intrareader agreement was almost perfect for OD$_{c}$ (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.822, \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.850), whereas it was fair and moderate for OD$_{u}$ (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.391, \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.455), respectively. The discriminative ability of OD$_{c}$ was excellent (area under the curve (AUC)\u2009=\u20090.909 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.784-1.000)) in the receiver operating characteristic analysis. Conversely, AUC for OD$_{u}$ was poor, measuring 0.677 (95% CI 0.433-0.921).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe implemented a novel measurement method for CT images reformatted at the plane of the cup face to assess overhang distance in patients with CO following THA.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT\r\n\r\nWhile further validation is necessary, the proposed method is characterized by its high reproducibility and might be used to predict the occurrence of iliopsoas impingement in patients with cup overhang following total hip arthroplasty.\r\n\r\nKEY POINTS\r\n\r\n\u2022 A novel, standardized method of measuring cup overhang distance in patients following primary total hip arthroplasty on CT images is proposed. \u2022 Cup overhang was associated to iliopsoas impingement.

However, whether such relationships are inevitable and should be expected to impact the health of small-scale societies as they become more market-integrated is less clear.MethodologyHere, using mixed-effect models, we explore the relationship between health, wealth, wealth inequality and health inequalities in a small-scale foraging population from the Philippines, the Agta.ResultsAcross 11 camps, we find small to moderate degrees of wealth inequality (maximal Gini Coefficient 0.44) which is highest in the most permanent camps, where individuals engage more heavily in the formal market. However, in both adults (n = 161) and children (n = 215), we find little evidence that either wealth or wealth inequality associates with ill health, except for one measure of nutritional condition\u2014red blood cell count.Conclusions and implicationsWe interpret these results in the light of high levels of cooperation among the Agta which may buffer against the detrimental effects of wealth inequality documented in industrial and post-industrial societies. We observe little intergenerational wealth transmission, highlighting the fluid nature of wealth, and thus wealth inequality, particularly in mobile communities. The deterioration of nutritional status, as indicated by red blood cell counts, requires further investigation before concluding the Agta\u2019s extensive cooperation networks may be beginning to breakdown in the face of increasing inequality.",

Real-life data are a unique approach to reflect the reality of PM epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis in Europe. METHODS: A joint analysis of the European Thoracic Oncology Platform Mesoscape and the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) databases was performed to better understand the characteristics and epidemiology of PM, including histologic subtype, staging, and treatment. Overall survival (OS) was assessed, adjusting for parameters of clinical interest. RESULTS: The analysis included 2766 patients (Mesoscape: 497/10 centers/ESTS: 2269/77 centers). The primary histologic subtype was epithelioid (71%), with 57% patients on stages III to IV. Within Mesoscape, the patients received either multimodality (59%) or palliative intention treatment (41%). The median follow-up was 47.2 months, on the basis of 1103 patients (Mesoscape: 491/ESTS: 612), with 823 deaths, and median OS was 17.4 months. In multivariable analysis, female sex, epithelioid subtype, and lower stage were associated with longer OS, when stratifying by cohort, age, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status. Within Mesoscape, multimodality treatment including surgery was predictive of longer OS (hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.56, 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.69), adjusting for sex, histologic subtype, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status. Overall, surgical candidates with a macroscopic complete resection had a significantly longer median OS compared with patients with R2 (25.2 m versus 16.4 m; log-rank p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This combined European Thoracic Oncology Platform/ESTS database analysis offers one of the largest databases with detailed clinical and pathologic outcome. Our finding reflects a benefit for selected patients that undergo multimodality treatment, including macroscopic complete resection, and represents a valuable resource to inform the epidemiology and treatment options for individual patients.",

Given past evidence of poor engagement with telemental health among men, this mixed-methods study examined Australian men\u2019s use of, and experiences with telemental health services relative to face-to-face care during the pandemic. A community sample of Australian-based men (N = 387; age M = 47.5 years, SD = 15.0 years) were recruited via Facebook advertising, and completed an online survey comprising quantitative items and open-response qualitative questions with the aim of better understanding men\u2019s experiences with telemental healthcare services. In total, 62.3% (n = 241) of participants reported experience with telemental health, and regression analyses revealed those who engaged with telemental health were on average younger, more likely to be gay and university educated. Men who had used telemental health were, on average, more satisfied with their therapy experience than those who had face-to-face therapy. Among those who had telemental healthcare, marginally lower satisfaction was observed among regional/rural based relative to urban men, and those who had to wait longer than 2 months to commence therapy. Qualitative findings highlighted positive aspects of telemental healthcare including comfort with accessing therapy from familiar home environments and the convenience and accessibility of telemental health alongside competing commitments and COVID-19 restrictions. Conversely, drawbacks included technical limitations such as crosstalk impeding therapeutic progress, disconnects and audio-visual lag-times and the \u2019impersonal\u2019 nature of telemental healthcare services. Findings broadly signal COVID-19 induced shifts norming of the use of virtual therapy services, with clear scope for improvement in the delivery of therapeutic practice using digital modalities, especially among help-seeking men.",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is potentially curative, but initially reported outcomes were poor. JAK inhibitors (JAKi) offer a targeted treatment option that may be an alternative or bridge to HSCT. However, data on their current use, treatment efficacy and adverse events are limited.\r\n\r\nObjective: We evaluated the current off-label JAKi treatment experience for JAK/STAT inborn errors of immunity (IEI) among European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID)/European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Inborn Errors Working Party (IEWP) centers.\r\n\r\nMethods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study on patients with a genetic disorder of hyperactive JAK/STAT signaling who received JAKi treatment for at least 3 months.\r\n\r\nResults: Sixty-nine patients (72% children) were evaluated (45 STAT1 gain of function [GOF], 21 STAT3-GOF, 1 STAT5B-GOF, 1 suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 [aka SOCS1] loss of function, 1 JAK1-GOF). Ruxolitinib was the predominantly prescribed JAKi (80%). Overall, treatment resulted in improvement (partial or complete remission) of clinical symptoms in 87% of STAT1-GOF and in 90% of STAT3-GOF patients. We documented highly heterogeneous dosing and monitoring regimens. The response rate and time to response varied across different diseases and manifestations. Adverse events including infection and weight gain were frequent (38% of patients) but were mild (grade I-II) and transient in most patients. At last follow-up, 52 (74%) of 69 patients were still receiving JAKi treatment, and 11 patients eventually underwent HSCT after receipt of previous JAKi bridging therapy, with 91% overall survival.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Our study suggests that JAKi may be highly effective to treat symptomatic JAK/STAT IEI patients. Prospective studies to define optimal JAKi dosing for the variable clinical presentations and age ranges should be pursued.",

It is both a teaching text for students and a resource for researchers and practitioners engaged in the design and scaling of technologies for low-resource communities. The scope is broad, ranging from the development of mobile applications for low-literacy users to hardware and software solutions for providing electricity and water in remote settings. It is also highly interdisciplinary, drawing on methods and theory from the social sciences as well as engineering and the natural sciences.\r\nThe opening section reviews the history of \u201ctechnology-for-development\u201d research, and presents a framework that formalizes this body of work and begins its transformation into an academic discipline. It identifies common challenges in development and explains the book\u2019s iterative approach of \u201cinnovation, implementation, evaluation, adaptation.\u201d Each of the next six thematic sections focuses on a different sector: energy and environment; market performance; education and labor; water, sanitation and health; digital governance; and connectivity. These thematic sections contain case studies from landmark research that directly integrates engineering innovation with technically rigorous methods from the social sciences. Each case study describes the design, evaluation, and/or scaling of a technology in the field and follows a single form, with common elements and discussion questions, to create continuity and pedagogical consistency. Together, they highlight successful solutions to development challenges, while also analyzing the rarely discussed failures. The book concludes by reiterating the core principles of development engineering illustrated in the case studies, highlighting common challenges that engineers and scientists will face in designing technology interventions that sustainably accelerate economic development.\r\nDevelopment Engineering provides, for the first time, a coherent intellectual framework for attacking the challenges of poverty and global climate change through the design of better technologies. It offers the rigorous discipline needed to channel the energy of a new generation of scientists and engineers toward advancing social justice and improved living conditions in low-resource communities around the world.",

On the patient\u2019s side, traditional masculinity ideologies (TMI) have been linked to differing symptom presentation in depression, reduced psychotherapy use, poorer therapy engagement and increased risk for psychotherapy dropout. However, the association between therapists\u2019 endorsement of TMI and their assessment of gender differences in the treatment of depressive disorders has never been investigated. \r\nMethods: A total of 438 therapists (psychological psychotherapists or psychiatrists) from Switzerland, Germany and Austria completed an online questionnaire about their endorsement of TMI and their perceived differences in psychotherapy success in female and male depression patients.\r\nResults: Most therapists indicated no difference in their perceived treatment success for depression therapy with men and women (n=283, 65%). However, the vast majority of the 155(35%) psychotherapists who reported a difference in treatment success disfavored men (n=118,27%) as compared to women (n=37, 8%). Psychotherapists who disfavored men also showed higher endorsement of TMI as compared to psychotherapists who reported no perceived gender-differences in psychotherapy success. \r\nConclusion: Our results suggest that there might be a group of psychotherapists (high in TMI)that perceive men with depression as harder to treat than female depression patients. Previous findings on therapist effects suggest that this bias could negatively influence psychotherapy outcomes in male patients. Clinicians should recognize that endorsing TMI may bias their perception of treatment success, potentially disadvantaging male depression patients.",

However, the role of conformity to TMI in relation to psychotherapy dropout is still unclear. \r\nAim: The present study aims to clarify the relationship between conformity to TMI and premature termination of psychotherapy (dropout) in men.\r\nMethod: Data was used from an anonymous online survey in German-speaking Europe. Participants with previous psychotherapy experience provided information on sociodemographics, mental health, TMI, and their past experiences with psychotherapy. Discontinuation of psychotherapy was assessed by self-report and further differentiated into discontinuation with or without consulting the therapist. Men with an unconsulted therapy ending were defined as psychotherapy dropouts. Conformity to TMI was assessed using the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory.\r\nResults: Of the 266 men (mean [SD] age, 46.1 [13.6]) with psychotherapy experience, 30.5% (n = 81) reported having discontinued psychotherapy at least once, whereas 17.7% (n = 47) of the total sample reported dropout. These 47 men showed significantly higher conformity to TMI than men who did not report past dropout. The sub-scales of self-reliance and playboy showed the strongest associations with psychotherapy dropout.\r\nConclusions: Dropout from psychotherapy was significantly associated with higher conformity to TMI. Therapists should consider, and where necessary, work to flexibly adapt to TMI which may influence how men engage in mental health care. Such an approach would likely improve men\u2019s ongoing engagement in psychotherapy, promoting opportunities to prevent avoidable psychotherapy dropout for men most at risk of deleterious mental health outcomes.",

We hypothesize that chronically elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone exposure during early life may promote TART development.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\nThis study aimed to examine the association between commencing adequate glucocorticoid treatment early after birth and TART development.\r\n\r\nDESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS\r\nThis retrospective multicenter (n = 22) open cohort study collected longitudinal clinical and biochemical data of the first 4 years of life using the I-CAH registry and included 188 male patients (median age 13 years; interquartile range: 10-17) with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 181) or 11-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 7).

Within adrenocortical carcinoma, a recently described subtype characterized by a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) has been associated with an especially poor prognosis. However, the drivers of CIMP remain unknown. Furthermore, the functional relation between CIMP and poor clinical outcomes of patients with adrenocortical carcinoma stays elusive.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nHere, we show that CIMP in adrenocortical carcinoma is linked to the increased expression of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3A driven by a gain of gene copy number and cell hyperproliferation. Importantly, we demonstrate that CIMP contributes to tumor aggressiveness by favoring tumor immune escape. This effect could be at least partially reversed by treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nIn sum, our findings suggest that co-treatment with demethylating agents might enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and could represent a novel therapeutic approach for patients with high CIMP adrenocortical carcinoma.",

We provide theory and evidence on the contribution of slave wealth to Britain\u2019s growth prior to 1835. We compare areas of Britain with high and low exposure to the colonial plantation economy, using granular data on wealth from compensation records. Before the major expansion of slave holding from the 1640s onwards, both types of area exhibited similar levels of economic activity. However, by the 1830s, slavery wealth is strongly correlated with economic development \u2013 slave-holding areas are less agricultural, closer to cotton mills, and have higher property wealth. We rationalize these findings using a dynamic spatial model, where slavery investment raises the return to capital accumulation, expanding production in capital-intensive sectors. To establish causality, we use arguably exogenous variation in slave mortality on the passage from Africa to the Indies, driven by weather shocks. We show that weather shocks influenced the continued involvement of ancestors in the slave trade; weather-induced slave mortality of slave-trading ancestors in each area is strongly predictive of slaveholding in 1833. Quantifying our model using the observed data, we find that Britain would have been substantially poorer and more agricultural in the absence of overseas slave wealth. Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that slavery wealth accelerated Britain\u2019s industrial revolution.",

Our experiment involves several rounds of real-effort production, in which we vary the degree to which individual income is redistributed at the end of each round according to either progressive or regressive redistributive policies.

While some studies quantify the biomechanical (kinetic) parameters of SMob, interpretation of findings is difficult due to poor reporting of methodological details. The aim of this study was to synthesise the literature describing force-time characteristics of manually applied SMob.\r\n\r\nMethods: This study is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement. Databases were searched from inception to October 2022: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, CINAHL, ICL, PEDro and Cochrane Library. Data were extracted and reported descriptively for the following domains: general study characteristics, number of and characteristics of individuals who delivered/received SMob, region treated, equipment used and force-time characteristics of SMob.\r\n\r\nResults: There were 7,607 records identified and of these, 36 (0.5%) were included in the analysis. SMob was delivered to the cervical spine in 13 (36.1%), the thoracic spine in 3 (8.3%) and the lumbopelvic spine in 18 (50.0%) studies. In 2 (5.6%) studies, spinal region was not specified. For SMob applied to all spinal regions, force-time characteristics were: peak force (0-128N); duration (10-120s); frequency (0.1-4.5Hz); and force amplitude (1-102N).\r\n\r\nConclusions: This study reports considerable variability of the force-time characteristics of SMob. In studies reporting force-time characteristics, SMob was most frequently delivered to the lumbar and cervical spine of humans and most commonly peak force was reported. Future studies should focus on the detailed reporting of force-time characteristics to facilitate the investigation of clinical dose-response effects.",

This phenomenon has led to a search for a common explanation. We instead develop a theory where increases in income inequality originating within a few occupations can \u201cspill over\u201d through consumption into others. We show theoretically that such spillovers occur when an occupation provides non-divisible services to consumers, with physicians our prime example. Examining local income inequality across U.S. regions, the data suggest that such spillovers exist for physicians, dentists, and real estate agents. Estimated spillovers for other occupations are consistent with the predictions of our theory.",

Given data limitations we employ a \u2018next best\u2019 approach to apply this framework and measure local government performance by combining a weighted \u2018quality of reporting\u2019 measure with selected available measures on political processes and internal operations, and policy implementation, so as to construct a composite index for local government performance (LGI). We also look at the relationship between our performance indices and other indices of local government performance in Ghana, as well as poverty headcounts. We find that, on average, urban districts perform better than their rural counterparts and also districts located in the southern half of Ghana perform better. Our constructed composite index is positively correlated with indices from Ghana\u2019s district league tables. It has a negative relationship with poverty headcount in districts, indicating that districts with lower poverty incidence are more effective and responsive to their citizens. The findings provide a snapshot of institutional performance across Ghana\u2019s districts, and offer a more comprehensive basis for considering variations in subnational institutional performance, including the effects of decentralisation than previous studies of Ghana \u2013 or indeed African countries more broadly.",

Therefore, also the biological reference value (BAR) has to be re-evaluated. To this end, the existing literature was updated and taken into account. Four published studies showed that the excretion of TdAA in humans occupationally exposed to vinyl chloride and non-exposed persons largely overlaps, especially in the exposure range < 5 ml/m3. This may lead to a situation where unexposed persons may falsely be considered exposed to vinyl chloride as well as \u2013 on the other hand \u2013 real exposures may not be identified. Nevertheless, in order to keep an instrument for the assessment of higher exposures, notably after accidents or leakages, the Commission decided to confirm the existing BAR of 1.5 mg TdAA/l urine, however with the additional remark \u201cThis BAR is not suitable for the assessment of vinyl chloride exposures < 5 ml/m3\u201d. Owing to the different excretion characteristics after hig vs. low vinyl chloride exposures, it is further recommended to obtain two separate urinesamples after 12\u201318 and 48 hours, respectively, after an accidental exposure.",

How to improve treatment responses in these tumors is still a challenge. Using an integrated screening approach to identify cancer-specific vulnerabilities, we identified complement receptor C5aR1 as a druggable target, which when inhibited improved radiotherapy, even in tumors displaying immunosuppressive features and poor CD8+ T cell infiltration. While C5aR1 is well-known for its role in the immune compartment, we found that C5aR1 is also robustly expressed on malignant epithelial cells, highlighting potential tumor cell-specific functions. C5aR1 targeting resulted in increased NF-\u03baB-dependent apoptosis specifically in tumors and not normal tissues, indicating that, in malignant cells, C5aR1 primarily regulated cell fate. Collectively, these data revealed that increased complement gene expression is part of the stress response mounted by irradiated tumors and that targeting C5aR1 could improve radiotherapy, even in tumors displaying immunosuppressive features.",

        "document": "Title: Neural correlates of visual and audiovisual language processing in children with poor versus typical reading skills\nAbstract: Written language has become indispensable for communication in our society. Reading difficulties therefore pose a severe obstacle to the active involvement as a citizen. Consequently, developmental dyslexia (DYS) can lead to poor educational outcomes, diminished future professional opportunities, and compromised mental health. Although a diverse set of models for the etiology and underlying (neural) deficits of DYS have been put forward and multiple neural processes may in fact be affected by DYS, automatic visual word recognition and audiovisual (AV) integration are two skills that are thought to be foundational for reading and are often proposed to be altered in DYS. However, few studies have investigated the temporal profile and level of automatic visual processing of orthography in the brain across a range of reading proficiencies in children. Furthermore, it remains understudied how children with varying reading abilities use prior auditory cues to help them process visual information. Hence, in this dissertation project, we investigated the influence of reading skills on automatic visual processing and audiovisual integration in beginning readers in two EEG studies.  \r\nPrevious studies have suggested that visual neural print sensitivity follows an extended development in children and is reduced in children with reading impairments. In our first study, we investigated whether and to what degree beginning readers demonstrate print sensitivity and familiarity and whether there are differences in neural processing between children with typical (TR) and poor reading skills (PR). We recorded brain responses to a rapid sequence of visual stimuli where most stimuli belonged to the same category (base) and a stimulus of a deviating category (oddball) was shown less frequently. A differential brain response to the infrequent deviant stimulus signifies automatic detection of the visual change and differentiation between the oddball and the base. To test the level of sensitivity to print, we contrasted false font (FF) and consonant string (CS) oddballs against word (W) bases. Specifically, FF in W assessed coarse print sensitivity, while CS in W evaluated fine print sensitivity. Additionally, to determine the automatic familiarity with orthographic regularity, we compared W, pseudoword (PW), and CS oddballs inserted into an FF sequence. Our findings indicated the presence of coarse but not fine print sensitivity responses in both reading groups. For orthographic regularity, we found a stepwise difference in activation to the conditions, with stronger activations to oddballs containing more familiar/regular letter combinations (W) than those with less regular letter combinations (CS). This effect was more pronounced and exhibited greater left-lateralization in TR than PR. In contrast, PR displayed a similar activation pattern in the right hemisphere. These results align with prior research, suggesting that although both PR and TR exhibit early coarse sensitivity to print, sublexical processing is emerging in TR but altered in PR. \r\nIn the second study, we were interested in the influence of reading skills on AV integration depending on orthography (W versus Obj) and lexicality (W versus PW). As a measure of AV integration, we compared electrophysiological responses to incongruent and congruent AV stimulus pairs. Behavioral findings indicated greater difficulties in perceiving or resolving AV conflicts in children with poorer reading skills specifically for orthographic conditions. Moreover, on a neural level, we observed faster integration of non-orthographic than orthographic AV pairs on all reading levels, but more pronounced orthographic integration processing for children with higher reading skills. These results suggest a domain-specific alteration in the visual matching of orthographic conditions with an auditory prime in children with poorer reading abilities. \r\nIn this work, we gained new and more resolved knowledge about the level of automatic visual print and familiarity processing and AV integration in Swiss-German 2nd-3rd grade children with different reading abilities. Our results support and expand upon the idea that children with typical reading abilities undergo extended developmental refinement in neural orthographic processing and AV congruency priming. Conversely, children with reading impairments experience delayed or altered development in print-related behavioral and neural processes. These findings contribute to our understanding of the processes underlying reading and deficits thereof in children with DYS. Several possible approaches to refine future studies are discussed, including adopting a longitudinal design, systematically comparing various experimental parameters, accounting for individual variability or subgroup differences, and implementing innovative analysis methods. Lastly, we emphasize the need to effectively communicate and translate research findings",

A better understanding of the cellular heterogeneity and interplay of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor microenvironment will support the development of personalized therapies. We report a spatially resolved single-cell imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analysis of CAFs in a non-small cell lung cancer cohort of 1,070 patients. We identify four prognostic patient groups based on 11 CAF phenotypes with distinct spatial distributions and show that CAFs are independent prognostic factors for patient survival. The presence of tumor-like CAFs is strongly correlated with poor prognosis. In contrast, inflammatory CAFs and interferon-response CAFs are associated with inflamed tumor microenvironments and higher patient survival. High density of matrix CAFs is correlated with low immune infiltration and is negatively correlated with patient survival. In summary, our data identify phenotypic and spatial features of CAFs that are associated with patient outcome in NSCLC.",

Using a fast periodic visual oddball stimulation (FPVS) design during electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the level of sensitivity and familiarity to word form processing in ninety-two children in 2nd and 3rd grade with varying reading skills (n\u00a0=\u00a035 for PR, n\u00a0=\u00a040 for typical reading skills; TR). To test children's level of \"sensitivity\", false font (FF) and consonant string (CS) oddballs were embedded in base presentations of word (W) stimuli. \"Familiarity\" was examined by presenting letter string oddballs with increasing familiarity (CS, pseudoword - PW, W) in FF base stimuli. Overall, our results revealed stronger left-hemispheric coarse sensitivity effects (\"FF in W\"\u00a0>\u00a0\"CS in W\") in TR than in PR in both topographic and oddball frequency analyses. Further, children distinguished between orthographically legal and illegal (\"W/PW in FF\"\u00a0>\u00a0\"CS in FF\") but not yet between lexical and non-lexical (\"W in FF\" vs \"PW in FF\") word forms. Although both TR and PR exhibit visual sensitivity and can distinguish between orthographically legal and illegal letter strings, they still struggle with nuanced lexical distinctions. Moreover, the strength of sensitivity is linked to reading proficiency. Our work adds to established knowledge in the field to characterize the relationship between print tuning and reading skills and suggests differences in the developmental progress to automatically process word forms.",

The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with or without isolated or combined MR and TR across the entire HF spectrum.\r\n\r\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe ESC-HFA EORP HF Long-Term Registry is a prospective, multicentre, observational study including patients with HF and 1-year follow-up data. Outpatients without aortic valve disease were included and stratified according to isolated or combined moderate/severe MR and TR. Among 11\u2009298 patients, 7541 (67%) had no MR/TR, 1931 (17%) isolated MR, 616 (5.5%) isolated TR and 1210 (11%) combined MR/TR. Baseline characteristics were differently distributed across MR/TR categories. Compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction, HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction was associated with a lower risk of isolated MR (odds ratio [OR] 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.80), and distinctly lower risk of combined MR/TR (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.41-0.62). HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) was associated with a distinctly lower risk of isolated MR (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.36-0.49), and combined MR/TR (OR 0.59; 95% 0.50-0.70), but a distinctly increased risk of isolated TR (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.61-2.33). All-cause death, cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization and combined outcomes occurred more frequently in combined MR/TR, isolated TR and isolated MR versus no MR/TR. The highest incident rates were observed in isolated TR and combined MR/TR.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn a large cohort of outpatients with HF, prevalence of isolated and combined MR and TR was relatively high.

Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significantly poorer survival rate in subjects with higher SUA (> 5.6 mg/dl in men and 5.1 mg/dl in women) and LVH (log-rank chi-square 298.105; P<0.0001). At multivariate Cox regression analysis in women LVH alone and the combination of higher SUA and LVH but not hyperuricemia alone, were associated with a higher risk of CV death, while in men hyperuricemia without LVH, LVH without hyperuricemia and their combination were all associated with a higher incidence of CV death.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nOur findings demonstrate that SUA is independently associated with LVMI and suggest that the combination of hyperuricemia with LVH is an independent and powerful predictor for CV death both in men and women.",

        "document": "Title: Happy Hour: The association between trait hedonic capacity and motivation to drink alcohol\nAbstract: The (over)consumption of alcohol and other addictive substances is often conceptualized as a problem of low self-control (i.e., people\u2019s inability to inhibit unwanted impulses). According to that view, people drink because they cannot resist. In the present studies, we approached this from a different perspective and tested whether alcohol consumption might also be a problem of low hedonic capacity (i.e., people\u2019s inability to experience pleasure and relaxation, often due to intrusive thoughts). According to that view, people drink because it helps them enjoy or cope with negative thoughts or emotions. In two studies among individuals at low risk of harmful alcohol use (e.g., AUDIT < 7) we consistently found that trait hedonic capacity was unrelated to alcohol consumption but negatively related to coping motivation (drinking alcohol to cope with negative thoughts and feelings; Study 1: N = 348; Study 2: N = 302, preregistered). Exploratory analyses in study 2 (conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic) also showed that people with low, but not high, trait hedonic capacity drank more alcohol in response to stress. Our findings are in line with the notion that people\u2019s drinking motivation and behavior might not only be a problem of poor self-control but also of low trait hedonic capacity. They align with a new direction in addiction prevention and treatment research, which explores ways to help people to seek out and savor hedonic experiences from non-drug related reinforcers (e.g., engaging in leisure activities).",

The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with poor functional outcomes by assessing multiple dimensions of digestive performance and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Patients with cancer-free survival after Ivor Lewis esophagectomy were included. Four functional syndromes (dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), delayed gastric conduit emptying (DGCE), and dumping syndrome (DS)) and HRQL were assessed using specifically designed questionnaires. Patient outcomes were compared with healthy controls. Independent factors associated with poor digestive performance were identified through multivariable analysis. Sixty-five postoperative patients and 50 healthy volunteers participated in this study. Compared with controls, patients had worse outcomes for dysphagia, GERD, DS, and HRQL, but not for DGCE. A multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation of reduced digestive performance with ASA score, squamous cell carcinoma, open or hybrid surgical approach, and (neo)adjuvant therapy. In contrast, no individual patient factor was found to be associated with dumping syndrome. Digestive function and HRQL are substantially impaired after Ivor Lewis esophagectomy for cancer. Comorbid patients undergoing multimodal treatment and open access surgery for squamous cell carcinoma have the highest risk of poor functional outcome.",

Therefore, identification of at-risk patients is relevant for preventive interventions. \r\nClinical Question: What variables influence weight and fat gain in patients in the first year after kidney transplantation? Literature Search Prospective and retrospective cohort studies published in or after 2001 naming fat and/or overall weight gain during the first year after kidney transplantation as outcome variable(s) were systematically searched in Medline/Pubmed in November 2018 and March 2022. \r\nClinical Appraisal: We identified 16 studies examining a wide variety of potential factors influencing weight and fat gain over the first posttransplant years. These included genetic, socio-demographic, behavioral, biomedical, psychological and environmental factors. For a number of variables, study results were contradictory: some studies indicated preventive impacts on weight or fat gain; others concluded that the same factors increased it. Cases were discussed with 2 clinical experts. We eventually agreed on 13 potentially relevant risk factors for post-transplant weight/fat gain: age, gender, genes, income, ethnicity, education, eating habits, physical activity, smoking cessation, baseline BMI, baseline fat, depression and perceived overall wellbeing. Integration into Practice Before integration into clinical practice, a critical evaluation of all potential risk factors' suitability for assessment will be necessary. In addition to feasibility, operational definitions and measurement methods must also be considered. \r\nEvaluation: To reduce the list of risk factors to the most relevant, a first testing within a prospectively collected data set is planned.",

However, factors associated with disease flares remain unknown. This study aimed to identify factors associated with breakthrough infection (BIs) and disease flares in patients with RA following COVID-19. We analysed data from RA patients who participated in the COVID-19 vaccination in autoimmune diseases (COVAD) study. Demographic data, patient-reported outcomes, comorbidities, pharmacologic treatment and details regarding disease flares were extracted from the COVAD database. Factors associated with disease flare-ups were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The analysis comprised 1928 patients with RA who participated in the COVAD study. Younger age, Caucasian ethnicity, comorbidities with obstructive chronic pulmonary disease and asthma were associated with COVID-19 breakthrough infection. Moreover, younger age (odds ratio (OR): 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, p\u2009<\u20090.001), ethnicity other than Asian, past history of tuberculosis (OR: 3.80, 95% CI 1.12-12.94, p\u2009=\u20090.033), treatment with methotrexate (OR: 2.55, 95% CI: 1.56-4.17, p\u2009<\u20090.001), poor global physical health (OR: 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.15, p\u2009=\u20090.044) and mental health (OR: 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.95, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were independent factors associated disease flares in patients with RA. Our study highlights the impact of socio-demographic factors, clinical characteristics and mental health on disease flares in patients with RA. These insights may help determine relevant strategies to proactively manage RA patients at risk of flares.",

        "document": "Title: The Psychoneuroimmunological Model of Moral Distress and Health in Healthcare Workers: Toward Individual and System-Level Solutions\nAbstract: Healthcare is presently experiencing a global workforce crisis, marked by the inability of hospitals to retain qualified healthcare workers. Indeed, poor working conditions and staff shortages have contributed to structural collapse and placed a heavy toll on healthcare workers' (HCWs) well-being, with many suffering from stress, exhaustion, demoralization, and burnout. An additional factor driving qualified HCWs away is the repeated experience of moral distress, or the inability to act according to internally held moral values and perceived ethical obligations due to internal and external constraints. Despite general awareness of this crisis, we currently lack an organized understanding of how stress leads to poor health, wellbeing, and performance in healthcare workers. To address this critical issue, we first review the literature on moral distress, stress, and health in HCWs. Second, we summarize the biobehavioral pathways linking occupational and interpersonal stressors to health in this population, focusing on neuroendocrine, immune, genetic, and epigenetic processes. Third, we propose a novel Psychoneuroimmunological Model of Moral Distress and Health in HCWs based on this literature. Finally, we discuss evidence-based individual- and system-level interventions for preventing stress and promoting resilience at work. Throughout this review, we underscore that stress levels in HCWs are a major public health concern, and that a combination of system-level and individual-level interventions are necessary to address preventable health care harm and foster resilience in this population, including new health policies, mental health initiatives, and additional translational research.",

The aim was to quantify effects of light obstruction in a kidney calyx model.\r\nMETHODS: We evaluated a series of contemporary flexible ureteroscopes including the Storz Flex-Xc and Flex-X2s, Olympus V3 and P7, Pusen 7.5F and 9.2F, as well as OTU Wiscope using an enclosed 3D-printed pink in vitro kidney calyx model submerged in saline, where the field of light was intentionally partially obstructed alternatively at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock. A color spectrometer was used for illuminance measurements at a 45\u00b0 opening position in the background of the model.\r\nRESULTS: Overall and mean background illuminance for each obstructive situation were significantly different between scopes for both 50% and 100% brightness settings (ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.001). At 50% brightness setting, almost all scopes had their highest and lowest background illuminance with the 6 o'clock and 3 o'clock obstructive situation, respectively. At 100% brightness setting, these became 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock obstructive situations. Considering each obstructive situation individually, the Flex-Xc was consistently the scope with highest background illuminance and the Pusen 7.5F the lowest. Background illuminance for each obstructive situation varied significantly for each scope individually, with the greatest range of variability for Pusen 7.5F and V3.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Illuminance performance of ureteroscopes within an obstructed calyx model differ significantly for various obstructive situations. Urologists should be aware of this to help guide their choice of ureteroscope.",

For the case of critical coupling, we show that the Hausdorff measure of the spectrum may vanish (for appropriately chosen frequencies) whenever the gauge function tends to zero faster than logarithmically. For arbitrary coupling, we show that modulus of continuity of the integrated density of states can be arbitrary close to logarithmic; we also prove a similar result for the Lyapunov exponent as a function of the spectral parameter. Finally, we show that (for any coupling) there exist frequencies for which the spectrum is not homogeneous in the sense of Carleson, and, moreover, fails the Parreau\u2013Widom condition. The frequencies for which these properties hold are explicitly described in terms of the growth of the denominators of the convergents.",

Given the wide range of diseases that these species might have, ensuring that the animals\u2019 health status is appropriate can be complex and challenging. The Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations has previously published recommendations for the health monitoring of experimental colonies of pigs (1998) and, respectively, calves, sheep and goats (2000). Unfortunately, the uptake of those recommendations was poor and insufficiently reported in scientific publications. These new recommendations for best practice focus on the main species of ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats) and pigs. They provide general and specific information helpful for designing a health management programme for the suppliers and for the user establishments, as well as guidance on animal procurement. Critical thinking based on the fields of use of the animals is promoted, aiming to help in taking informed decisions rather than establishing an exhaustive exclusion list for pathogens. Implementing the best health and welfare management practices should be done under the guidance of a competent attending veterinarian, with expertise and sufficient authority to take the appropriate action, doubled by excellent communication skills. It is strongly recommended that the user establishment\u2019s veterinarian works in close collaboration with the supplier\u2019s veterinarian.\r\n//\r\nDie meisten Wiederk\u00e4uer und Schweine, die zu wissenschaftlichen und Ausbildungszwecken dienen, werden nicht eigens daf\u00fcr, sondern in einem landwirtschaftlichen Umfeld gez\u00fcchtet.

However, it remains unclear whether oEVs contribute to the recognition of the presence of embryos and their quality in the oviduct. Hence, we examined whether the molecular cargo of oEVs secreted by bovine oviduct epithelial cells (BOEC) differs depending on the presence of good (\u2265\u20098 cells, G) or poor (<\u20098 cells, P) quality embryos. In addition, differences in RNA profiles between G and P embryos were analyzed in attempt to distinguish oEVs and embryonic EVs cargos.\r\nMETHODS: For this purpose, primary BOEC were co-cultured with in vitro produced embryos (IVP) 53\u00a0h post fertilization as follows: BOEC with G embryos (BGE); BOEC with P embryos (BPE); G embryos alone (GE); P embryos alone (PE); BOEC alone (B) and medium control (M). After 24\u00a0h of co-culture, conditioned media were collected from all groups and EVs were isolated and characterized. MicroRNA profiling of EVs and embryos was performed by small RNA-sequencing.\r\nRESULTS: In EVs, 84 miRNAs were identified, with 8 differentially abundant (DA) miRNAs for BGE vs. B and 4 for BPE vs. B (P-value\u2009<\u20090.01). In embryos, 187 miRNAs were identified, with 12 DA miRNAs for BGE vs. BPE, 3 for G vs. P, 8 for BGE vs. GE, and 11 for BPE vs. PE (P-value\u2009<\u20090.01).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that oEVs are involved in the oviductal-embryo recognition and pointed to specific miRNAs with signaling and supporting roles during early embryo development.",

Survival varies considerably by grade, histology, biomarkers, and genetic alterations such as IDH mutations and MGMT promoter methylation, and treatment, but is poor for some grades and histologies, with many patients with glioblastoma surviving less than a year from diagnosis. The present review provides an introduction to glioma, including its classification, epidemiology, economic and humanistic burden, as well as treatment options. Another focus is on treatment recommendations for IDH-mutant astrocytoma, IDH-mutant oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma, which were synthesized from recent guidelines. While recommendations are nuanced and reflect the complexity of the disease, maximum safe resection is typically the first step in treatment, followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy using temozolomide or procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine. Immunotherapies and targeted therapies currently have only a limited role due to disappointing clinical trial results, including in recurrent glioblastoma, for which the nitrosourea lomustine remains the de facto standard of care. The lack of treatment options is compounded by frequently suboptimal clinical practice, in which patients do not receive adequate therapy after resection, including delayed, shortened, or discontinued radiotherapy and chemotherapy courses due to treatment side effects. These unmet needs will require significant efforts to address, including a continued search for novel treatment options, increased awareness of clinical guidelines, improved toxicity management for chemotherapy, and the generation of additional and more robust clinical and health economic evidence.",

Based on microscopic appearance and molecular characteristics, they are classified according to the WHO classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumours and graded into CNS WHO grades 1-4 from a low to high grade of malignancy. Diffusely infiltrating gliomas in adults comprise three tumour types with distinct natural course of disease, response to treatment and outcome: isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas with the best prognosis; IDH-mutant astrocytomas with intermediate outcome; and IDH-wild-type glioblastomas with poor prognosis. Pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common glioma in children and is characterized by circumscribed growth, frequent BRAF alterations and favourable prognosis. Diffuse gliomas in children are divided into clinically indolent low-grade tumours and high-grade tumours with aggressive behaviour, with histone 3 K27-altered diffuse midline glioma being the leading cause of glioma-related death in children. Ependymal tumours are subdivided into biologically and prognostically distinct types on the basis of histology, molecular biomarkers and location. Although surgery, radiotherapy and alkylating agent chemotherapy are the mainstay of glioma treatment, individually tailored strategies based on tumour-intrinsic dominant signalling pathways have improved outcome in subsets of patients.",

Despite previous studies, it is still unclear how survivors perceive their quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to evaluate self-perceived QoL in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who present with poor clinical condition, as defined by World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grades 4 to 5, compared with those who present in more favorable clinical condition (WFNS 1-3).\r\n          \r\nMETHODS:\r\n            Between 2011 and 2021, 1160 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were admitted to the Amsterdam UMC. Among the 845 patients who survived, 537 participated in the QoL questionnaires. Patient characteristics, complications, EQ-5D questionnaires, modified Rankin Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables or the Pearson \u03c7$^{2}$ test for categorical variables.\r\n          \r\nRESULTS:\r\n            Of the 537 responders, 452 (84%) presented with low grade (WFNS 1-3) and 85 (16%) presented with high grade (WFNS 4-5). The high-grade group reported a self-perceived QoL score of 70 (of 100), while the low-grade group reported a score of 75 (P = .12). The mean EQ-5D index value was 0.74 for the high-grade group and 0.81 for the low-grade group (P < .01). In the high-grade group, 61 patients (72%) had a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-3) compared with 419 (94%) in the low-grade group (P < .001).\r\n          \r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n            High-grade WFNS patients rated their QoL as satisfactory, with only a marginal 5-point difference on a 100-point scale compared with low-grade WFNS patients. In addition, almost three-quarters of high-grade WFNS survivors achieved a favorable outcome. Given that a subset of patients, despite presenting with a poor clinical condition, still achieve a favorable outcome, these findings reinforce our perspective advocating for early and comprehensive treatment.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing PCD-CT including a coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and a late enhancement (LE) scan and having a blood hematocrit were retrospectively included. In the first 75 patients (derivation cohort), CCTA and LE scans were reconstructed as VNI at 60, 70, and 80\u2009keV and as VNC with quantum iterative reconstruction (QIR) strengths 2, 3, and 4. Blood pool attenuation (BP$_{mean}$) was correlated to blood hematocrit. In the next 50 patients (validation cohort), synthetic hematocrit was calculated using BP$_{mean}$. Myocardial ECV was computed using the synthetic hematocrit and compared with the ECV using the blood hematocrit as a reference. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort (49 men, mean age 79\u2009\u00b1\u20098 years), a correlation between BP$_{mean}$ and blood hematocrit ranged from poor for VNI of CCTA at 80\u2009keV, QIR2 (R$^{2}$\u2009=\u20090.12) to moderate for VNI of LE at 60\u2009keV, QIR4; 70\u2009keV, QIR3 and 4; and VNC of LE, QIR3 and 4 (all, R$^{2}$\u2009=\u20090.58). In the validation cohort (29 men, age 75\u2009\u00b1\u200914 years), synthetic hematocrit was calculated from VNC of the LE scan, QIR3. Median ECV was 26.9% (interquartile range (IQR), 25.5%, 28.8%) using the blood hematocrit and 26.8% (IQR, 25.4%, 29.7%) using synthetic hematocrit (VNC, QIR3; mean difference, -0.2%; limits of agreement, -2.4%, 2.0%; p\u2009=\u20090.33). CONCLUSION: Synthetic hematocrit calculated from VNC images enables an accurate computation of myocardial ECV with PCD-CT. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Virtual non-contrast images from cardiac late enhancement scans with photon-counting detector CT allow the calculation of a synthetic hematocrit, which enables accurate computation of myocardial extracellular volume. KEY POINTS: - Blood hematocrit is mandatory for conventional myocardial extracellular volume computation. - Synthetic hematocrit can be calculated from virtual non-iodine and non-contrast photon-counting detector CT images. - Synthetic hematocrit from virtual non-contrast images enables computation of the myocardial extracellular volume.",

We aimed to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis by opportunistic CT in patients who underwent lung cancer screening (LCS) using non-contrast CT in the Northeastern United States. Demographics including race and ethnicity were retrieved. We assessed trabecular bone and body composition using a fully-automated artificial intelligence algorithm. ROIs were placed at T12 vertebral body for attenuation measurements in Hounsfield Units (HU). Two validated thresholds were used to diagnose osteoporosis: high-sensitivity threshold (115-165 HU) and high specificity threshold (<115 HU). We performed descriptive statistics and ANOVA to compare differences across sex, race, ethnicity, and income class according to neighborhoods' mean household incomes. Forward stepwise regression modeling was used to determine body composition predictors of trabecular attenuation. We included 3708 patients (mean age 64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0years, 54\u00a0% males) who underwent LCS, had available demographic information and an evaluable CT for trabecular attenuation analysis. Using the high sensitivity threshold, osteoporosis was more prevalent in females (74\u00a0% vs. 65\u00a0% in males, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and Whites (72\u00a0% vs 49\u00a0% non-Whites, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). However, osteoporosis was present across all races (38\u00a0% Black, 55\u00a0% Asian, 56\u00a0% Hispanic) and affected all income classes (69\u00a0%, 69\u00a0%, and 91\u00a0% in low, medium, and high-income class, respectively). High visceral/subcutaneous fat-ratio, aortic calcification, and hepatic steatosis were associated with low trabecular attenuation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), whereas muscle mass was positively associated with trabecular attenuation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In conclusion, osteoporosis is prevalent across all races, income classes and both sexes in patients undergoing LCS. Opportunistic CT using a fully-automated algorithm and uniform imaging protocol is able to detect osteoporosis and body composition without additional testing or radiation. Early identification of patients traditionally thought to be at low risk for bone loss will allow for initiating appropriate treatment to prevent future fragility fractures.",

In this follow-up analysis of real-world data, we aimed to investigate the clinical management and outcomes of advanced melanoma patients in a tertiary referral center in Switzerland approximately a decade after the introduction of ICIs and BRAF/MEKi into clinical use. Moreover, we aimed to compare the results with seminal phase 3 trials and to identify areas of high unmet clinical need. Methods: This single-center retrospective cohort study analyzed the melanoma registry of the University Hospital Zurich, a tertiary cancer center in Switzerland, and included patients treated in the resectable/adjuvant (n = 331) or unresectable/metastatic setting (n = 375). Results: In the resectable setting, adjuvant anti-PD1 or BRAF/MEKi showed a 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of 53% and 67.6%, respectively, and the overall median RFS was 50 months. Patients with lymph node plus in-transit metastases or with distant metastases prior to commencing adjuvant treatment had a significantly reduced overall survival (OS). In 10.9% of patients, the treatment was stopped due to toxicity, which did not affect RFS/OS, unless the duration of the treatment was <3 months. Following a relapse of the disease during the first adjuvant treatment, the median progression-free survival (PFS2) was only 6.6 months; outcomes were particularly poor for relapses that were unresectable (median PFS2 3.9 months) or occurred within the first 2 months (median PFS2 2.7 months). A second adjuvant treatment for patients with resectable relapses still showed efficacy (median RFS2 43.7 months). Elevated LDH levels in patients with an unresectable relapse was correlated with a strong reduction in OS2 (HR 9.84, p = 0.018). In the unresectable setting, first-line anti-PD1, anti-CTLA4/PD1 combination, or BRAF/MEKi showed a 5-year OS of 46.5%, 52.4%, and 49.2%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, elevated LDH levels or the presence of brain metastases substantially shortened OS (HR > 1.78, p < 0.035). There was a non-significant trend for the improved survival of patients treated with anti-CTLA4/PD1 compared to anti-PD1 (HR 0.64, p = 0.15). After a progression on first-line therapy, the median OS2 was reduced to below two years. Elevated LDH (HR 4.65, p < 0.001) levels and widespread disease with at least three metastatic sites, particularly bone metastases (HR 2.62, p = 0.026), affected OS2. Conclusion: Our study offers real-world insights into the clinical management, treatment patterns, and outcomes of advanced melanoma patients in both the adjuvant and unresectable setting. Early relapses in patients undergoing adjuvant treatment pose a particular challenge but these patients are generally excluded from first-line trials. The approved first-line metastatic treatments are highly effective in the real-world setting with 5-year OS rates around 50%. However, outcomes remain poor for patients with brain metastases or who fail first-line treatment.",

There are differences between the publications in terms of salience, tone and there is a wide range of causes and solutions attributed to inequality with no consensus emerging. The coverage is framed mainly by state sources, and there is very little discussion of the finance sector and corporations as causes and solutions to tackle inequality. There are some positive trends emerging, as sustainable finance, climate change and gender equality are highlighted alongside some alternative solutions, indicating a move away from historical trends in news coverage that demonize poverty and focus simply on the individual.",

Prior research indicates that decreased HRV, marked by reduced autonomic balance, is related to poorer cognitive performance. While the population with congenital heart disease (CHD) show changes in HRV linked with the heart defect, the association between HRV and cognitive functions in CHD remains unexplored.\r\nMETHODS: 46 adolescents with CHD who went through infant open-heart surgery and 64 healthy controls (50.9% males, 12.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 years) underwent neurodevelopmental testing and photoplethysmograph acquisition. Group differences and associations with cognitive functions were analysed with linear regression. P values were FDR-corrected.\r\nRESULTS: Adolescents with CHD showed lower HRV (quantified by high-frequency power) compared to controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Lower HRV was correlated with worse executive function (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.24, p\u2009=\u20090.044) and lower IQ (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.26, p\u2009=\u20090.010) in the whole sample and with lower IQ (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.35, p\u2009=\u20090.014) in the CHD group. These associations were robust to confounders, including age, sex, and socioeconomic status.\r\nCONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate an association between HRV and cognitive functions in adolescents with complex CHD. Early detection of alterations in HRV/autonomic regulation may help to identify children with CHD at risk for cognitive impairments.\r\nIMPACT: Adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD) showed lower heart rate variability (HRV), indicating an imbalanced autonomic nervous system. Lower HRV was associated with lower IQ and executive function (EF) in the whole sample. The association between HRV and IQ was significantly stronger in CHD than in healthy controls. This study provides the first evidence of a link between altered HRV and cognitive impairments in the CHD population. Neurodevelopmental impairments seen in adolescents with CHD could be linked to their altered cardiac autonomic nervous activity, marked by low HRV.",

The high morbidity, mortality, and societal cost associated with paediatric sepsis render it a global health priority, as summarised in Paper 1 of this Series. Sepsis is characterised by a dysregulated host response to infection that manifests as organ failure, and children are uniquely susceptible to sepsis, as discussed in Paper 2. The focus of this third Series paper is quality improvement in paediatric sepsis. The 2017 WHO resolution on sepsis outlined key aims to reduce the burden of sepsis. As of 2024, only a small number of countries have implemented systematic, paediatric-focused quality improvement programmes to raise sepsis awareness, enhance recognition of sepsis, promote timely treatment, and provide long-term support for paediatric sepsis survivors. We examine programme successes and systematic barriers to quality improvement targeting paediatric sepsis. We highlight the need for programme design to consider the entire patient journey, starting with prevention, caregiver awareness, recognition at home, education of the health-care workforce, development of health-care systems, and establishment of long-term family and survivor support extending beyond the intensive care unit. Building on lessons learnt from existing quality improvement programmes, we outline implementation strategies and measures to enable benchmarking. Ultimately, quality improvement on a global scale can only be accelerated through a global learning platform focusing on paediatric sepsis.",

        "document": "Title: The burden and contemporary epidemiology of sepsis in children\nAbstract: Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Half of the 50 million people affected by sepsis globally every year are neonates and children younger than 19 years. This burden on the paediatric population translates into a disproportionate impact on global child health in terms of years of life lost, morbidity, and lost opportunities for children to reach their developmental potential. This Series on paediatric sepsis presents the current state of diagnosis and treatment of sepsis in children, and maps the challenges in alleviating the burden on children, their families, and society. Drawing on diverse experience and multidisciplinary expertise, we offer a roadmap to improving outcomes for children with sepsis. This first paper of the Series is a narrative review of the burden of paediatric sepsis from low-income to high-income settings. Advances towards improved operationalisation of paediatric sepsis across all age groups have facilitated more standardised assessment of the Global Burden of Disease estimates of the impact of sepsis on child health, and these estimates are expected to gain further precision with the roll out of the new Phoenix criteria for sepsis. Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality, with immense direct and indirect societal costs. Although substantial regional differences persist in relation to incidence, microbiological epidemiology, and outcomes, these cannot be explained by differences in income level alone. Recent insights into post-discharge sequelae after paediatric sepsis, ranging from late mortality and persistent neurodevelopmental impairment to reduced health-related quality of life, show how common post-sepsis syndrome is in children. Targeting sepsis as a key contributor to poor health outcomes in children is therefore an essential component of efforts to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.",

This trade\u2010off, brain sparing, has not been studied in the context of maternal infection. We investigated cases of maternal syphilis in the early 20th century and influenza during the 1918\u20131920 pandemic, in the Swiss city of Lausanne, a relatively high\u2010income setting. We tested the brain sparing hypothesis, that head circumference is protected at the expense of birth weight.\r\nMethods: A total of 8530 individual birth records from 1911 to 1922 from the University Maternity Hospital of Lausanne were used. We fitted generalized linear and additive linear models to explain how neonatal size varies under disease exposure.\r\nResults: Influenza reduced head circumference and birth weight among livebirths similarly, by \u22120.11 and \u22120.14 standard deviation (SD) units respectively. Conversely, for syphilis\u2010exposed infants, head circumference was affected more than birth weight (\u22120.61 SD vs. \u22120.46 SD). Stillborn infants exposed to syphilis experienced a much greater reduction in head circumference (\u22121.92 SD) than liveborn infants. After adjustment for gestational age, these findings persisted in the case of influenza, but the effects of syphilis were reduced. Furthermore, half of syphilis\u2010exposed infants were born before term, suggesting that lower infant size was partly mediated by shorter gestation. Nevertheless, head circumference among stillbirths exposed to syphilis was still substantially reduced, even after adjustment for gestational age (\u22121.26 SD).\r\nConclusion: Our findings do not support the brain sparing hypothesis. Moreover, the substantial reduction in head circumference among syphilis\u2010exposed fetuses might help explain why a quarter of them were stillborn.",

This study examined whether sociodemographic variations in the immune and inflammatory molecular underpinnings of chronic disease might emerge decades earlier in young adulthood. Using data from 1,069 young adults from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)\u2014the largest nationally representative and ethnically diverse sample with peripheral blood transcriptome profiles\u2014we analyzed variation in the expression of genes involved in inflammation and type I interferon (IFN) response as a function of individual demographic factors, sociodemographic conditions, and biobehavioral factors (smoking, drinking, and body mass index). Differential gene expression was most pronounced by sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI), but transcriptome correlates were identified for every demographic dimension analyzed. Inflammation-related gene expression showed the most pronounced variation as a function of biobehavioral factors (BMI and smoking) whereas type I IFN-related transcripts varied most strongly as a function of individual demographic characteristics (sex and race/ethnicity). Bioinformatic analyses of transcription factor and immune-cell activation based on transcriptome-wide empirical differences identified additional effects of family poverty and geographic region. These results identify pervasive sociodemographic differences in immune-cell gene regulation that emerge by young adulthood and may help explain social disparities in the development of chronic illness and premature mortality at older ages.",

        "document": "Title: Why Precarious Work Is Bad for Health: Social Marginality as Key Mechanisms in a Multi-National Context\nAbstract: The expansion of precarious work in recent decades has motivated a large body of research on its implications for health. While considerable work has focused on whether precarious work undermines health, much less is known about why it matters. To fill this gap, this paper offers and tests a conceptual model whereby the effects of precarious work on health are mediated by social marginality, specifically reduced self-efficacy, weaker social integration, and lower social capital. All three mechanisms are understood as both social consequences of precarious work and important determinants of health. Empirically, we use data from the European Social Survey and investigate (1) conditional direct effects of precarious work on self-rated health and (2) extent of mediation via the three mechanisms. Furthermore, we assess the generalizability of the model across five welfare state regimes that prior work has deemed to be important moderators of the health\u2013precarious work relationship. Results indicate precarious work has significant conditional direct effects and indirect effects through all three mediators that significantly reduce effect of precarious work on health. This is robust in the general sample and for four of five welfare state regimes. These findings highlight a previously unexplored vector connecting precarious work to health and indicate that the effects of precarious work on perceptions of self and social relations is a key link to poorer health. The study also expands conceptualization of the broad role of socioeconomic status for health inequalities and furthers understanding of the mechanisms at work.",

Leptomeningeal collateralization was assessed using single-phase computed tomography angiography (grade 0: no filling; grade 1: filling \u2a7d50%; grade 2: filling >50% but <100%; grade 3: filling 100% of the occluded territory). Inverse probability of treatment weighted ordinal regression was performed to assess the association between treatment and shift of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score toward lower categories at 3\u2009months. We used interaction analysis to explore differential treatment effects on functional outcomes (probabilities for each mRS subcategory at 3\u2009months) at different collateral grades.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Among 363 included patients, 62% received MT\u2009+\u2009BMT. Better collateralization was associated with better functional outcomes at 3\u2009months in the BMT alone group (collateral grade 1 vs 0: acOR 5.06, 95% CI 2.33-10.99). MT\u2009+\u2009BMT was associated with higher odds of favorable functional outcome at 3\u2009months (acOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11-2.62) which was consistent after adjustment for collateral status (acOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01-2.35). Regarding treatment effect modification, patients with absent collateralization had higher probabilities for a mRS of 0-4 and a lower mortality at 3\u2009months for the MT\u2009+\u2009BMT group.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In the 6-to-24-h time window, aLVO patients with absent leptomeningeal collateralization benefit most from MT\u2009+\u2009BMT, indicating potential advantages for this group despite their poorer baseline prognosis.",

Device-based therapies have been investigated to overcome barriers to pharmacotherapy, including non-adherence and low rates of persistence to daily medications. Among these device-based therapies, catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) has been most extensively examined over the past 15 years.

A geospatial analysis\nAbstract: Whilst the problematic of energy poverty has become an important topic in research and policy-making in the Global North in general and in Europe especially, there exists almost no work on energy poverty in Switzerland.This exploratory work aims to perform the first spatial analysis on energy poverty in Switzerland by constructing an energy poverty vulnerability index that is composed of data of the Federal Register of Buildings and Dwellings (RBD) as well as the Swiss-SEP (socioeconomic position). Besides the implementation of the indicator on a national level, the situation regarding energy poverty vulnerability is analysed on a higher resolution for the City of Zurich. Furthermore, this work assesses the suitability and quality of the available data to analyse energy poverty in Switzerland and evaluates the implementation of energy poverty related policy measures. The spatial analysis shows that on a national level, households in rural regions have a higher risk to be affected by energy poverty than in cities. Further, households in mountainous regions are affected by a higher vulnerability of energy poverty due to colder climate. The vulnerability of Zurich appeared rather low at a coarse resolution. However, the visualization of the data on a smaller scale revealed big differences within the city boundaries, with a rather high energy poverty vulnerability index towards the outskirts of the city. The RBD and Swiss-SEP allow to perform an analysis on a neighborhood-scale on energy poverty vulnerability, but some drawbacks regarding data quality were identified. It was found that in Switzerland hardly any measures against energy poverty specifically are taken, which needs to be reconsidered. Future work to improve the indicator is proposed.",

The present study examined whether maternal depressive symptoms during early childhood predict children\u2019s friendship quality into adolescence, and whether observed negative parenting behavior and children\u2019s earlier friendship quality, social skills, and their own depressive symptoms in middle childhood mediate these associations. We used six waves of data from a prospective longitudinal community sample (N = 396). The study followed children and their mothers across 13 years from child ages 2\u201315 years (52% female, 67% White, 26% Black), collecting multi-informant data (from mothers, children, teachers, and behavioral observations). The significance of indirect effects was estimated with structural equation modeling. Exposure to high levels of maternal depressive symptoms in early childhood (child ages 2\u20135 years) was negatively correlated with children\u2019s later adolescent friendship quality (at age 15). Structural equation models revealed that this association was mediated by children\u2019s poorer social skills (age 7) and friendship quality (age 10). Negative parenting behavior and children\u2019s depressive symptoms did not mediate this association. Maternal depressive symptoms have downstream associations with children\u2019s friendship quality into adolescence, including via children\u2019s social skills. Promoting the social skills of children exposed to maternal depressive symptoms could have long-term positive effects.",

The aim of this study was to assess adherence to this guideline and to assess changes in management before and after guideline implementation. The primary outcome was the overall adherence rate to the guideline. Additionally, we evaluated specific omissions of guideline steps by clinicians and investigated differences in adherence for infants younger vs older than six months, as well as variations between in- and outpatient care. Secondary outcomes focused on changes in the frequency of involvement of the child protection team, skeletal survey rates and child abuse detection, comparing these rates before and after guideline implementation.\r\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-centre quality control study. We included infants younger than 12 months diagnosed with fractures at the emergency department between 1 February 2021 and 31 August 2022. We excluded children with prior bone disease diagnoses and those whose parents did not consent to their children\u2019s data being used for research.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 61 emergency department visits of infants with fractures were included in the study. The overall adherence rate to the guideline was 39%. Notably, in 68% of cases where clinicians deviated from the guideline, the primary reason was a missing consultation of the paediatrician or family doctor. Adherence levels were consistent across age groups (under and over six months), but there was a notable discrepancy between inpatient (53%) and outpatient (26%) care settings. Child protection team involvement increased to 54%, twice the rate observed before guideline implementation.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall adherence to the guideline was poor, emphasising the necessity for continuous training of clinicians to raise awareness regarding the differential diagnosis of child abuse. Despite the guideline\u2019s implementation leading to a doubled rate of child protection team involvement, there remains a need for improvement. Notably, outpatient care exhibited lower guideline adherence, signalling an area requiring focused attention.",

        "document": "Title: ESR Essentials: imaging in fibrotic lung diseases-practice recommendations by the European Society of Thoracic Imaging\nAbstract: Fibrotic lung diseases (FLDs) represent a subgroup of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), which can progress over time and carry a poor prognosis. Imaging has increased diagnostic discrimination in the evaluation of FLDs. International guidelines have stated the role of radiologists in the diagnosis and management of FLDs, in the context of the interdisciplinary discussion. Chest computed tomography (CT) with high-resolution technique is recommended to correctly recognise signs, patterns, and distribution of individual FLDs. Radiologists may be the first to recognise the presence of previously unknown interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) in various settings. A systematic approach to CT images may lead to a non-invasive diagnosis of FLDs. Careful comparison of serial CT exams is crucial in determining either disease progression or supervening complications. This 'Essentials' aims to provide radiologists a concise and practical approach to FLDs, focusing on CT technical requirements, pattern recognition, and assessment of disease progression and complications. Hot topics such as ILAs and progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) are also discussed. KEY POINTS: Chest CT with high-resolution technique is the recommended imaging modality to diagnose pulmonary fibrosis. CT pattern recognition is central for an accurate diagnosis of fibrotic lung diseases (FLDs) by interdisciplinary discussion. Radiologists are to evaluate disease behaviour by accurately comparing serial CT scans.",

        "document": "Title: Nature and management of melanoma recurrences following adjuvant anti-PD-1 based therapy\nAbstract: Introduction\r\nApproximately 50 % of resected stage II-IV melanoma patients develop recurrent disease by 5 years despite adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy. Data to define best management of recurrences is lacking.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThis was a multicentre, international, retrospective cohort study. Patients with resected stage II-IV melanoma who commenced adjuvant anti-PD-1-based therapy before January 2022 and later recurred were identified. Data on demographics, disease characteristics, recurrence patterns, management and outcomes were collected.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n711 patients from 17 sites were included. Median age was 60 [range 16\u201392], 64 % were male, 2 % stage II, 91 % were stage III, 7 % stage IV. Median time to recurrence was 6.2 months (0\u201368.5) and median follow up time from recurrence was 19.8 months (range 0.2\u201373.1). 63 % recurred on anti-PD-1 therapy, 36 % off therapy [3 % < 6 months, 33 % > 6 months]. Initial recurrences were locoregional (LR) alone in 44 %, distant alone (DR) in 43 %, and 11 % in both sites. LR recurrences were managed with local therapy, alone (62 %) or with \u201csecond adjuvant\u201d anti-PD-1 (14 %) or BRAF/MEK therapy (23 %); 12 m RFS2 was 25 %, 29 % and 69 % respectively (p = 0.0045). Definitive systemic therapy at first recurrence was given in 16 % LR and 86 % DR, with best outcomes for anti-CTLA4 + anti-PD-1 and trial combinations (24 m PFS 63 % and 69 %, respectively). The 24 m OS for the entire cohort was 65 %.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nMost recurrences following adjuvant anti-PD-1 based therapy occur early and while still on drug. Outcomes are poor, regardless of site, timing of recurrence, and subsequent treatment.",

        "document": "Title: Automatic Medical Text Simplification: Challenges of Data Quality and Curation\nAbstract: Health Literacy is the degree to which individuals can comprehend basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions. The topmost reason for low health literacy is the vocabulary gap between providers and patients. Automatic medical text simplification can contribute to improving health literacy by assisting providers with patientfriendly communication, improving health data search, and making online medical texts more accessible. It is, however, extremely challenging to curate quality corpus for this natural language processing (NLP) task. In this position paper, we observe that, despite recent research efforts, existing open corpora for medical text simplification are poor in quality and size. In order to match the progress in general text simplification and style transfer, we must leverage careful crowdsourcing. We discuss the challenges of naive crowd-sourcing. We propose that careful crowd-sourcing for medical text simplification is possible, when combined with automatic data labeling, a well-designed expert-layman collaboration framework, and context-dependent crowd-sourcing instructions.",

        "document": "Title: Late presentations and missed opportunities among newly diagnosed HIV patients presenting to a specialty clinic in Lebanon\nAbstract: Late presentation to medical care of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is linked to poor outcomes and increased morbidity and mortality. Missed opportunities for a prompt diagnosis are frequently reported among late presenters. We aimed to estimate the proportion of late presenters and missed opportunities in diagnosis among newly diagnosed HIV-positive subjects presenting to a specialty clinic in Lebanon. This is a retrospective chart review of all newly diagnosed adult HIV-positive subjects presenting to clinic from 2012 to 2022. Demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were collected at initial HIV diagnosis or presentation to medical care. We defined late presentation as having a CD4 count\u2009<\u2009350 or AIDS-defining event regardless of CD4 count. Advanced disease is defined as having a CD4 count below 200 cells/\u03bcL or the presence of an AIDS-defining illness, regardless of the CD4 count. A missed opportunity was defined as the presence of an indicator condition (IC) that suggests infection with HIV/AIDS during 3\u00a0years preceding the actual HIV diagnosis and not followed by a recommendation for HIV testing. The proportions for demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics are calculated by excluding cases with missing information from the denominator. Our cohort included 150 subjects (92.7% males; 63.6% men who have sex with men (MSM); 33.3% heterosexuals; median age 30.5\u00a0years at diagnosis). 77 (51.3%) were late presenters and 53 (35.3% of all subjects, 68.8% of late presenters) had advanced HIV on presentation. Up to 76.5% of late presenters had a presentation with an HIV-related condition at a healthcare provider without getting HIV test within the previous 3\u00a0years. The most frequent ICs were weight loss, generalized lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, and chronic idiopathic diarrhea. Overall mortality rate was 4% (6/150 individuals). All-cause mortality among those who presented with AIDS was 15.4% (6/39 subjects). In our setting, late presentations and missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis are common. In the Middle East, AIDS mortality remains high with a large gap in HIV testing. To effectively influence policies, comprehensive analyses should focus on estimating the preventable health and financial burdens of late HIV presentations. Another concern pertains to healthcare providers' attitudes and competencies.",

        "document": "Title: Socioeconomic Status and Adherence to Preventive Measures During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Switzerland: A Population Based Digital Cohort Analysis\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nTo assess the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and self-reported adherence to preventive measures in Switzerland during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\n4,299 participants from a digital cohort were followed between September 2020 and November 2021. Baseline equivalised disposable income and education were used as SES proxies. Adherence was assessed over time. We investigated the association between SES and adherence using multivariable mixed logistic regression, stratifying by age (below/above 65 years) and two periods (before/after June 2021, to account for changes in vaccine coverage and epidemiological situation).\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nAdherence was high across all SES strata before June 2021. After, participants with higher equivalised disposable income were less likely to adhere to preventive measures compared to participants in the first (low) quartile [second (Adj.OR, 95% CI) (0.56, 0.37-0.85), third (0.38, 0.23-0.64), fourth (0.60, 0.36-0.98)]. We observed similar results for education.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nNo differences by SES were found during the period with high SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates and stringent measures. Following the broad availability of vaccines, lower incidence, and eased measures, differences by SES started to emerge. Our study highlights the need for contextual interpretation when assessing SES impact on adherence to preventive measures.",
